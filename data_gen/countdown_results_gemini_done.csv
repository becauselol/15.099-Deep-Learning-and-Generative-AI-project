449,521,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 73, 75, and 18 to equal 16.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combinations:
1. (73 + 75) - 18 = 148 - 18 = 130 (Too high)
2. (73 - 75) + 18 = -2 + 18 = 16 (This works!)
3. (75 - 73) + 18 = 2 + 18 = 20 (Too high)
4. (75 + 18) - 73 = 93 - 73 = 20 (Too high)
5. (73 * 18) / 75 = 1314 / 75 (Not an integer, unlikely to be 16)
6. (75 * 18) / 73 = 1350 / 73 (Not an integer)
7. 73 + (75 / 18) (Not an integer)
8. 73 - (75 / 18) (Not an integer)
9. 75 - (73 / 18) (Not an integer)

11. 18 + (73 / 75) (Not an integer)
12. 18 - (73 / 75) (Not an integer)
13. 73 - 75 + 18 = -2 + 18 = 16. This is the one.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Numbers used: 73, 75, 18 (exactly once) - Yes
- Operations used: -, + (allowed) - Yes
- Result: 16 - Yes

The equation is 73 - 75 + 18 = 16.

4530,1818,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 15, 18, and 71, along with the operators +, -, *, /, to equal 74. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (71):**
    *   71 + ? = 74. This means the remaining numbers (15, 18) must combine to 3.
        *   18 - 15 = 3. This works!
        *   Equation: 71 + (18 - 15) = 74.
        *   Check: 71 + 3 = 74. This is correct.

2.  **Try other combinations just to be sure:**
    *   71 - ? = 74. This would require a negative number, which isn't directly achievable with positive numbers and basic operations in a simple way.
    *   71 * ? = 74. Not possible with 15 and 18.
    *   71 / ? = 74. Not possible.

    *   **Start with 18:**
        *   18 * ? + ? = 74
        *   18 + ? * ? = 74
        *   18 - ? * ? = 74
        *   18 / ? + ? = 74

    *   **Start with 15:**
        *   15 * ? + ? = 74
        *   15 + ? * ? = 74
        *   15 - ? * ? = 74
        *   15 / ? + ? = 74

The first combination found (71 + (18 - 15)) seems to be the most straightforward and correct.

Let's verify the constraints:
*   Numbers used: 15, 18, 71 (each exactly once). Yes.
*   Operators used: +, - (from the allowed set). Yes.
*   Result: 74. Yes.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 1, 70, and 84, and the operations +, -, *, /.
The target value is 14.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combinations:

1.  (84 / 70) * 1 - This won't work, 84/70 is not an integer.
2.  (84 / 1) - 70 = 84 - 70 = 14. This works!
3.  (70 / 1) - 84 = 70 - 84 = -14. Not the target.
4.  (84 - 70) * 1 = 14 * 1 = 14. This also works!
5.  (70 - 84) * 1 = -14 * 1 = -14. Not the target.
6.  (84 + 70) / 1 = 154. Not the target.
7.  (84 * 1) - 70 = 84 - 70 = 14. This also works!
8.  (70 * 1) - 84 = 70 - 84 = -14. Not the target.
9.  84 - (70 * 1) = 84 - 70 = 14. This also works!
10. 70 - (84 * 1) = 70 - 84 = -14. Not the target.
11. 84 / (70 / 1) = 84 / 70. Not integer.
12. 70 / (84 / 1) = 70 / 84. Not integer.
13. 1 * (84 - 70) = 1 * 14 = 14. This also works!
14. 1 * (84 / 70) - Not integer.
15. 1 + 84 - 70 = 85 - 70 = 15. Not the target.
16. 1 + 70 - 84 = 71 - 84 = -13. Not the target.
17. 84 + 1 - 70 = 85 - 70 = 15. Not the target.
18. 70 + 1 - 84 = 71 - 84 = -13. Not the target.
19. 84 - 1 - 70 = 83 - 70 = 13. Not the target.

21. 84 - 70 - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13. Not the target.
22. 70 - 84 - 1 = -14 - 1 = -15. Not the target.

The simplest ones are (84 / 1) - 70 and (84 - 70) * 1 and (84 * 1) - 70 and 84 - (70 * 1) and 1 * (84 - 70).
I will choose (84 / 1) - 70 as it uses division and subtraction.
Let's double check:
Numbers used: 84, 1, 70. All used exactly once.
Operations used: /, -. Allowed.
Result: (84 / 1) - 70 = 84 - 70 = 14. Correct.

Another option: (84 - 70) * 1
Numbers used: 84, 70, 1. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, *. Allowed.
Result: (84 - 70) * 1 = 14 * 1 = 14. Correct.

The problem asks me to combine the numbers [61, 26, 21, 20] using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to achieve a result of 34. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let the numbers be $n_1 = 61$, $n_2 = 26$, $n_3 = 21$, $n_4 = 20$.
I need to find an expression of the form $n_a \text{ op}_1 n_b \text{ op}_2 n_c \text{ op}_3 n_d = 34$, where $\{a, b, c, d\}$ is a permutation of $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and $\text{op}_i \in \{+, -, *, /\}.$

I will try different combinations and see if I can get close to 34.

Strategy 1: Start with the largest number and try to reduce it.
61 is the largest number. To get to 34, I need to subtract 27.
Can I make 27 from [26, 21, 20]?
26 + 21 = 47 (too large)
26 - 21 = 5
26 * 21 = 546
26 / 21 (not an integer)
21 + 20 = 41
21 - 20 = 1
21 * 20 = 420
21 / 20 (not an integer)
26 + 20 = 46
26 - 20 = 6
26 * 20 = 520
26 / 20 (not an integer)

Let's try combining three numbers to get 27.
Using [26, 21, 20]:
26 + 21 - 20 = 47 - 20 = 27. This works!
So, the equation could be 61 - (26 + 21 - 20) = 34.
Let's check the order of operations.
61 - (26 + 21 - 20) = 61 - (47 - 20) = 61 - 27 = 34.
This uses all numbers [61, 26, 21, 20] exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's explore other possibilities to be thorough.

Strategy 2: Try multiplication to get closer to 34.
Possible products:
26 * 21 = 546 (too large)
26 * 20 = 520 (too large)
21 * 20 = 420 (too large)
61 * 26 (very large)
61 * 21 (very large)
61 * 20 (very large)

What if we multiply two smaller numbers and then combine with the larger ones?
26 * 1 = 26 (if we can make 1 from 21 and 20, e.g., 21-20)
So, 61 - 26 + (21-20) = 35 + 1 = 36 (close, but not 34)
61 - 26 - (21-20) = 35 - 1 = 34. This also works!
Let's check: 61 - 26 - (21 - 20) = 35 - 1 = 34.
This uses [61, 26, 21, 20] and basic operations.

Let's try another combination with multiplication.
20 * 1 = 20 (if we can make 1 from 21 and 26, e.g., 26-21-4, not easy)
20 * 2 = 40 (if we can make 2 from 26 and 21, e.g., 26-21-3, not easy)
20 * 3 = 60 (if we can make 3 from 26 and 21, e.g., 26-21-2, not easy)

Let's try division.
Can we make a number that divides nicely?
20 / ?
21 / ?
26 / ?
61 / ?

Consider combinations that result in numbers around 34.
Maybe a large number divided by something, then add/subtract.
61 / ?
26 / ?
21 / ?
20 / ?

Let's try combining numbers to get a number that, when operated on with another, gets us to 34.
Example: (26 + 20) = 46.
Can we get 34 from 61, 21, and 46?
61 - 46 = 15. Need to get 15 from 21. No.
61 + 46 = 107.
46 - 21 = 25. Need to get 25 from 61. No.
46 + 21 = 67.

Example: (21 + 20) = 41.
Can we get 34 from 61, 26, and 41?
61 - 41 = 20. Need to get 20 from 26. No.
61 + 41 = 102.
41 - 26 = 15. Need to get 15 from 61. No.
41 + 26 = 67.

Example: (26 - 21) = 5.
Can we get 34 from 61, 20, and 5?
61 - 5 = 56. Need to get 56 from 20. No.
61 + 5 = 66.
5 + 20 = 25. Need to get 25 from 61. No.
61 - 20 - 5 = 41 - 5 = 36 (close)
61 - 20 + 5 = 41 + 5 = 46
61 + 20 - 5 = 81 - 5 = 76

Example: (21 - 20) = 1.
Can we get 34 from 61, 26, and 1?
61 - 26 - 1 = 35 - 1 = 34. This is the second solution found.
61 - 26 + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36.
61 + 26 - 1 = 87 - 1 = 86.

Let's try multiplication with one of the numbers.
20 * 2 = 40. Can we make 2 from [61, 26, 21]?
26 - 21 - 3 = 2. Not easy.
26 / 13 = 2. Can we make 13 from [61, 21]? No.

Let's try division.
Can we make a number that divides 61, 26, 21, or 20 to get a useful result?
20 / 2 = 10. Can we make 2 from [61, 26, 21]?
26 - 21 - 3 = 2.
20 / (26 - 21 - 3) = 20 / 2 = 10.
Now we have 10, 61. Need to get 34.
61 - 10 = 51. No.

Let's revisit the first solution: 61 - (26 + 21 - 20) = 34.
This is a valid solution.

Let's revisit the second solution: 61 - 26 - (21 - 20) = 34.
This is also a valid solution.

Are there any other structures?
(A * B) + C + D
(A * B) - C - D
(A + B) * C + D
(A + B) * C - D

Let's try multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others.
26 * 1 = 26. (21-20=1). 61 - 26 + 1 = 36. 61 - 26 - 1 = 34. (Found)
21 * 1 = 21. (26-20-5=1). 61 - 21 + 5 = 45.

The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers 31, 32, 56, and 41 exactly once to reach the target value of 97. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try combining the numbers.
The target is 97. The numbers are relatively large.

Possible combinations:
- Addition: 31 + 32 + 56 + 41 = 160 (too high)
- Subtraction might be needed.

Let's try grouping:
- (31 + 32) = 63
- (56 + 41) = 97. This is the target! But I need to use all numbers.

Let's try other groupings.
- (31 + 56) = 87
- (32 + 41) = 73

- (31 + 41) = 72
- (32 + 56) = 88

Let's try multiplication.
- 31 * 32 is too large.
- 31 * 56 is too large.
- 31 * 41 is too large.
- 32 * 56 is too large.
- 32 * 41 is too large.
- 56 * 41 is too large.

Division might be tricky as the numbers don't seem to divide nicely into each other to produce integers that would help reach 97.

Let's try a mix of operations.
Target is 97.
Numbers are 31, 32, 56, 41.

Consider the largest numbers first.
56 + 41 = 97. This uses two numbers. I need to incorporate 31 and 32.
If I add 31 and 32, I get 63.
If I subtract 63 from 97, I get 34. This doesn't help.

What if I try to get close to 97 with some numbers and then adjust with others?
- 56 + 41 = 97. How can I use 31 and 32 without changing the sum?
  - (56 + 41) + (31 - 32) = 97 + (-1) = 96 (close)
  - (56 + 41) - (32 - 31) = 97 - 1 = 96 (close)
  - (56 + 41) * (31 / 32) - not integer.
  - (56 + 41) / (31 / 32) - not integer.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe one of the numbers is subtracted from a sum.
- (31 + 32 + 56) - 41 = 119 - 41 = 78 (too low)
- (31 + 32 + 41) - 56 = 104 - 56 = 48 (too low)
- (31 + 56 + 41) - 32 = 128 - 32 = 96 (close)
- (32 + 56 + 41) - 31 = 129 - 31 = 98 (close)

Let's look at 98. I need to get 97.
The equation was (32 + 56 + 41) - 31 = 98.
How can I adjust this by 1?
Maybe I can change the order or operations.

Let's try multiplication with one number and then add/subtract others.
- 31 * 3 = 93 (not using 3)
- 31 * 4 = 124 (not using 4)

Let's try to get a number close to 97 using two numbers and then use the other two.
- 56 + 41 = 97. Need to use 31 and 32.
  - (56 + 41) + (32 - 31) = 97 + 1 = 98 (close)
  - (56 + 41) - (32 - 31) = 97 - 1 = 96 (close)

Let's try another combination that gets close to 97.
- 31 * 3 = 93 (not allowed)
- 32 * 3 = 96 (not allowed)

Let's try subtraction from a larger sum.
- (56 + 41 + 32) - 31 = 129 - 31 = 98.
  I need 97. I got 98. I need to reduce the result by 1.
  The current equation is (56 + 41 + 32) - 31.
  If I change the last operation from -31 to something else.
  What if I subtract 32 instead of adding it?
  (56 + 41) - 32 + 31 = 97 - 32 + 31 = 65 + 31 = 96. (close)
  (56 + 41) + 31 - 32 = 97 + 31 - 32 = 128 - 32 = 96. (close)

Let's re-examine (32 + 56 + 41) - 31 = 98.
The numbers are 31, 32, 56, 41. Target is 97.

Consider the sum of all numbers: 31 + 32 + 56 + 41 = 160.
We need to reduce this by 160 - 97 = 63.
Can we arrange the numbers and operations to subtract 63?
- 31 + 32 = 63.
So, if we have (31 + 32 + 56 + 41) - (31 + 32) ... this uses numbers twice.

Let's try to get 97 directly.
- 56 + 41 = 97. We need to use 31 and 32.
  - (56 + 41) + (31 - 32) = 97 - 1 = 96.
  - (56 + 41) - (32 - 31) = 97 - 1 = 96.

Let's try another combination.
- 31 * 3 = 93 (not allowed)
- 32 * 3 = 96 (not allowed)

What if we multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the others?
- 31 * 32 = 992 (too big)
- 31 * 56 (too big)
- 31 * 41 (too big)
- 32 * 56 (too big)
- 32 * 41 (too big)
- 56 * 41 (too big)

Let's try division.
- 56 / 32 = 1.75
- 56 / 41
- 56 / 31
- 41 / 32
- 41 / 31
- 32 / 31

This suggests division might not be the primary operation to get an integer result easily.

Let's go back to the sums that were close.
- (31 + 56 + 41) - 32 = 128 - 32 = 96.
- (32 + 56 + 41) - 31 = 129 - 31 = 98.

We need 97.
Consider 98: (32 + 56 + 41) - 31.
How can we reduce this by 1?
If we swap the subtraction and addition of 31 and 32.
Let's try: (31 + 56 + 41) - 32 = 96.
Let's try: (31 + 56 + 32) - 41 = 119 - 41 = 78.

32,14,"<think>The problem requires constructing an equation using the numbers 8, 62, and 43 to reach the target result of 27. Only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are allowed, and each number must be used exactly once.

Let's explore possible combinations and operations.

The numbers are 8, 62, 43. The target is 27.

Possible operations:
1. Addition: 8 + 62 + 43 = 113 (Too high)
2. Subtraction:
   - 62 - 43 - 8 = 11 (Too low)
   - 62 - 8 - 43 = 11 (Same)
   - 43 - 8 - 62 = -27 (Close, but negative)
   - 43 - 62 - 8 = -27 (Same)
   - 8 - 43 - 62 = -97 (Too low)
   - 8 - 62 - 43 = -97 (Same)
3. Multiplication:
   - 8 * 62 = 496 (Too high)
   - 8 * 43 = 344 (Too high)
   - 62 * 43 = 2666 (Too high)
4. Division:
   - 62 / 8 (Not an integer)
   - 62 / 43 (Not an integer)
   - 43 / 8 (Not an integer)
   - 43 / 62 (Not an integer)
   - 8 / 62 (Not an integer)
   - 8 / 43 (Not an integer)

Let's try combinations of operations.

We need to get to 27. The numbers are 8, 62, 43.
Notice that 62 and 43 are relatively large. 8 is smaller.

Consider operations that might reduce the numbers or bring them closer to 27.

What if we subtract one of the larger numbers from the other?
62 - 43 = 19.
Now we have 19 and 8. We need to get to 27.
19 + 8 = 27.
This looks promising!
The numbers used are 62, 43, and 8.
The operations used are subtraction and addition.
Each number is used once.
The equation would be (62 - 43) + 8 = 27.

Let's verify this.
Step 1: 62 - 43 = 19
Step 2: 19 + 8 = 27
The result is 27.
The numbers used are 62, 43, and 8. All used once.
The operations are subtraction and addition, which are basic arithmetic.

Let's try another order for subtraction: 43 - 62 = -19.
Then -19 + 8 = -11. Not 27.
Or -19 - 8 = -27. Not 27.

What if we start with 8?
8 + 62 = 70. Then 70 - 43 = 27.
This also works!
The numbers used are 8, 62, and 43. All used once.
The operations are addition and subtraction.
The equation would be (8 + 62) - 43 = 27.

Let's verify this.
Step 1: 8 + 62 = 70
Step 2: 70 - 43 = 27
The result is 27.
The numbers used are 8, 62, and 43. All used once.
The operations are addition and subtraction, which are basic arithmetic.

Both (62 - 43) + 8 = 27 and (8 + 62) - 43 = 27 are valid solutions. I will present one of them.

Let's consider if there are any other possibilities.
What about multiplication and division?
If we multiply, the numbers get large quickly.
8 * 62 = 496. Then 496 - 43 = 453.
8 * 43 = 344. Then 344 - 62 = 282.
62 * 43 = 2666. Then 2666 - 8 = 2658.

What about division?
If we use division, we need to ensure integer results or that the final result is an integer.
For example, if we had (62 / 2) + 8 = 31 + 8 = 39. But we don't have 2.

Let's re-examine the numbers and target: 8, 62, 43 -> 27.
The difference between 62 and 43 is 19. 19 + 8 = 27. This is the most straightforward.
The sum of 8 and 62 is 70. 70 - 43 = 27. This is also straightforward.

Let's try to use multiplication or division in a way that reduces the numbers.
Could we divide one number by another to get a smaller number to work with?
No integer divisions are possible with these numbers.

What if we combine operations differently?
Example: 8 * (something) + or - (something else) = 27.
If we do 8 * 4 = 32. We don't have 4.
If we do 8 * 3 = 24. We don't have 3.

Let's stick with the additive/subtractive combinations as they seem to work directly.
(62 - 43) + 8 = 19 + 8 = 27.
(8 + 62) - 43 = 70 - 43 = 27.

Let's check the constraints again:
- Numbers: [8, 62, 43] - used exactly once.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - only basic arithmetic.
- Result: 27.

Both solutions satisfy these constraints. I will choose one to present.
The equation (62 - 43) + 8 = 27 is a valid solution.
The equation (8 + 62) - 43 = 27 is also a valid solution.

Let's write down the steps for (62 - 43) + 8 = 27.
1. Subtract 43 from 62: 62 - 43 = 19.
2. Add 8 to the result: 19 + 8 = 27.

Let's write down the steps for (8 + 62) - 43 = 27.
1. Add 8 and 62: 8 + 62 = 70.
2. Subtract 43 from the result: 70 - 43 = 27.

I will present the second one as it might be slightly more intuitive to start with addition.
Equation: (8 + 62) - 43 = 27.
Numbers used: 8, 62, 43 (all used once).
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic).
Result: 27.
All constraints are met.

I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 78, 38, and 9, resulting in 31. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [78, 38, 9]
Target result: 31

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. There are a few possible structures for combining three numbers:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try different combinations and see if we can get close to 31.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's consider the numbers and their approximate magnitudes.
78 is the largest.
38 is the next largest.
9 is the smallest.

If I start with 78, how can I get to 31 using 38 and 9?
78 - ? = 31  => ? = 78 - 31 = 47. Can I make 47 from 38 and 9?
   38 + 9 = 47. Yes!
   So, 78 - (38 + 9) = 78 - 47 = 31.
   This uses all numbers (78, 38, 9) exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's verify this.
Numbers used: 78, 38, 9. All used.
Operations used: -, +. Allowed.
Result: 78 - (38 + 9) = 78 - 47 = 31. Correct.

This seems like a valid solution. Let's quickly explore other possibilities to ensure this is the most straightforward or to confirm no other simple combinations work.

What if I start with 38?
38 + ? = 31 => ? = -7. Can I make -7 from 78 and 9?
   78 - 9 = 69 (not -7)
   9 - 78 = -69 (not -7)
   78 * 9 = 702 (not -7)
   78 / 9 = not an integer (not -7)
   9 / 78 = not an integer (not -7)
   So, 38 + (something with 78 and 9) is unlikely to work easily.

38 - ? = 31 => ? = 7. Can I make 7 from 78 and 9?
   78 - 9 = 69 (not 7)
   9 - 78 = -69 (not 7)
   78 / 9 = not integer
   9 / 78 = not integer
   78 * 9 = 702
   No easy way to make 7.

What if multiplication is involved early?
78 * 9 = 702. Then use 38.
   702 + 38 = 740 (too big)
   702 - 38 = 664 (too big)
   38 - 702 = -664 (too small)
   702 / 38 = not integer
   38 / 702 = not integer

78 * 38 = very large.
38 * 9 = 342. Then use 78.
   342 + 78 = 420 (too big)
   342 - 78 = 264 (too big)
   78 - 342 = -264 (too small)
   342 / 78 = not integer
   78 / 342 = not integer

What about division?
78 / 9 = not integer.
78 / 38 = not integer.
38 / 9 = not integer.
9 / 78 = not integer.
9 / 38 = not integer.
38 / 78 = not integer.

It seems that the initial approach of using subtraction with a sum in parentheses is the most direct and likely solution.
78 - (38 + 9) = 31.

Let's consider other parenthesizations for the same operations:
(78 - 38) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 (not 31)
78 - 38 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 (not 31)
78 + (9 - 38) = 78 + (-29) = 49 (not 31)
(78 + 9) - 38 = 87 - 38 = 49 (not 31)
78 + 9 - 38 = 87 - 38 = 49 (not 31)

The structure 78 - (38 + 9) is the one that yields 31.
The numbers are 78, 38, 9.
The operations are -, +.
The result is 31.
All conditions are met.

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by 7, gets close to 60.
60 / 7 is about 8.5. Can I get 8.5 from 86, 83, 99? No, division by 7 is unlikely to be the last step.

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by something else, gets close to 60.
What if 7 is used in subtraction or addition?
(86 - 83) * ? = 3 * ?
(86 - 7) * ? = 79 * ?
(83 - 7) * ? = 76 * ?
(99 - 7) * ? = 92 * ?
(99 - 83) * ? = 16 * ?
(99 - 86) * ? = 13 * ?

Let's try (86 - 7) = 79. Remaining numbers are 83 and 99.
79 + 83 - 99 = 162 - 99 = 63 (Close!)

I must use the numbers 73, 44, 69, and 25 exactly once.
The allowed operations are +, -, *, /.
I need to show my thought process and then present the final equation.

Let's list the numbers: 73, 44, 69, 25. Target: 56.

Initial thoughts:
The numbers are quite spread out. 73 and 69 are large, 44 is medium, and 25 is smaller.
The target 56 is relatively small compared to the larger numbers. This suggests that subtraction or division might be important to reduce the values.

Let's try combining the larger numbers first.
73 + 69 = 142 (Too large)
73 - 69 = 4 (Small, might be useful)
69 - 73 = -4 (Negative, less likely to be useful directly)
73 * 69 = (very large)
73 / 69 = (not an integer)
69 / 73 = (not an integer)

Let's try combining 73 with 44.
73 + 44 = 117
73 - 44 = 29
44 - 73 = -29
73 * 44 = (large)
73 / 44 = (not integer)
44 / 73 = (not integer)

Let's try combining 73 with 25.
73 + 25 = 98
73 - 25 = 48
25 - 73 = -48
73 * 25 = (large)
73 / 25 = (not integer)
25 / 73 = (not integer)

Let's try combining 69 with 44.
69 + 44 = 113
69 - 44 = 25
44 - 69 = -25
69 * 44 = (large)
69 / 44 = (not integer)
44 / 69 = (not integer)

Let's try combining 69 with 25.
69 + 25 = 94
69 - 25 = 44
25 - 69 = -44
69 * 25 = (large)
69 / 25 = (not integer)
25 / 69 = (not integer)

Let's try combining 44 with 25.
44 + 25 = 69
44 - 25 = 19
25 - 44 = -19
44 * 25 = 1100
44 / 25 = (not integer)
25 / 44 = (not integer)

It seems direct combinations of two numbers don't immediately lead to 56 or a number that can easily be manipulated with the remaining two.

Let's consider operations that might result in a number close to 56.
Maybe a large number minus something.
73 - X = 56 => X = 17. Can we make 17 from 44, 69, 25?

(69-44) - 25 = 25 - 25 = 0
(69-25) - 44 = 44 - 44 = 0
(44+25) - 69 = 69 - 69 = 0
(69/?) - ?
(44/?) - ?

Let's try starting with a number and adding/subtracting combinations of the others.
Target: 56. Numbers: 73, 44, 69, 25.

Possibility 1: Start with 73.
73 - (something) = 56 => something = 17.
Can we make 17 from 44, 69, 25?
44 - 25 = 19 (close)
69 - 44 = 25
69 - 25 = 44
44 + 25 = 69
69 + 44 = 113
69 + 25 = 94
(69-44) = 25. 25 and 25. No.
(44+25) = 69. 69 and 69. No.
(69-25) = 44. 44 and 44. No.
What about division?
(69+44)/?
(73+44) = 117. Remaining: 69, 25. 117 - 69 - 25 = 117 - 94 = 23. No.
117 - (69+25) = 23.
117 - (69-25) = 117 - 44 = 73. No.
117 - (25-69) = 117 - (-44) = 161. No.

Let's try combining numbers to get a value that, when operated on with the remaining numbers, yields 56.

Consider the structure (A op B) op (C op D).
Or A op (B op C op D).

Let's try to get a number close to 56 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting.
44 * ?
25 * ?
69 * ?
73 * ?

What if we use division to reduce large numbers?
(73 + 69) / ? = 142 / ?
(73 - 69) / ? = 4 / ?
(69 - 44) / ? = 25 / ?
(44 - 25) / ? = 19 / ?

Let's try to make a number that divides nicely.
Maybe (73+?) / ?
Maybe (44+?) / ?
Maybe (69+?) / ?
Maybe (25+?) / ?

Let's try to get a number that, when multiplied by one of the remaining numbers, gets close to 56.
For example, if we can make 2, then 2 * 25 = 50. Remaining: 73, 44, 69. Can we make 6 from 73, 44, 69?
73 - 69 = 4. 44. No.
73 - 44 = 29. 69. No.
69 - 44 = 25. 73. No.

What if we can make 3? 3 * 25 = 75. Remaining: 73, 44, 69. Need to subtract 19.
73 - 44 = 29. 69. No.
69 - 44 = 25. 73. No.
73 - 69 = 4. 44. No.

What if we can make 4? 4 * 25 = 100. Remaining: 73, 44, 69. Need to subtract 44.
Can we make 44 from 73, 44, 69? Yes, 69 - 25 = 44. But we used 25 already to make the 4. This path is blocked.

Let's try making 4 from the numbers.
73 - 69 = 4. Remaining: 44, 25.
So we have 4, 44, 25. Target 56.
Can we make 56 from 4, 44, 25?
4 * 25 = 100. 100 - 44 = 56.
This looks promising!
The numbers used are 73, 69 (to make 4), and then 4, 25, 44.
So the equation would be (73 - 69) * 25 - 44.
Let's check:
(73 - 69) = 4
4 * 25 = 100
100 - 44 = 56.
This uses 73, 69",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants me to find a single equation using the numbers 52, 32, and 97 to reach the target value of 13.
I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [52, 32, 97]
Target: 13

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations. There are a few possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op b) op c = 13
2. a op (b op c) = 13

Let's try different combinations and operations.

**Attempt 1: Start with 97**
Since 97 is the largest number, I might need to subtract from it or divide it.
Target is 13. 97 - x = 13 means x = 84. Can I make 84 from 52 and 32?
52 + 32 = 84.
So, 97 - (52 + 32) = 97 - 84 = 13.
This uses all numbers (97, 52, 32) exactly once and only uses subtraction and addition.
Let's check the order of operations. Parentheses are allowed implicitly by the structure.
The equation would be 97 - (52 + 32) = 13.

Let's verify this.
Numbers used: 97, 52, 32. All used once.
Operations used: -, +. Allowed.
Result: 97 - (52 + 32) = 97 - 84 = 13. Correct.

This seems like a valid solution. I should explore other possibilities to be thorough, but this one is straightforward and correct.

**Attempt 2: Start with 52**
Can I get 13 from 52 and the other numbers?
Maybe 52 / x = 13? x = 52 / 13 = 4. Can I make 4 from 32 and 97?
32 / 97 is not an integer. 97 / 32 is not an integer. 32 + 97 = 129. 97 - 32 = 65. 32 - 97 = -65. 32 * 97 = large. No easy way to get 4.

Maybe 52 - x = 13? x = 39. Can I make 39 from 32 and 97?
97 - 32 = 65. 32 + 97 = 129. 97 / 32. 32 / 97. No.

Maybe 52 + x = 13? x = -39. Can I make -39 from 32 and 97?
32 - 97 = -65. 97 - 32 = 65. No.

Maybe 52 * x = 13? x = 13/52 = 1/4. Can I make 1/4 from 32 and 97?
32 / 97. 97 / 32. No.

**Attempt 3: Start with 32**
Maybe 32 / x = 13? x = 32/13. Not integer.
Maybe 32 - x = 13? x = 19. Can I make 19 from 52 and 97?
97 - 52 = 45. 52 - 97 = -45. 52 + 97 = 149. No.

Maybe 32 + x = 13? x = -19. Can I make -19 from 52 and 97?
52 - 97 = -45. No.

Maybe 32 * x = 13? x = 13/32. No.

Let's reconsider the first solution: 97 - (52 + 32) = 13.
This is a valid equation.

What about other structures like a op (b op c)?
Let's try 52 + (32 - 97) = 52 + (-65) = -13. Close, but not 13.
Let's try 52 - (32 - 97) = 52 - (-65) = 52 + 65 = 117.
Let's try 52 - (97 - 32) = 52 - 65 = -13. Close.
Let's try 52 + (97 - 32) = 52 + 65 = 117.
Let's try 52 * (97 / 32) - not integer.
Let's try 52 / (97 / 32) - not integer.

Let's try 32 + (52 - 97) = 32 + (-45) = -13. Close.
Let's try 32 - (52 - 97) = 32 - (-45) = 32 + 45 = 77.
Let's try 32 - (97 - 52) = 32 - 45 = -13. Close.
Let's try 32 + (97 - 52) = 32 + 45 = 77.

Let's try 97 + (52 - 32) = 97 + 20 = 117.
Let's try 97 - (52 - 32) = 97 - 20 = 77.
Let's try 97 + (32 - 52) = 97 + (-20) = 77.
Let's try 97 - (32 - 52) = 97 - (-20) = 97 + 20 = 117.

What about division?
(97 + 32) / 52 = 129 / 52 - not integer.
(97 - 32) / 52 = 65 / 52 - not integer.
(52 + 32) / 97 = 84 / 97 - not integer.
(52 - 32) / 97 = 20 / 97 - not integer.
(32 + 52) / 97 = 84 / 97 - not integer.
(32 - 52) / 97 = -20 / 97 - not integer.

(97 + 52) / 32 = 149 / 32 - not integer.
(97 - 52) / 32 = 45 / 32 - not integer.
(52 + 97) / 32 = 149 / 32 - not integer.
(52 - 97) / 32 = -45 / 32 - not integer.
(32 + 97) / 52 = 129 / 52 - not integer.
(32 - 97) / 52 = -65 / 52 - not integer.

Let's try multiplication.
52 * (32 / 97) - not integer.
52 * (97 / 32) - not integer.
32 * (52 / 97) - not integer.
32 * (97 / 52) - not integer.
97 * (52 / 32) - not integer.
97 * (32 / 52) - not integer.

Let's go back to the first solution found: 97 - (52 + 32) = 13.
This is a perfectly valid solution.
The numbers are 52, 32, 97.
The operations are -, +.
The target is 13.
Each number is used exactly once.

Let's consider if there are other ways to express 97 - (52 + 32).
It could be written as 97 - 52 - 32.
97 - 52 = 45.
45 - 32 = 13.
This also works and uses the numbers 97, 52, 32 exactly once with subtraction.
So, 97 - 52 - 32 = 13 is another valid equation.

The user wants me to find an equation using the numbers [75, 57, 80, 39] to reach the target 91.
I must use each number exactly once and only use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 75, 57, 80, 39
Target: 91

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations.
It's often helpful to try to get close to the target first, or to create intermediate numbers that might be useful.

Let's consider the operations and numbers:
- The numbers are relatively large.
- The target is also relatively large, but not extremely so compared to the input numbers. This suggests that division might be less likely to be the final operation unless it's dividing a large number by a small one to get a moderate result. Multiplication might be more likely to be used to increase values, or subtraction to reduce them.

Let's try some initial combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest numbers:**
    *   75 + 57 = 132 (Too high)
    *   75 - 57 = 18
    *   75 * 57 (Too high)

    *   80 / 57 (Not a whole number)

2.  **Try to get close to 91:**
    *   80 + ? = 91 -> ? = 11. Can I make 11 from 75, 57, 39?
        *   75 - 57 = 18. Not 11.

        *   75 / ? = 11 (no)
        *   57 / ? = 11 (no)
        *   39 + ? = 11 (no)
        *   57 + ? = 11 (no)
        *   75 + ? = 11 (no)
        *   It seems unlikely to make exactly 11 from 75, 57, 39.

    *   75 + ? = 91 -> ? = 16. Can I make 16 from 57, 80, 39?
        *   80 - 57 = 23. Not 16.
        *   80 - 39 = 41. Not 16.
        *   57 - 39 = 18. Not 16.
        *   (80 - 57) - 39 = 23 - 39 (negative)
        *   (80 - 39) - 57 = 41 - 57 (negative)
        *   (57 - 39) - 80 = 18 - 80 (negative)
        *   80 / 57 (not whole)
        *   80 / 39 (not whole)

        *   39 / ? = 16 (no)
        *   57 / ? = 16 (no)
        *   80 / ? = 16 -> ? = 5. Can I make 5 from 57, 39? No.

        *   80 + ? = 16 (no)
        *   It seems unlikely to make exactly 16 from 57, 80, 39.

    *   57 + ? = 91 -> ? = 34. Can I make 34 from 75, 80, 39?
        *   75 - 39 = 36. Close!
        *   80 - 39 = 41.
        *   80 - 75 = 5.
        *   Let's try 75 - 39 = 36. We have 80 left. Can we use 80 and 36 to get 34? No.
        *   What if we use 75, 80, 39 to make 34?
            *   (80 - 75) * 39 = 5 * 39 = 195 (too high)
            *   (80 - 39) - 75 = 41 - 75 (negative)
            *   (75 - 39) - 80 = 36 - 80 (negative)
            *   80 - (75 - 39) = 80 - 36 = 44. Not 34.
            *   75 - (80 - 39) = 75 - 41 = 34. This works!
            *   So, we have 57 + (75 - (80 - 39)) = 57 + (75 - 41) = 57 + 34 = 91.
            *   Let's check the numbers used: 57, 75, 80, 39. All used once.
            *   Operations: +, -, -. All basic.
            *   Result: 91. Correct.

Let's write this down and verify.
Equation: 57 + (75 - (80 - 39))

Step 1: 80 - 39 = 41
Step 2: 75 - 41 = 34
Step 3: 57 + 34 = 91

This looks correct.

Let's try another approach to see if there are other solutions or if this one is robust.

3.  **Consider multiplication first:**
    *   39 * ?
        *   39 * 2 = 78. We need 91 - 78 = 13 from 75, 57, 80.
            *   80 - 75 = 5. Not 13.
            *   75 - 57 = 18. Not 13.
            *   80 - 57 = 23. Not 13.
            *   (80 - 75) + 57 = 5 + 57 = 62.
            *   (75 - 57) + 80 = 18 + 80 = 98.
            *   (80 - 57) + 75 = 23 + 75 = 98.

Let's try to combine the numbers in different ways.

First, consider the largest numbers: 56 and 39.
56 + 39 = 95 (Too high)
56 - 39 = 17
39 - 56 = -17
56 * 39 = 2184 (Way too high)
56 / 39 (Not an integer, unlikely to be useful unless combined with multiplication later)

Let's try combining 56 and 27.
56 + 27 = 83 (Too high)
56 - 27 = 29
27 - 56 = -29
56 * 27 = 1512 (Too high)
56 / 27 (Not an integer)

Let's try combining 39 and 27.
39 + 27 = 66 (Too high)
39 - 27 = 12
27 - 39 = -12
39 * 27 = 1053 (Too high)
39 / 27 (Not an integer)

Let's try combining 56 and 7.
56 + 7 = 63 (Close, but need to reduce by 12)
56 - 7 = 49 (Close, need to increase by 2)
56 * 7 = 392 (Too high)
56 / 7 = 8

Let's explore 56 / 7 = 8. The remaining numbers are 27 and 39. We need to get from 8 to 51 using 27 and 39.
8 + 27 + 39 = 74 (Too high)
8 + 27 - 39 = -4 (Too low)
8 - 27 + 39 = 20 (Too low)
8 + 39 - 27 = 20 (Too low)
8 - 39 + 27 = -4 (Too low)
8 * 27 + 39 = 216 + 39 = 255 (Too high)
8 * 39 + 27 = 312 + 27 = 339 (Too high)
8 + (27 * 39) = 8 + 1053 = 1061 (Too high)
8 + (39 / 27) (Not integer)
8 + (27 / 39) (Not integer)
8 * (27 + 39) = 8 * 66 = 528 (Too high)
8 * (39 - 27) = 8 * 12 = 96 (Too high)
8 * (27 - 39) = 8 * -12 = -96 (Too low)

Let's try 56 - 7 = 49. Remaining numbers are 27 and 39. We need to get from 49 to 51, so we need to add 2.
Can we get 2 from 27 and 39?
27 + 39 = 66
27 - 39 = -12
39 - 27 = 12
27 * 39 = 1053
27 / 39 (Not integer)
39 / 27 (Not integer)
No simple way to get 2.

Let's try 56 + 7 = 63. Remaining numbers are 27 and 39. We need to get from 63 to 51, so we need to subtract 12.
Can we get 12 from 27 and 39?
39 - 27 = 12. Yes!
So, (56 + 7) - (39 - 27) = 63 - 12 = 51.
This uses all numbers: 56, 7, 39, 27.
Operations used: +, -, -.

Let's check the order of operations.
(56 + 7) - (39 - 27)
63 - 12
51. This works.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
Consider 39 and 7.
39 + 7 = 46 (Need to add 5)
39 - 7 = 32
7 - 39 = -32
39 * 7 = 273
39 / 7 (Not integer)

Consider 27 and 7.
27 + 7 = 34 (Need to add 17)
27 - 7 = 20
7 - 27 = -20
27 * 7 = 189
27 / 7 (Not integer)

Let's try combining 39 and 27 first.
39 - 27 = 12. Remaining numbers are 56 and 7. We need to get from 12 to 51, so we need to add 39.
Can we get 39 from 56 and 7?
56 - 7 = 49 (Close)
56 + 7 = 63
56 / 7 = 8
No easy way to get 39.

Let's try 39 + 27 = 66. Remaining numbers are 56 and 7. We need to get from 66 to 51, so we need to subtract 15.
Can we get 15 from 56 and 7?
56 - 7 = 49
56 + 7 = 63
56 / 7 = 8
No easy way to get 15.

Let's go back to the successful one: (56 + 7) - (39 - 27).
This is a valid equation.

Let's see if there are other possibilities.
What if we use multiplication early?
7 * 27 = 189 (Too high)
7 * 39 = 273 (Too high)
7 * 56 = 392 (Too high)
27 * 39 = 1053 (Too high)
27 * 56 = 1512 (Too high)
39 * 56 = 2184 (Too high)

What if we use division?
56 / 7 = 8. Remaining: 27, 39. Target: 51.
We tried this: 8 + 27 + 39 = 74. 8 + 39 - 27 = 20.
What about multiplication with the result of division?
(56 / 7) * 39 + 27 = 8 * 39 + 27 = 312 + 27 = 339.
(56 / 7) * 27 + 39 = 8 * 27 + 39 = 216 + 39 = 255.
(56 / 7) * (39 - 27) = 8 * 12 = 96.
(56 / 7) * (39 + 27) = 8 * 66 = 528.

Let's try another division: 27 / ? or 39 / ? or 56 / ?
Only 56 / 7 gives an integer.

Let's try subtraction first.
56 - 39 = 17. Remaining: 7, 27. Target: 51. Need to add 34.
17 + 7 + 27 = 51. This works!
(56 - 39) + 7 + 27 = 17 + 7 + 27 = 24 + 27 = 51.
This uses all numbers: 56, 39, 7, 27.
Operations used: -, +, +.

Let's check the order of operations.
(56 - 39) + 7 + 27
17 + 7 + 27
24 + 27
51. This also works.

Let's try another subtraction.
56 - 27 = 29. Remaining: 7, 39. Target: 51. Need to add 22.

3901,382,"<think>The problem requires me to find an arithmetic equation using the numbers 16, 16, and 36 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, and /, to achieve a result of 37.

I need to explore different combinations of these numbers and operations. The target number is 37, which is relatively close to the given numbers. This suggests that multiplication might be involved, but perhaps not in a way that results in a very large number, or it might be combined with subtraction or addition to fine-tune the result.

Let's list the numbers: 16, 16, 36.
The target is 37.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op b) op c = 37
2. a op (b op c) = 37

Let's try combinations systematically.

**Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.**

*   16 * 16 = 256. This is much larger than 37. To get 37 from 256 and 36, I'd need to subtract a large amount (256 - 36 = 220, not 37) or divide (256 / 36 is not an integer, and 36 / 256 is too small). This path seems unlikely.
*   16 * 36 = 576. Even larger. Unlikely to reach 37.
*   36 * 16 = 576. Same as above.

This suggests that direct multiplication of two numbers might not be the primary operation leading to 37, or if it is, it must be followed by a division that significantly reduces the value.

**Attempt 2: Using division first.**

*   16 / 16 = 1. Now I have 1 and 36.
    *   1 + 36 = 37. This works! The numbers used are 16, 16, and 36. The operations are division and addition. All numbers are used exactly once. The result is 37.
    *   Let's write this out: (16 / 16) + 36 = 1 + 36 = 37. This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other division possibilities just to be thorough.

*   16 / 36. This is not an integer. While allowed, it makes reaching an integer target like 37 more complex.
*   36 / 16. This is not an integer (36/16 = 9/4 = 2.25).

**Attempt 3: Using addition/subtraction first.**

*   16 + 16 = 32. Now I have 32 and 36.
    *   32 + 36 = 68 (too high)
    *   32 - 36 = -4 (too low)
    *   36 - 32 = 4 (too low)
    *   32 * 36 (too high)
    *   32 / 36 (fraction)
    *   36 / 32 (fraction)
*   16 - 16 = 0. Now I have 0 and 36.
    *   0 + 36 = 36 (close, but not 37)
    *   0 - 36 = -36
    *   36 - 0 = 36
    *   0 * 36 = 0
    *   0 / 36 = 0
    *   36 / 0 (undefined)
*   16 + 36 = 52. Now I have 52 and 16.
    *   52 + 16 = 68
    *   52 - 16 = 36
    *   16 - 52 = -36
    *   52 * 16 (too high)
    *   52 / 16 (fraction)
    *   16 / 52 (fraction)
*   16 - 36 = -20. Now I have -20 and 16.
    *   -20 + 16 = -4
    *   -20 - 16 = -36
    *   16 - (-20) = 36
    *   -20 * 16 (too low)
    *   -20 / 16 (fraction)
    *   16 / -20 (fraction)
*   36 - 16 = 20. Now I have 20 and 16.
    *   20 + 16 = 36
    *   20 - 16 = 4
    *   16 - 20 = -4
    *   20 * 16 (too high)
    *   20 / 16 (fraction)
    *   16 / 20 (fraction)

The most promising path was (16 / 16) + 36. Let's double-check the constraints:
- Use all numbers: 16, 16, 36. Yes.
- Use each number exactly once. Yes.
- Use only +, -, *, /. Yes.
- Precisely equal 37. Yes.

The equation is (16 / 16) + 36 = 37.
Parentheses are implied by order of operations, but explicitly stating them makes it clear. If I were to write it without explicit parentheses, it would be 16 / 16 + 36, which by standard order of operations (division before addition) evaluates to 1 + 36 = 37. So, parentheses are not strictly necessary for correctness but can aid clarity. The problem statement doesn't forbid parentheses.

Let's consider if there are other valid solutions.
What if we used subtraction to get close to 37?
Maybe something like 36 + (something small).
We found 16/16 = 1. So 36 + 1 = 37. This is the solution we found.

What about 36 - (something negative)?
Or (something large) - (something large).

Let's try to get 37 using multiplication and subtraction/addition.
Suppose we have 36 * X + Y = 37 or 36 * X - Y = 37.
If X = 1, then 36 + Y = 37, so Y = 1. Can we make 1 from 16 and 16? Yes, 16/16. So 36 + (16/16) = 37. This is the same solution.
If X = 1, then 36 - Y = 37, so Y = -1. Can we make -1 from 16 and 16? No, not directly with one operation.

Suppose we have 16 * X + Y = 37.
If X = 2 (not possible with the remaining numbers).
If X = 36/16 = 9/4 (fraction).
If X = 16/36 (fraction).

Let's consider the structure a op (b op c).
16 / (16 / 36) = 16 * (36/16) = 36. Not 37.
16 / (36 / 16) = 16 * (16/36) = 16 * (4/9) = 64/9. Not 37.
16 + (16 / 36) = 16 + 4/9. Not 37.
16 + (36 / 16) = 16 + 9/4 = 16 + 2.25 = 18.25. Not 37.
16 - (16 / 36) = 16 - 4/9. Not 37.
16 - (36 / 16) = 16 - 9/4 = 16 - 2.25 = 13.75. Not 37.
36 + (16 / 16) = 36 + 1 = 37. This is the solution.
36 - (16 / 16) = 36 - 1 = 35. Not 37.
36 * (16 / 16) = 36 * 1 = 36. Not 37.
36 / (16 / 16) = 36 / 1 = 36. Not 37.

It seems the solution (16 / 16) + 36 = 37 is the most straightforward and likely the only one.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 85.

64 - 85 + 66 = -21 + 66 = 45. Not 83.

The problem requires me to find a mathematical equation using the numbers 15, 89, and 21 exactly once, along with standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 53.

Let's list the numbers: {15, 89, 21}.
The target result is 53.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations. There are 3 numbers, so there are 3! = 6 permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the 4 standard arithmetic operations. This gives 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 possible combinations of operations for each permutation of numbers. However, the order of operations matters (PEMDAS/BODMAS), so I need to consider parentheses as well.

Let's start by trying to combine two numbers first and then incorporate the third.

Possible pairs and their results:
15 + 89 = 104
15 - 89 = -74
15 * 89 = 1335
15 / 89 (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 53 easily)

15 + 21 = 36
15 - 21 = -6

Now, let's try to combine these intermediate results with the remaining number to get 53.

Case 1: Using (15 + 89) = 104. Remaining number is 21.
104 + 21 = 125 (No)
104 - 21 = 83 (No)
104 * 21 = 2184 (No)

Case 2: Using (15 - 89) = -74. Remaining number is 21.

-74 - 21 = -95 (No)
-74 * 21 = -1554 (No)

Case 3: Using (15 * 89) = 1335. Remaining number is 21.
1335 + 21 = 1356 (No)
1335 - 21 = 1314 (No)
1335 * 21 (Too large)
1335 / 21 (No)

Case 4: Using (15 + 21) = 36. Remaining number is 89.

Case 5: Using (15 - 21) = -6. Remaining number is 89.
-6 + 89 = 83 (No)
-6 - 89 = -95 (No)
-6 * 89 = -534 (No)

Case 6: Using (15 * 21) = 315. Remaining number is 89.
315 + 89 = 404 (No)
315 - 89 = 226 (No)
315 * 89 (Too large)
315 / 89 (No)

Case 7: Using (89 + 21) = 110. Remaining number is 15.
110 + 15 = 125 (No)
110 - 15 = 95 (No)
110 * 15 (Too large)
110 / 15 (No)

Case 8: Using (89 - 21) = 68. Remaining number is 15.
68 + 15 = 83 (No)
68 - 15 = 53 (YES! This works!)
So, (89 - 21) - 15 = 53.
Let's check the numbers used: 89, 21, 15. All used once.
Operations: -, -. Standard operations.
Result: 53.

Let's verify this equation:
(89 - 21) - 15

This equation works.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, especially considering division.
Division is tricky because it often results in non-integers. However, if a division results in an integer, it might be useful.
Possible integer divisions:
None of the numbers are directly divisible by another to produce an integer.

21 / 15 (No)

The numbers are quite spread out. 64 and 52 are large. 21 and 5 are smaller.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to 91 by combining two or three numbers.

Let's try combining 64 and 52.
64 + 52 = 116. Need to subtract 116 - 91 = 25. Can I get 25 from 21 and 5? Yes, 21 + 5 = 26, 21 - 5 = 16, 21 * 5 = 105, 21 / 5 is not an integer. So, 21 + 5 doesn't work.

Let's try 64 - 52 = 12. Need to get 91 from 12, 21, 5. This seems unlikely.
Let's try 52 - 64 (not allowed as it would be negative unless part of a larger expression).

Let's try multiplication.
64 * 5 = 320. Too large.
64 * 21 = 1344. Too large.
52 * 5 = 260. Too large.
52 * 21 = 1092. Too large.

Let's try division.
64 / 52 (not integer)
64 / 21 (not integer)
52 / 21 (not integer)
52 / 5 (not integer)
21 / 5 (not integer)

Let's try combining three numbers first.
Maybe create a number close to 91.
64 + 21 = 85. Need 6 from 52 and 5. 52 / 5 is not integer. 52 - 5 = 47. 52 + 5 = 57. 52 * 5 = 260.
64 + 5 = 69. Need 91 - 69 = 22 from 21 and 52. 52 - 21 = 31. 52 + 21 = 73. 52 / 21 (not integer). 21 / 52 (not integer).
52 + 21 = 73. Need 91 - 73 = 18 from 64 and 5. 64 - 5 = 59. 64 + 5 = 69. 64 / 5 (not integer). 5 / 64 (not integer).
52 + 5 = 57. Need 91 - 57 = 34 from 64 and 21. 64 - 21 = 43. 64 + 21 = 85. 64 / 21 (not integer). 21 / 64 (not integer).

Let's try subtraction from a larger number.
Maybe create a number larger than 91 and subtract.
64 + 52 + 5 = 121. Need 121 - 91 = 30 from 21. No.
64 + 52 + 21 = 137. Need 137 - 91 = 46 from 5. No.

Let's consider the target 91. It's 7 * 13.
Can I create 7 and 13 from the numbers?
Numbers: [21, 5, 52, 64]

Can I make 7?
21 / ? = 7. 21 / 3. No 3.
5 + 2 = 7. No 2.
52 / ? = 7. No.
64 / ? = 7. No.

Can I make 13?
21 - ? = 13. 21 - 8. No 8.
52 / 4 = 13. No 4.
64 / ? = 13. No.

Let's try combining numbers to get factors of 91.
Maybe (something) * 7 = 91 or (something) * 13 = 91.

Let's try to make 7.
21 / (something) = 7. Need 3.
(something) - 5 = 7. Need 12.
(something) + 5 = 7. Need 2.
52 / (something) = 7. No.
64 / (something) = 7. No.

Let's try to make 13.
21 - (something) = 13. Need 8.
52 / (something) = 13. Need 4.
64 / (something) = 13. No.

Let's try to make 7 from some numbers and 13 from others.
Numbers: [21, 5, 52, 64]

Can I make 7 from two numbers?
21 / 3 (no 3)
5 + 2 (no 2)
52 / ?
64 / ?

Can I make 13 from two numbers?
21 - 8 (no 8)
52 / 4 (no 4)
64 / ?

Let's try combining three numbers to make 7 or 13.
To make 7:
21 - 5 - ? = 7. 16 - ? = 7. Need 9. No.
21 + 5 - ? = 7. 26 - ? = 7. Need 19. No.
52 - 21 - ? = 7. 31 - ? = 7. Need 24. No.
52 - 5 - ? = 7. 47 - ? = 7. Need 40. No.
64 - 52 - ? = 7. 12 - ? = 7. Need 5. Yes!
So, 64 - 52 - 5 = 7.
The remaining number is 21.
Can I use 21 with 7 to get 91?
7 * 21 = 147. No.
7 + 21 = 28. No.
21 - 7 = 14. No.
21 / 7 = 3. No.

Let's try to make 13.
To make 13:
21 - 5 - ? = 13. 16 - ? = 13. Need 3. No.
52 - 21 - ? = 13. 31 - ? = 13. Need 18. No.
52 - 5 - ? = 13. 47 - ? = 13. Need 34. No.
64 - 52 - ? = 13. 12 - ? = 13. No.
64 - 21 - ? = 13. 43 - ? = 13. Need 30. No.
64 - 5 - ? = 13. 59 - ? = 13. Need 46. No.

Let's try division to create smaller numbers.
64 / 5 = 12.8 (not integer)
64 / 21 (not integer)
52 / 5 (not integer)
52 / 21 (not integer)
21 / 5 (not integer)

Let's try combining numbers to get a number that, when multiplied by one of the remaining numbers, gets close to 91.

Try making 7 from two numbers:
21 / 3 (no 3)
5 + 2 (no 2)

Try making 13 from two numbers:
52 / 4 (no 4)

Let's try making 7 from three numbers:
64 - 52 - 5 = 7. Remaining is 21. 7 * 21 = 147.

Let's try making 13 from three numbers:
52 / (something) = 13. Need 4.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 24, 26, and 28 exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach a target value of 48.

Let's list the numbers: [24, 26, 28]
Target: 48

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to 48.

Possible combinations of two numbers first:
24 + 26 = 50
24 - 26 = -2
26 - 24 = 2
24 * 26 = 624
24 / 26 = (not an integer, likely not useful unless it cancels out later)
26 / 24 = (not an integer)

24 + 28 = 52
24 - 28 = -4
28 - 24 = 4
24 * 28 = 672
24 / 28 = (not an integer)
28 / 24 = (not an integer)

26 + 28 = 54
26 - 28 = -2
28 - 26 = 2
26 * 28 = 728
26 / 28 = (not an integer)
28 / 26 = (not an integer)

Now, let's try incorporating the third number.

Consider combinations that result in numbers close to 48.
If I use 24 and 26, I get 50. How can I use 28 to get 48 from 50?
50 - 2 = 48. Can I get 2 from 28? No, not directly.
What if I subtract something from 50? 50 - x = 48, so x = 2. Can I get 2 from 28? No.
What if I add something to 50? 50 + x = 48, so x = -2. Can I get -2 from 28? No.

Let's try other initial combinations.
If I use 24 and 28, I get 52. How can I use 26 to get 48 from 52?
52 - 4 = 48. Can I get 4 from 26? No.
52 + x = 48, x = -4. Can I get -4 from 26? No.

If I use 26 and 28, I get 54. How can I use 24 to get 48 from 54?
54 - 6 = 48. Can I get 6 from 24? Yes, 24 / 4 = 6, but I don't have a 4.
54 + x = 48, x = -6. Can I get -6 from 24? No.

Let's try multiplication first.
24 * 2 = 48. Can I get 2 from 26 and 28?
28 - 26 = 2.
So, 24 * (28 - 26) = 24 * 2 = 48.
This uses 24, 28, and 26 exactly once.
The operations are multiplication and subtraction.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's double check.
Numbers used: 24, 28, 26. All used exactly once.
Operations used: *, -. These are fundamental arithmetic operations.
Target value: 48.
Equation: 24 * (28 - 26) = 48.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
What if I start with 26?
26 * x = 48? x = 48/26 (not integer)
26 + x = 48? x = 22. Can I get 22 from 24 and 28? 24 - 2 = 22, but I don't have a 2. 28 - 6 = 22, don't have a 6.
26 - x = 48? x = -22.

What if I start with 28?
28 * x = 48? x = 48/28 (not integer)
28 + x = 48? x = 20. Can I get 20 from 24 and 26? 24 - 4 = 20, don't have a 4. 26 - 6 = 20, don't have a 6.
28 - x = 48? x = -20.

Let's consider division.
If I divide one number by another, I get fractions.
24 / 26, 24 / 28, 26 / 24, 26 / 28, 28 / 24, 28 / 26.
These are unlikely to lead to a clean integer result of 48 unless they are part of a larger expression that cancels out the denominator.

Let's revisit the successful attempt: 24 * (28 - 26).
This is a very straightforward solution.

Are there any other possibilities?
Maybe something like (A + B) * C or (A - B) * C or A * B + C etc.

Try (24 + 26) - 28 = 50 - 28 = 22 (not 48)
Try (24 - 26) + 28 = -2 + 28 = 26 (not 48)
Try (26 - 24) + 28 = 2 + 28 = 30 (not 48)

Try (24 + 28) - 26 = 52 - 26 = 26 (not 48)
Try (24 - 28) + 26 = -4 + 26 = 22 (not 48)
Try (28 - 24) + 26 = 4 + 26 = 30 (not 48)

Try (26 + 28) - 24 = 54 - 24 = 30 (not 48)
Try (26 - 28) + 24 = -2 + 24 = 22 (not 48)
Try (28 - 26) + 24 = 2 + 24 = 26 (not 48)

Try 24 * 26 + 28 = 624 + 28 = 652 (too large)
Try 24 * 26 - 28 = 624 - 28 = 596 (too large)
Try 24 * 28 + 26 = 672 + 26 = 698 (too large)
Try 24 * 28 - 26 = 672 - 26 = 646 (too large)
Try 26 * 28 + 24 = 728 + 24 = 752 (too large)
Try 26 * 28 - 24 = 728 - 24 = 704 (too large)

Try 24 + 26 * 28 = 24 + 728 = 752 (too large)
Try 24 - 26 * 28 = 24 - 728 = -704 (too small)
Try 26 + 24 * 28 = 26 + 672 = 698 (too large)
Try 26 - 24 * 28 = 26 - 672 = -646 (too small)
Try 28 + 24 * 26 = 28 + 624 = 652 (too large)
Try 28 - 24 * 26 = 28 - 624 = -596 (too small)

The solution 24 * (28 - 26) = 48 seems to be the most straightforward and likely intended solution.
Let's consider if division could be used in a way that results in 48.
For example, if we could get a large number and divide it down.
(24 * 26 * 28) / x = 48. This would require a very large x.

What about something like (A / B) * C?

4643,1916,"<think>I need to use the numbers 66, 21, and 71 to reach the target number 26. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (71):**
    *   71 - 66 = 5. Then I need to use 21 to get 26 from 5. 5 + 21 = 26. This works!
    *   The equation would be 71 - 66 + 21.

2.  **Check other combinations to be sure, or if the first one didn't work:**
    *   71 - 21 = 50. Need to use 66 to get 26 from 50. 50 - 66 is negative, 50 + 66 is too big.
    *   66 - 21 = 45. Need to use 71 to get 26 from 45. 45 - 71 is negative, 45 + 71 is too big.
    *   66 + 21 = 87. Need to use 71 to get 26 from 87. 87 - 71 = 16 (not 26). 87 + 71 is too big.
    *   66 * 21 is too big.
    *   71 * 21 is too big.
    *   66 / 21 is not a whole number.
    *   71 / 21 is not a whole number.
    *   66 / 71 is not a whole number.
    *   21 / 66 is not a whole number.
    *   21 / 71 is not a whole number.
    *   71 / 66 is not a whole number.

The first combination (71 - 66 + 21) seems to be the correct and simplest one.
Let's verify: 71 - 66 = 5. 5 + 21 = 26.
All numbers (66, 21, 71) are used once. Only basic operations are used. The result is 26.

Let's list the numbers: [56, 27, 42].
The target is 36.

We need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. There are a few possible structures for combining three numbers:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try different combinations and see if we can get close to 36.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's consider the numbers and their relationships.
56 is a multiple of 7 and 8.
27 is 3^3.
42 is 6 * 7.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then operating with the third.

Possibility 1: Start with 56 and 27.
- 56 + 27 = 83. 83 op 42 = 36? 83 - 42 = 41 (close). 83 + 42 = 125. 83 * 42 is too large. 83 / 42 is not an integer.
- 56 - 27 = 29. 29 op 42 = 36? 29 + 42 = 71. 42 - 29 = 13. 29 * 42 is too large. 29 / 42 is not an integer.
- 27 - 56 = -29. -29 op 42 = 36? -29 + 42 = 13. 42 - (-29) = 71.
- 56 * 27 = 1512. Too large.
- 56 / 27 is not an integer.
- 27 / 56 is not an integer.

Possibility 2: Start with 56 and 42.
- 56 + 42 = 98. 98 op 27 = 36? 98 - 27 = 71. 98 + 27 = 125.
- 56 - 42 = 14. 14 op 27 = 36? 14 + 27 = 41 (close). 27 - 14 = 13. 14 * 27 is too large.
- 42 - 56 = -14. -14 op 27 = 36? -14 + 27 = 13. 27 - (-14) = 41.
- 56 * 42 = 2352. Too large.
- 56 / 42 = 4/3 (not integer).
- 42 / 56 = 3/4 (not integer).

Possibility 3: Start with 27 and 42.
- 27 + 42 = 69. 69 op 56 = 36? 69 - 56 = 13. 69 + 56 = 125.
- 42 - 27 = 15. 15 op 56 = 36? 15 + 56 = 71. 56 - 15 = 41 (close).
- 27 - 42 = -15. -15 op 56 = 36? -15 + 56 = 41 (close). 56 - (-15) = 71.
- 27 * 42 = 1134. Too large.
- 27 / 42 is not an integer.
- 42 / 27 is not an integer.

It seems direct addition/subtraction of two numbers then operating with the third isn't immediately yielding 36. Let's re-examine the ""close"" results.

We got 41 multiple times:
- (56 + 27) - 42 = 83 - 42 = 41
- (56 - 42) + 27 = 14 + 27 = 41
- (42 - 27) + 56 = 15 + 56 = 71 (not 41)
- 56 - (42 - 27) = 56 - 15 = 41
- 56 - (27 - 42) = 56 - (-15) = 71 (not 41)
- (27 - 42) + 56 = -15 + 56 = 41

We are looking for 36. The results 41 are very close. This suggests that maybe a small adjustment is needed, or perhaps a different order of operations or a different combination.

Let's consider division.
If we can create a number that, when divided by another, gives a useful result.

What if we try to make a number that divides into one of the given numbers to get something useful?
For example, if we could make 2, then 56/2 = 28. Then 28 op 27 = 36? 28 + 27 = 55. 27 - 28 = -1. 28 - 27 = 1.
If we could make 7, then 42/7 = 6. Then 6 op 56 = 36? 6 + 56 = 62. 56 - 6 = 50. 6 * 56 is too large.
If we could make 14, then 42/14 = 3. Then 3 op 56 = 36? 3 + 56 = 59. 56 - 3 = 53.

Let's try to form 14 using 56 and 27.
56 - 27 = 29 (not 14)
56 / ? = 14 -> ? = 4. Can we make 4 from 27? No.
27 - ? = 14 -> ? = 13. Can we make 13 from 56? No.

Let's try to form 7 using 56 and 27.
56 / 8 = 7. Can we make 8 from 27? No.
27 - 20 = 7. Can we make 20 from 56? No.

Let's try to form 2 using 56 and 42.
56 / 28 = 2. Can we make 28 from 42? No.
42 / 21 = 2. Can we make 21 from 56? No.
56 - 42 = 14.
42 - 56 = -14.

Let's consider the target 36.
Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Can we make 18?
56 - ? = 18 -> ? = 38. Can we make 38 from 27 and 42? 27+42=69, 42-27=15, 27-42=-15, 27*42=1134, 42/27, 27/42. No.
42 - ? = 18 -> ? = 24. Can we make 24 from 56 and 27? 56-27=29, 56+27=83. No.
27 - ? = 18 -> ? = 9. Can we make 9 from 56 and 42? 56-42=14, 56+42=98. No.

Can we make 12?
56 - ? = 12 -> ? = 44. Can we make 44 from 27 and 42? No.
42 - ? = 12 -> ? = 30. Can we make 30 from 56 and 27? No.
27 - ? = 12 -> ? = 15. Can we make 15 from 56 and 42? 56-42=14 (close). 42-56=-14.

The user wants a mathematical equation that evaluates to 47.
The equation must use the numbers 89, 84, and 2 exactly once.
Only the operations +, -, *, / are allowed.

Let's list the numbers: {89, 84, 2}.
The target value is 47.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations to get 47.
There are a few possible arrangements of the numbers and operations.

3983,235,"<think>The problem asks me to use the numbers 4, 20, and 8 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to achieve a result of 48.

Let's list the numbers: {4, 20, 8}.
The target result is 48.

I need to try different combinations of numbers and operations. The order of operations matters, so I should consider parentheses as well.

Possible combinations of two numbers and one operation:
1. 4 + 20 = 24. Then use 8. 24 * 8 = 192 (too high). 24 / 8 = 3 (too low). 24 + 8 = 32 (too low). 24 - 8 = 16 (too low).
2. 4 - 20 = -16. Then use 8. -16 * 8 = -128. -16 / 8 = -2. -16 + 8 = -8. -16 - 8 = -24.
3. 20 - 4 = 16. Then use 8. 16 * 8 = 128 (too high). 16 / 8 = 2 (too low). 16 + 8 = 24 (too low). 16 - 8 = 8 (too low).
4. 4 * 20 = 80. Then use 8. 80 - 8 = 72 (too high). 80 / 8 = 10 (too low). 80 + 8 = 88 (too high). 80 * 8 = 640 (too high).
5. 4 / 20 = 0.2. Then use 8. 0.2 * 8 = 1.6. 0.2 / 8 = 0.025. 0.2 + 8 = 8.2. 0.2 - 8 = -7.8.
6. 20 / 4 = 5. Then use 8. 5 * 8 = 40 (close!). 5 + 8 = 13. 5 - 8 = -3. 5 / 8 = 0.625.
   If 20 / 4 = 5, and we have 5 and 8. We need to get 48.
   Can we combine 5 and 8 to get 48? No, not directly.
   Let's re-evaluate 5 * 8 = 40. We need 48. The remaining number is 4.
   So, we used 20 and 4 to get 5. Then we used 8.
   The expression so far could be (20 / 4) * 8 = 40. We still have the number 4 to use. This doesn't work as we've already used 4.

Let's rethink. The numbers are 4, 20, 8. Target is 48.

Consider the operations on pairs first, then combine with the third.
Possible structures:
(a op b) op c
a op (b op c)

Let's try combinations that might lead to larger numbers, as 48 is larger than any single number. Multiplication is likely involved.

Try using 8 and 4 first.
8 * 4 = 32. Remaining number is 20.
   32 + 20 = 52 (close!)
   32 - 20 = 12
   32 * 20 = 640
   32 / 20 = 1.6

8 + 4 = 12. Remaining number is 20.
   12 * 20 = 240
   12 + 20 = 32
   12 - 20 = -8
   12 / 20 = 0.6

8 - 4 = 4. Remaining number is 20.
   4 * 20 = 80
   4 + 20 = 24
   4 - 20 = -16
   4 / 20 = 0.2

8 / 4 = 2. Remaining number is 20.
   2 * 20 = 40 (close!)
   2 + 20 = 22
   2 - 20 = -18
   2 / 20 = 0.1

Let's look at the ""close"" results: 52 and 40.

Case 1: (8 * 4) + 20 = 32 + 20 = 52. Not 48.
Case 2: (8 / 4) * 20 = 2 * 20 = 40. Not 48.

What if we use 20 and 8 first?
20 * 8 = 160. Remaining number is 4.
   160 / 4 = 40 (close!)
   160 - 4 = 156
   160 + 4 = 164

20 + 8 = 28. Remaining number is 4.
   28 * 4 = 112
   28 + 4 = 32
   28 - 4 = 24
   28 / 4 = 7

20 - 8 = 12. Remaining number is 4.
   12 * 4 = 48. Found it!
   The expression is (20 - 8) * 4.
   Let's check:
   Numbers used: 20, 8, 4. All used exactly once.
   Operations used: -, *. These are fundamental operations.
   Result: (20 - 8) * 4 = 12 * 4 = 48. This matches the target.

Let's verify other possibilities just to be thorough.

20 / 8 = 2.5. Remaining number is 4.
   2.5 * 4 = 10
   2.5 + 4 = 6.5
   2.5 - 4 = -1.5
   2.5 / 4 = 0.625

What if we use 20 and 4 first?
20 * 4 = 80. Remaining number is 8.
   80 - 8 = 72
   80 / 8 = 10
   80 + 8 = 88

20 + 4 = 24. Remaining number is 8.
   24 * 8 = 192
   24 / 8 = 3
   24 + 8 = 32
   24 - 8 = 16

20 - 4 = 16. Remaining number is 8.
   16 * 8 = 128
   16 / 8 = 2
   16 + 8 = 24
   16 - 8 = 8

20 / 4 = 5. Remaining number is 8.
   5 * 8 = 40 (close!)
   5 + 8 = 13
   5 - 8 = -3
   5 / 8 = 0.625

Let's consider the structure a op (b op c).
Example: 4 * (20 - 8) = 4 * 12 = 48. This is the same solution, just written differently due to commutativity of multiplication.
Example: 4 * (8 + 20) = 4 * 28 = 112.
Example: 4 * (20 / 8) = 4 * 2.5 = 10.
Example: 4 + (20 * 8) = 4 + 160 = 164.
Example: 4 + (20 - 8) = 4 + 12 = 16.
Example: 4 + (20 / 8) = 4 + 2.5 = 6.5.
Example: 4 - (20 * 8) = 4 - 160 = -156.
Example: 4 - (20 - 8) = 4 - 12 = -8.
Example: 4 - (20 / 8) = 4 - 2.5 = 1.5.
Example: 4 / (20 - 8) = 4 / 12 = 1/3.

The user wants me to find a single arithmetic equation using the numbers 18, 31, 42, and 40 exactly once.
The equation must evaluate to 80.
I can only use the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: {18, 31, 42, 40}
Target: 80

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations to reach 80.
I will try different combinations and see if I can get close to 80.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can reduce them or combine them to get closer to 80.
2. Try to create intermediate results that are factors or multiples of 80, or numbers that can easily be combined with the remaining numbers to reach 80.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.
- 40 * 18 = 720 (Too large)
- 40 * 31 = 1240 (Too large)
- 40 * 42 = 1680 (Too large)
- 31 * 18 = 558 (Too large)
- 31 * 42 = 1302 (Too large)
- 18 * 42 = 756 (Too large)

This suggests that direct multiplication of two large numbers is unlikely to work unless followed by significant division or subtraction.

Attempt 2: Using division.
- 40 / 18 (not an integer)
- 40 / 31 (not an integer)
- 40 / 42 (not an integer)
- 31 / 18 (not an integer)
- 31 / 42 (not an integer)
- 42 / 18 (not an integer)
- 42 / 31 (not an integer)
- 18 / 42 (not an integer)
- 18 / 31 (not an integer)

Division might be useful if it results in an integer, or if it's part of a larger expression that cancels out fractions.
Let's consider if any number can be divided by another to produce a useful integer.
None of the numbers divide each other cleanly.

Attempt 3: Combining numbers to get close to 80.
Let's try to make a number around 80 using two numbers, then adjust with the other two.

- 40 + 31 = 71. Remaining: {18, 42}. Need 80 - 71 = 9. Can I get 9 from 18 and 42?

  - (31 + 18) / 42 = 49 / 42 (No)
  - (42 + 18) / 31 = 60 / 31 (No)
  - (42 + 31) / 18 = 73 / 18 (No)

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by one of the numbers, gets close to 80.
For example, if we can make 4 from {18, 31, 42}, then 4 * 20 = 80. But 20 is not in the list.
If we can make 2 from {18, 31, 42}, then 40 * 2 = 80. We already tried this.

Let's try to make 80 by adding/subtracting from a larger product.
- 40 * 3 = 120. Can I make 3 from {18, 31, 42}?

  - (42 - 18) / 31 = 24 / 31 (No)
  - (31 - 18) / 42 = 13 / 42 (No)
  - (42 + 18) / 31 = 60 / 31 (No)
  - (31 + 18) / 42 = 49 / 42 (No)

Let's try to make a number that, when added to another number, equals 80.
- 40 + X = 80 => X = 40. Can I make 40 from {18, 31, 42}?
  - 42 - (31 - 18) = 42 - 13 = 29 (No)
  - 42 - (18 - 31) = 42 - (-13) = 55 (No)
  - 31 + 18 - 42 = 49 - 42 = 7 (No)
  - 42 + 18 - 31 = 60 - 31 = 29 (No)
  - 42 + 31 - 18 = 73 - 18 = 55 (No)
  - 18 * (42 / 31) (No)

Let's try to make a number that, when subtracted from another number, equals 80.
- X - 40 = 80 => X = 120. Can I make 120 from {18, 31, 42}?
  - 18 * (42 / 31) (No)
  - 31 * (42 / 18) (No)
  - 42 * (31 / 18) (No)
  - 18 * 31 = 558 (Too large)
  - 18 * 42 = 756 (Too large)
  - 31 * 42 = 1302 (Too large)

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by another number, equals 80.
- X * Y = 80.
  - If Y = 40, X = 2. Can I make 2 from {18, 31, 42}? We tried this.

The problem requires me to form a single equation that evaluates to 22 using the numbers 64, 24, and 18 exactly once. I can only use the operations +, -, *, and /.

Let's list the numbers: {64, 24, 18}.
The target value is 22.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. There are a few possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try different combinations and see if any lead to 22.

Possible pairings and operations:
- 64 and 24:
    - 64 + 24 = 88
    - 64 - 24 = 40
    - 24 - 64 = -40
    - 64 * 24 = 1536
    - 64 / 24 = 8/3 (not an integer, might be tricky to work with)
    - 24 / 64 = 3/8 (not an integer)

- 64 and 18:
    - 64 + 18 = 82
    - 64 - 18 = 46
    - 18 - 64 = -46
    - 64 * 18 = 1152
    - 64 / 18 = 32/9 (not an integer)
    - 18 / 64 = 9/32 (not an integer)

- 24 and 18:
    - 24 + 18 = 42
    - 24 - 18 = 6
    - 18 - 24 = -6
    - 24 * 18 = 432
    - 24 / 18 = 4/3 (not an integer)
    - 18 / 24 = 3/4 (not an integer)

Now, let's try to incorporate the third number.

Strategy 1: Start with a pair that gives a result close to 22 or a number that can easily be manipulated to 22.
The pair (24, 18) gives 24 - 18 = 6.
If we have 6, how can we use 64 to get 22?
- 64 + 6 = 70 (No)
- 64 - 6 = 58 (No)
- 64 * 6 = 384 (No)
- 64 / 6 = 32/3 (No)
- 6 - 64 = -58 (No)
- 6 * 64 = 384 (No)
- 6 / 64 = 3/32 (No)

What if we use 64 first?
- 64 + (24 - 18) = 64 + 6 = 70 (No)
- 64 - (24 - 18) = 64 - 6 = 58 (No)
- (24 - 18) - 64 = 6 - 64 = -58 (No)
- 64 * (24 - 18) = 64 * 6 = 384 (No)
- (24 - 18) * 64 = 6 * 64 = 384 (No)
- 64 / (24 - 18) = 64 / 6 = 32/3 (No)
- (24 - 18) / 64 = 6 / 64 = 3/32 (No)

Let's try 24 + 18 = 42.
How to use 64 with 42 to get 22?
- 64 + 42 = 106 (No)
- 64 - 42 = 22. This looks promising!
So, the equation could be 64 - (24 + 18).
Let's check: 64 - (24 + 18) = 64 - 42 = 22.
This uses 64, 24, and 18 exactly once, and only uses subtraction and addition. This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to be thorough.

Strategy 2: Look for divisions that result in integers.
- 64 / 24 is not integer.
- 64 / 18 is not integer.
- 24 / 18 is not integer.
- 18 / 24 is not integer.
- 24 / 64 is not integer.
- 18 / 64 is not integer.

This means any division must be part of a larger expression that results in an integer before the final calculation, or the division itself must be the final step. However, since the numbers are relatively small, it's unlikely that a division as the final step will yield 22 unless the numerator is a multiple of the denominator and the result is 22.

Let's consider expressions where division might occur within parentheses.
For example, (64 / X) op Y = 22.
Or X op (64 / Y) = 22.

Let's try using 64 and 24.

    *   56 - 27 = 29. Can I get 36 from 29 and 42?
        *   29 + 42 = 71 (no)
        *   42 - 29 = 13 (no)
        *   29 * 42 (too large)
        *   42 / 29 (not integer)
    *   56 - 42 = 14. Can I get 36 from 14 and 27?
        *   14 + 27 = 41 (close, but no)
        *   27 - 14 = 13 (no)
        *   14 * 27 (too large)
        *   27 / 14 (not integer)
    *   42 - 27 = 15. Can I get 36 from 15 and 56?
        *   15 + 56 = 71 (no)
        *   56 - 15 = 41 (close, but no)
        *   15 * 56 (too large)
        *   56 / 15 (not integer)
    *   56 + 27 = 83. Can I get 36 from 83 and 42?
        *   83 - 42 = 41 (close, but no)
        *   42 - 83 (negative)
    *   56 + 42 = 98. Can I get 36 from 98 and 27?

        *   69 - 56 = 13 (no)
        *   56 - 69 (negative)

3.  **Try division as the last step:**
    *   We need a number that divides into something to get 36.
    *   Possible divisors could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
    *   Let's try to make a number that, when divided by one of the given numbers, results in something that can be combined with the remaining number to get 36. This seems complicated.

4.  **Try multiplication as the last step:**
    *   We need a number that, when multiplied by one of the given numbers, results in something that can be combined with the remaining number to get 36.
    *   For example, if we multiply by 2, we'd need to get 18. Can we make 18 from the other two numbers?
        *   If we use 27 * X = Y, and then combine Y with 56 or 42 to get 36.
        *   If we use 42 * X = Y, and then combine Y with 56 or 27 to get 36.
        *   If we use 56 * X = Y, and then combine Y with 27 or 42 to get 36.

5.  **Let's look for common factors or relationships.**
    *   56 = 7 * 8
    *   27 = 3 * 9
    *   42 = 6 * 7

    *   Notice 56 and 42 share a factor of 7.
    *   Notice 27 and 42 share a factor of 3.

    *   What if we try to create a number that, when added to or subtracted from another number, gives a multiple of one of the remaining numbers?

    *   Let's try to get a number close to 36 using two numbers and then adjust with the third.
    *   56 - 42 = 14. We need to get 36 from 14 and 27. 14 + 27 = 41. Close.
    *   42 - 27 = 15. We need to get 36 from 15 and 56. 56 - 15 = 41. Close.
    *   56 - 27 = 29. We need to get 36 from 29 and 42. 42 - 29 = 13. No.

    *   Let's try division first.
    *   42 / 27 (not integer)
    *   56 / 27 (not integer)
    *   56 / 42 (not integer)

    *   What if we try to make a number that is a multiple of 36? Or a number that, when divided by something, gives 36?

    *   Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by one of the numbers, gets us closer.
    *   If we multiply by 2, we need 18. Can we make 18 from 56, 27, 42?
        *   56 - 42 + 27 = 14 + 27 = 41 (no)
        *   42 - 27 + 56 = 15 + 56 = 71 (no)
        *   56 - 27 - 42 = 29 - 42 = -13 (no)

    *   Let's try to make a number that, when divided by one of the numbers, gives a result we can work with.
    *   Consider 42 / (something).
    *   Consider 56 / (something).
    *   Consider 27 / (something).

    *   Let's try to make a number that, when added to or subtracted from another number, results in a multiple of one of the numbers.
    *   Try to make 36 directly.
    *   What if we use 42 and 27? 42 - 27 = 15. We need to get 36 from 15 and 56. 56 - 15 = 41.
    *   What if we use 56 and 27? 56 - 27 = 29. We need to get 36 from 29 and 42. 42 - 29 = 13.
    *   What if we use 56 and 42? 56 - 42 = 14. We need to get 36 from 14 and 27. 14 + 27 = 41.

    *   Let's try division first.
    *   (56 + 42) / 27 = 98 / 27 (not integer)

    *   (27 + 56) / 42 = 83 / 42 (not integer)
    *   (56 - 27) / 42 = 29 / 42 (not integer)

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (77):**
    *   77 - ? = 68. This means ? = 9. Can I get 9 from 56 and 47?
        *   56 - 47 = 9. Yes!
    *   So, the equation would be 77 - (56 - 47).
    *   Let's check: 77 - (56 - 47) = 77 - 9 = 68. This works.

2.  **Try another approach to confirm:**
    *   What if I try to get a number close to 68 using two numbers and then adjust with the third?
    *   56 + 47 = 103. 103 - 77 = 26. Not 68.
    *   56 * 47 is too large.
    *   56 / 47 is not an integer.
    *   77 + 56 = 133. 133 - 47 = 86. Not 68.
    *   77 - 56 = 21. 21 + 47 = 68. This also works!
    *   So, the equation could be (77 - 56) + 47.
    *   Let's check: (77 - 56) + 47 = 21 + 47 = 68. This also works.

Both `77 - (56 - 47)` and `(77 - 56) + 47` are valid solutions. I will present one of them. The first one I found was `77 - (56 - 47)`.

Let's double check the requirements:
- Use numbers [56 77 47]: Yes.
- Result in 68: Yes.
- Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division: Yes (subtraction).
- Each number used precisely once: Yes.
- Intermediate steps in <think>: Done.

The target number is 97.
The available numbers are [98, 13, 15].
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  Start with the largest number, 98.
    *   98 + 13 + 15 = 126 (Too high)
    *   98 + 13 - 15 = 96 (Close!)
    *   98 - 13 + 15 = 100 (Too high)
    *   98 - 13 - 15 = 70 (Too low)
    *   98 * 13 ... (This will be very large, unlikely to get to 97)
    *   98 / 13 ... (Not an integer, unlikely to be useful)

2.  Let's revisit 98 + 13 - 15 = 96. We need to get to 97. This is off by 1.
    Can we rearrange the operations or numbers to get 97?

3.  Consider other starting points or combinations.
    *   What if we multiply two numbers first?
        *   13 * 15 = 195.
            *   195 + 98 = 293 (Too high)
            *   195 - 98 = 97 (This works!)
            *   98 - 195 = -97 (Not the target)

    So, the equation is 13 * 15 - 98 = 97.
    Let's check:
    13 * 15 = 195
    195 - 98 = 97.
    This uses 13, 15, and 98 exactly once. The operations are multiplication and subtraction. The result is 97.

    Another possibility: 15 * 13 - 98 = 97. This is the same.

    What about division?
    *   98 / 13 (not integer)
    *   98 / 15 (not integer)
    *   13 / 15 (not integer)
    *   15 / 13 (not integer)
    *   13 / 98 (not integer)
    *   15 / 98 (not integer)

    It seems the multiplication approach is the most straightforward.

    Let's double check the 98 + 13 - 15 = 96 case. Could we have done something like (98 + 13) - 15? Yes, that's 111 - 15 = 96.
    What about 98 + (13 - 15)? That's 98 + (-2) = 96.
    What about 98 - (15 - 13)? That's 98 - 2 = 96.

    The equation 13 * 15 - 98 = 97 is valid.
    The equation 15 * 13 - 98 = 97 is also valid.

    Let's consider if there are any other possibilities.
    What if we used division in a way that results in an integer?
    None of the numbers divide each other cleanly.

    So, the multiplication path seems to be the only one.
    13 * 15 = 195
    195 - 98 = 97

    The equation is 13 * 15 - 98.
    Or 15 * 13 - 98.
    The order of multiplication doesn't matter.
    The order of subtraction does.

    Let's confirm the format required. ""Provide only the completed equation within <answer></answer> tags.""

    The equation is 13 * 15 - 98.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite large. 66 is a relatively small target. This suggests division or subtraction might be important.

Possible starting points:
- Using 10:
  - 70 / 10 = 7. Then I need to get 66 from 84, 74, and 7. This seems unlikely.
  - 84 / 10 is not an integer.
  - 74 / 10 is not an integer.
  - 70 - 10 = 60. Need 6 from 84, 74. 84 - 74 = 10. Not 6.
  - 84 - 10 = 74. Need 66 from 74, 70. 74 - 70 = 4. Not 66.
  - 74 - 10 = 64. Need 66 from 84, 70. 84 - 70 = 14. Not 66.
  - 84 + 10 = 94. Need 66 from 74, 70. 74 - 70 = 4. 94 - 4 = 90. Not 66.
  - 70 + 10 = 80. Need 66 from 84, 74. 84 - 74 = 10. 80 - 10 = 70. Not 66.
  - 84 * 10 = 840. Too large.
  - 74 * 10 = 740. Too large.
  - 70 * 10 = 700. Too large.

- Using 70 and 74:
  - 74 - 70 = 4. Need 66 from 84, 10, and 4.
    - 84 - 10 = 74. 74 + 4 = 78. Not 66.
    - 84 + 10 = 94. 94 - 4 = 90. Not 66.
    - 84 / 10 is not integer.
    - 10 / 4 is not integer.
    - 84 * 10 = 840. Too large.
    - 84 * 4 = 336. Too large.
    - 10 * 4 = 40. 84 - 40 = 44. Not 66.
    - 84 + 40 = 124. Not 66.

- Using 84 and 70:
  - 84 - 70 = 14. Need 66 from 74, 10, and 14.
    - 74 - 10 = 64. 64 + 14 = 78. Not 66.
    - 74 + 10 = 84. 84 - 14 = 70. Not 66.
    - 74 / 10 not integer.
    - 10 / 14 not integer.
    - 74 * 10 = 740. Too large.
    - 74 * 14 = 1036. Too large.
    - 10 * 14 = 140. 74 - 140 is negative. 140 - 74 = 66. This looks promising!
    - So, (10 * 14) - 74 = 140 - 74 = 66.
    - The 14 came from 84 - 70.
    - So, (10 * (84 - 70)) - 74 = (10 * 14) - 74 = 140 - 74 = 66.
    - Let's check if all numbers are used: 10, 84, 70, 74. Yes.
    - Let's check operations: *, -, -. Yes.

Let's try another path to confirm.
- Using 84 and 74:
  - 84 - 74 = 10. Need 66 from 70, 10, and 10.
    - 70 + 10 = 80. 80 - 10 = 70. Not 66.
    - 70 - 10 = 60. 60 + 10 = 70. Not 66.
    - 70 * 10 = 700. Too large.
    - 10 * 10 = 100. 70 - 100 is negative. 100 - 70 = 30. Not 66.

Let's re-evaluate the promising one: (10 * (84 - 70)) - 74 = 66.
Numbers used: 10, 84, 70, 74. All used once.
Operations: *, -, -. Allowed.
Result: 66. Correct.

Can I rearrange it?
Maybe start with 74?
74 + (something) = 66. This means (something) must be negative.
74 - (something) = 66. This means (something) must be 8.
Can I get 8 from 84, 70, 10?
84 - 70 = 14. 14 - 10 = 4. Not 8.
84 - 10 = 74. 74 - 70 = 4. Not 8.
70 - 10 = 60. 84 - 60 = 24. Not 8.

70 / 10 = 7. 84 - 7 = 77. Not 8.

10 / 84 not integer.

Let's try subtraction from a larger number.
84 - (something) = 66. (something) = 18.
Can I get 18 from 74, 70, 10?
74 - 70 = 4. 4 + 10 = 14. Not 18.
74 - 10 = 64. 64 - 70 is negative.
70 - 10 = 60. 74 - 60 = 14. Not 18.
74 / 10 not integer.
70 / 10 = 7. 74 - 7 = 67. Not 18.
10 / 70 not integer.

Let's try division.
(Something) / (Something else) = 66.
This is unlikely with these numbers.

Let's go back to the successful one: (10 * (84 - 70)) - 74 = 66.
This is a valid solution.

Let's consider other possibilities for 66.
Maybe 70 - 4 = 66. Can I get 4 from 84, 74, 10?
84 - 74 = 10. 10 - 10 = 0. Not 4.
74 - 10 = 64. 84 - 64 = 20. Not 4.
84 / 10 not integer.
74 / 10 not integer.
10 / 10 = 1. 84 - 74 = 10. 10 - 1 = 9. Not 4.

Maybe 74 - 8 = 66. Can I get 8 from 84, 70, 10?
We already checked this and it didn't work.

Maybe 84 - 18 = 66. Can I get 18 from 74, 70, 10?
We already checked this and it didn't work.

Let's try multiplication first.

This is not using the original numbers.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite large, so division or subtraction might be useful to reduce them.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create smaller numbers that can be combined to reach 18.

Let's consider the target 18.
Can I get 18 by adding/subtracting some of these numbers?
49 - 26 = 23. Not close.

49 - 47 = 2.
49 - 17 = 32.
47 - 17 = 30.

Let's try combining operations.
Maybe I can get a number close to 18 and then adjust.

What if I try to make 18 directly?
Can I divide two numbers to get something useful?
49 / ? - not easily divisible by 26, 47, 17.
47 / ? - not easily divisible.

Let's try to create intermediate results.
(49 - 17) = 32. Remaining numbers are 26, 47. Can I get 18 from 32, 26, 47?
32 - 26 = 6. Remaining 47. 6 + 47 = 53. 6 - 47 = -41. 47 - 6 = 41.
32 + 26 = 58. Remaining 47. 58 - 47 = 11. 58 + 47 = 105.
32 * 26 = 832. Too large.
32 / 26 - not integer.

(47 - 17) = 30. Remaining numbers are 49, 26. Can I get 18 from 30, 49, 26?
30 - 26 = 4. Remaining 49. 4 + 49 = 53. 49 - 4 = 45.
30 + 26 = 56. Remaining 49. 56 - 49 = 7.
30 - 49 = -19.
30 + 49 = 79.

(49 - 26) = 23. Remaining numbers are 47, 17. Can I get 18 from 23, 47, 17?
23 - 17 = 6. Remaining 47. 6 + 47 = 53. 47 - 6 = 41.
23 + 17 = 40. Remaining 47. 47 - 40 = 7.
23 - 47 = -24.
23 + 47 = 70.

Let's try multiplication first.
49 * ? - too large.
26 * ? - too large.
47 * ? - too large.
17 * ? - too large.

What if I use division to get smaller numbers?
Maybe I can create a number that divides another number nicely.
For example, can I make 7 from some numbers to divide 49?
49 / 7 = 7.
Can I make 7 from 26, 47, 17?
26 - 17 = 9. Not 7.
47 - 26 = 21. Not 7.
47 - 17 = 30. Not 7.
26 + 17 = 43.
47 + 17 = 64.
47 + 26 = 73.

Let's try to make a number that can be subtracted from a larger number to get 18.
For example, if I have 49, I need to subtract 31. Can I make 31 from 26, 47, 17?
26 + 17 = 43. Not 31.
47 - 26 = 21. Not 31.
47 - 17 = 30. Close.
47 - 17 + 26 = 30 + 26 = 56.
47 - 17 - 26 = 30 - 26 = 4.

What if I try to make a number that, when added to another, gives 18?
For example, if I have 17, I need to add 1. Can I make 1 from 49, 26, 47?
49 - 47 = 2. Not 1.
47 - 26 = 21.
49 - 26 = 23.

Let's try to get a number close to 18 by division.
49 / ?
47 / ?
26 / ?
17 / ?

Consider the numbers again: 49, 26, 47, 17. Target: 18.

Let's try to combine numbers to get a result that can be used with another number.
What if I try to make a number that divides 49 or 47?
Can I make 7 from 26, 47, 17? No.
Can I make 1 from 26, 47, 17? No.

Let's try to make a number that can be multiplied by something to get close to 18.
For example, if I can make 2, then 2 * 9 = 18.
Can I make 2 from 49, 26, 47, 17?
49 - 47 = 2. Yes.
So, I have 2 from (49 - 47). The remaining numbers are 26 and 17.
Can I make 9 from 26 and 17?
26 - 17 = 9. Yes.

So, I have (49 - 47) = 2 and (26 - 17) = 9.
Now I need to combine these to get 18.
2 * 9 = 18.

So the equation is (49 - 47) * (26 - 17).
Let's check:
(49 - 47) = 2
(26 - 17) = 9
2 * 9 = 18.
All numbers (49, 47, 26, 17) are used exactly once.
The operations are subtraction and multiplication.
This works.

Let's write it out clearly.
Numbers: [49, 26, 47, 17]
Target: 18

Step 1: Calculate the difference between 49 and 47.
49 - 47 = 2.
Numbers used: 49, 47. Remaining: 26, 17.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between 26 and 17.
26 - 17 = 9.
Numbers used: 26, 17. Remaining: None.

Step 3: Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2.
2 * 9 = 18.

The equation is (49 - 47) * (26 - 17).
This uses all numbers exactly once and results in 18.
</think><answer>(49 - 47) * (26 - 17)</answer>",1.0,
3333,515,"<think>The problem asks me to find a mathematical equation using the numbers [2, 77, 16, 11] exactly once each, and only the operations +, -, *, /. The target sum is 98.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 2, 77, 16, 11
Target: 98

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to get 98. I can use parentheses to control the order of operations.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 77.
How can I get close to 98 from 77 using the other numbers (2, 16, 11)?
98 - 77 = 21. Can I make 21 from 2, 16, 11?
16 + 11 - 2 = 25 (not 21)
16 + 2 + 11 = 29 (not 21)
16 * 2 - 11 = 32 - 11 = 21. This looks promising!
So, if I can arrange it as 77 + (16 * 2 - 11), let's check:
77 + (32 - 11) = 77 + 21 = 98.
This uses all numbers (77, 16, 2, 11) exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's verify the equation: 77 + (16 * 2 - 11) = 98.
Numbers used: 77, 16, 2, 11. All used once.
Operations used: +, *, -. All allowed.
Result: 77 + (32 - 11) = 77 + 21 = 98. Correct.

This seems to be a valid solution. I should check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one fits all criteria.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
Maybe multiplication first?
11 * 2 = 22. Remaining numbers: 77, 16. Target: 98.
Can I get 98 from 22, 77, 16?
22 + 77 + 16 = 99 + 16 = 115 (too high)
77 + 16 - 22 = 93 - 22 = 71 (too low)
77 - 16 + 22 = 61 + 22 = 83 (too low)
16 * 2 = 32. Remaining numbers: 77, 11. Target: 98.
32 + 77 + 11 = 109 + 11 = 120 (too high)
77 + 11 - 32 = 88 - 32 = 56 (too low)
77 - 11 + 32 = 66 + 32 = 98. This is another solution!
Equation: 77 - 11 + (16 * 2) = 98.
Let's check: 77 - 11 + 32 = 66 + 32 = 98.
Numbers used: 77, 11, 16, 2. All used once.
Operations used: -, +, *. All allowed.
Result: 98. Correct.

So I have found two valid solutions:
1. 77 + (16 * 2 - 11) = 98
2. 77 - 11 + (16 * 2) = 98

The problem asks for ""a mathematical equation"". Either one is fine. I'll present the first one I found.

Let's consider division.
77 / 11 = 7. Remaining numbers: 2, 16. Target: 98.
Can I get 98 from 7, 2, 16?
7 + 2 + 16 = 25 (too low)
7 * 16 + 2 = 112 + 2 = 114 (too high)
7 * 16 - 2 = 112 - 2 = 110 (too high)
7 * 2 + 16 = 14 + 16 = 30 (too low)
7 * 2 * 16 = 14 * 16 = 224 (too high)
16 / 2 = 8. Remaining numbers: 77, 11. Target: 98.
8 + 77 + 11 = 85 + 11 = 96 (close, but not 98)
77 + 11 - 8 = 88 - 8 = 80 (too low)
77 - 11 + 8 = 66 + 8 = 74 (too low)
77 * 11 / 8 (not integer)

Let's re-check the first solution: 77 + (16 * 2 - 11) = 98.
This is a clean and direct solution.

Let's re-check the second solution: 77 - 11 + (16 * 2) = 98.
This is also valid.

I will present the first one.
The equation is 77 + (16 * 2 - 11).
The numbers are 77, 16, 2, 11. All used once.
The operations are +, *, -. All allowed.
The result is 77 + (32 - 11) = 77 + 21 = 98.

The format required is <answer>equation</answer>.
So the answer should be <answer>77 + (16 * 2 - 11)</answer>.

        *   33 + 5 = 38. Yes!
        This uses 58, 25, and 5. The operations used are -, +. I still need to use * and /. This combination doesn't work directly.

6.  **Revisit the successful combinations and try to incorporate the missing operations.**
    *   We found 58 - (25 - 5) = 38. This used -, -, (). We need +, *, /.
    *   We found (58 + 5) - 25 = 38. This used +, -. We need *, /.
    *   We found (58 - 25) + 5 = 38. This used -, +. We need *, /.

Let's try to force multiplication or division in a way that results in a smaller number or a number that can be combined.

Consider (58 - 25) + 5 = 38. We need to use * and /.
What if we multiply 5 by something and then subtract it from 58?
58 - (5 * ?) = 38. This means 5 * ? = 20. ? = 4. We don't have 4.

What if we divide 58 by something?
58 / ? ... not likely to result in a useful integer.

Let's look at the numbers again: 58, 5, 25. Target: 38.
We know 58 - 20 = 38. Can we make 20 using 5 and 25 with * or /? No.
We know 33 + 5 = 38. Can we make 33 using 58 and 25 with * or /? No.
We know 63 - 25 = 38. Can we make 63 using 58 and 5 with * or /? No.

Let's try to get a number close to 38 using multiplication or division first.
5 * 5 = 25 (not helpful, uses 5 twice)
5 * 25 = 125
5 * 58 = 290
25 * 5 = 125
25 * 58 = 1450
58 * 5 = 290
58 * 25 = 1450

25 / 5 = 5
58 / 5 (not integer)
58 / 25 (not integer)
5 / 25 (fraction)
5 / 58 (fraction)
25 / 58 (fraction)

Let's try combining operations.
Consider 58. We need to subtract something to get 38. That something is 20.
Can we make 20 from 5 and 25 using * and /? No.

Consider 25. We need to add something to get 38. That something is 13.
Can we make 13 from 58 and 5 using * and /? No.

Consider 5. We need to add something to get 38. That something is 33.
Can we make 33 from 58 and 25 using * and /? No.

Let's try a structure like (A op B) op C = 38 or A op (B op C) = 38.

Try (58 / 5) ... not integer.
Try (58 * 5) ... 290. Then 290 op 25 = 38? No.
Try (58 + 5) ... 63. Then 63 op 25 = 38? Yes, 63 - 25 = 38. Operations: +, -. Need *, /.
Try (58 - 5) ... 53. Then 53 op 25 = 38? No.
Try (58 * 25) ... 1450. Then 1450 op 5 = 38? No.
Try (58 + 25) ... 83. Then 83 op 5 = 38? No.
Try (58 - 25) ... 33. Then 33 op 5 = 38? Yes, 33 + 5 = 38. Operations: -, +. Need *, /.

Let's look at the numbers again: 58, 5, 25. Target: 38.
We know 58 - 20 = 38.
We know 33 + 5 = 38.
We know 63 - 25 = 38.

Let's try to use multiplication or division to create a number that helps.
What if we multiply 5 by something and then add/subtract from ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
103,1443,"<think>The target number is 68.
The available building blocks are [67, 6, 68, 63].
I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, / to get 68.

Let's try to combine the numbers.
The number 68 is already present. Can I use it directly and make the other numbers cancel out or result in 0?
If I use 68, I have [67, 6, 63] left.
Can I combine 67, 6, and 63 to get 0?
67 + 6 - 63 = 73 - 63 = 10. Not 0.
67 - 6 - 63 = 61 - 63 = -2. Not 0.
67 * 6 - 63 = 402 - 63 = 339. Not 0.
67 / 6 ... not an integer.

What if I don't use 68 directly as the final result?
Let's try to get close to 68 using some numbers and then adjust with others.

Consider the largest numbers: 67 and 63.
67 + 63 = 130.
67 - 63 = 4.
67 * 63 = a large number.
67 / 63 = not an integer.

Let's try combining 67 and 6.
67 + 6 = 73.
67 - 6 = 61.
67 * 6 = 402.
67 / 6 = not an integer.

Let's try combining 63 and 6.
63 + 6 = 69. This is close to 68.
If I have 69, I need to subtract 1.
The remaining numbers are 67 and 68.
Can I get 1 from 67 and 68?
68 - 67 = 1.
So, (63 + 6) - (68 - 67) = 69 - 1 = 68.
This uses all numbers: 63, 6, 68, 67.
The operations are +, -, -.
Let's check the order of operations.
(63 + 6) - (68 - 67) = 69 - 1 = 68. This works.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
Maybe multiplication is involved.
If I multiply 6 by something, what could it be?
6 * 10 = 60. Need 8 more.
Remaining numbers: 67, 68, 63.
Can I get 8 from 67, 68, 63?
68 - 63 - ? = 5 - ?
67 - 63 = 4.
68 - 67 = 1.

Let's try to get 68 by multiplying two numbers.
None of the numbers multiply to 68 directly.
6 * ? = 68 (not integer)
67 * ? = 68 (not integer)
63 * ? = 68 (not integer)
68 * ? = 68 (requires 1, but we have other numbers)

Let's go back to the successful attempt: (63 + 6) - (68 - 67).
This uses 63, 6, 68, 67. All used once.
Operations are +, -, -.
Result is 68.

Let's try to rearrange it slightly.
Could it be 63 + 6 - 68 + 67?
63 + 6 = 69
69 - 68 = 1
1 + 67 = 68.
This also works and uses all numbers exactly once.
63 + 6 - 68 + 67 = 68.

Let's try another combination.
What if we use 67 and 63 to get something close to 68?
67 - 63 = 4.
Remaining numbers: 6, 68.
Can we combine 4, 6, 68 to get 68?
4 * 6 = 24. 24 + 68 = 92. No.
4 + 6 = 10. 10 + 68 = 78. No.
68 - 4 = 64. 64 + 6 = 70. No.
68 / 4 = 17. 17 + 6 = 23. No.

Let's try using 68 and 6.
68 + 6 = 74. Need to subtract 6.
Remaining numbers: 67, 63.
Can we get 6 from 67 and 63?
67 - 63 = 4. No.

68 - 6 = 62. Need to add 6.
Remaining numbers: 67, 63.
Can we get 6 from 67 and 63?
67 - 63 = 4. No.

Let's consider the equation 63 + 6 - 68 + 67 = 68.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there are other possibilities.
What if we use division?
67 / ?
63 / ?
68 / ?
6 / ?

Consider 68.
Can we get 68 by multiplying something by 6?
6 * x = 68. x = 68/6 (not integer).

Can we get 68 by multiplying something by 67?
67 * x = 68. x = 68/67 (not integer).

Can we get 68 by multiplying something by 63?
63 * x = 68. x = 68/63 (not integer).

Let's try to make a number that divides nicely.
Maybe (67 + 63) / ? = 130 / ?
130 / 6 = not integer.
130 / 68 = not integer.

Maybe (67 - 63) * ? = 4 * ?
4 * 6 = 24. Remaining: 68. 24 + 68 = 92. No.
4 * 68 = 272. Remaining: 6. 272 + 6 = 278. No.

Let's re-evaluate the first successful attempt: 63 + 6 - 68 + 67 = 68.
This is a simple and direct solution.

Let's try to use parentheses differently.
(67 + 6) - (63 - 68) = 73 - (-5) = 78. No.
(67 - 6) + (68 - 63) = 61 + 5 = 66. No.
(67 * 6) - (68 + 63) = 402 - 131 = 271. No.

Let's consider the structure of the numbers.
We have 67, 6, 68, 63.
The numbers are relatively close to each other.
The target is 68.

Let's try to get 68 by adding/subtracting the largest numbers.
67 + 63 = 130.
67 - 63 = 4.
68 + 67 = 135.
68 - 67 = 1.
68 + 63 = 131.
68 - 63 = 5.

Consider 67. We need +1.
Remaining: 6, 68, 63.
Can we get 1 from 6, 68, 63?
68 - 63 - 6 = 5 - 6 = -1. Close.
68 - (63 + 6) = 68 - 69 = -1.
So, 67 + (68 - (63 + 6)) = 67 + (-1) = 66. No.

Consider 63. We need +5.
Remaining: 67, 6, 68.
Can we get 5 from 67, 6, 68?
68 - 67 + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7. No.
67 - 6 - 68 = 61 - 68 = -7. No.

3519,1632,"<think>The problem asks me to form an equation using the numbers 33, 60, 3, and 66, each exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 27.

I need to explore different combinations of operations and number placements.

Let's list the numbers: 33, 60, 3, 66.
The target is 27.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create intermediate results that are close to 27 or can easily lead to 27.
3. Consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using division first.
Maybe divide 60 by 3? 60 / 3 = 20.
Now I have 20, 33, 66. Target is 27.
Can I get 7 from 33 and 66? 33 - 66 is negative. 66 - 33 = 33. 33 + 66 = 99. 33 * 66 is large. 66 / 33 = 2.
If I have 20 and 2, I need 7. 20 + 2 = 22. 20 - 2 = 18. 20 * 2 = 40. 20 / 2 = 10. None work.

Attempt 2: Using subtraction with large numbers.
66 - 33 = 33.
Now I have 33, 60, 3. Target is 27.
Can I get -6 from 60 and 3? 60 - 3 = 57. 60 + 3 = 63. 60 * 3 = 180. 60 / 3 = 20.
If I have 33 and need 27, I need to subtract 6.
Can I get 6 from 60 and 3? 60 / (something) = 6? No.
(60 / 3) = 20. 33 - 20 = 13. Not 27.
(60 - 3) = 57. 33 - 57 = -24. Not 27.
(60 + 3) = 63. 33 - 63 = -30. Not 27.

Attempt 3: Try to get a number close to 27 directly.
Maybe 33 - 6 = 27. Can I get 6 from 60, 3, 66?
60 / (something) = 6? No.
(60 / 3) = 20. 66 - 20 = 46.
(60 - 3) = 57.
(60 + 3) = 63.
(60 * 3) = 180.

Let's try combining numbers to get something that can be added or subtracted from another number to reach 27.

Consider 60 and 3. 60 / 3 = 20.
Now I have 20, 33, 66. Target 27.
I need to get 7 from 33 and 66.
66 - 33 = 33. 20 + 33 = 53.
33 - 66 = -33. 20 + (-33) = -13.
66 / 33 = 2. 20 + 2 = 22. 20 - 2 = 18.

Consider 66 and 3. 66 / 3 = 22.
Now I have 22, 33, 60. Target 27.
I need to get 5 from 33 and 60.
60 - 33 = 27. 22 + 27 = 49.
33 - 60 = -27. 22 + (-27) = -5.
60 / 33 is not an integer.
33 / 60 is not an integer.

Consider 33 and 3. 33 / 3 = 11.
Now I have 11, 60, 66. Target 27.
I need to get 16 from 60 and 66.
66 - 60 = 6. 11 + 6 = 17.
60 - 66 = -6. 11 + (-6) = 5.
60 + 66 = 126. 11 + 126 = 137.
60 * 66 is large.
60 / 66 is not integer.
66 / 60 is not integer.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe 3 * 9 = 27. Can I get 9 from 33, 60, 66?
66 / (something) = 9? No.
60 / (something) = 9? No.
(60 + 33) = 93.
(60 - 33) = 27.
(66 - 60) = 6.
(66 - 33) = 33.
(66 / 3) = 22.
(60 / 3) = 20.

Let's try to get 27 by adding or subtracting two numbers.
Possibility 1: A + B = 27.
Possibility 2: A - B = 27.
Possibility 3: B - A = 27.

Let's try to form one part that is close to 27.
How about 60 - 33 = 27?
Then I have 3 and 66 left. I need to use them in a way that doesn't change the result 27.
This means the remaining part must evaluate to 0.
Can I get 0 from 3 and 66 using +, -, *, /?
3 - 66 = -63.
66 - 3 = 63.
3 * 66 = 198.
3 / 66 is not integer.
66 / 3 = 22.
So, (60 - 33) + (3 - 66) = 27 - 63 = -36.
(60 - 33) + (66 - 3) = 27 + 63 = 90.
(60 - 33) * (3 / 66) = 27 * (1/22) = 27/22.
(60 - 33) * (66 / 3) = 27 * 22 = 594.

This approach of getting 27 directly and then using the remaining numbers to make 0 doesn't seem to work easily.

Let's try to build up to 27.
Consider 60 / 3 = 20.
Now I have 20, 33, 66. Target 27.
I need to get 7 from 33 and 66.

What if I use 33 and 66 first?
66 / 33 = 2.
Now I have 2, 60, 3. Target 27.
Can I get 25 from 60 and 3?
60 - 3 = 57. 2 + 57 = 59.
60 + 3 = 63. 2 + 63 = 65.
60 * 3 = 180. 2 + 180 = 182.
60 / 3 = 20. 2 + 20 = 22.

Let's try another combination with 66 and 3.
66 - 3 = 63.
Now I have 63, 33, 60. Target 27.
Can I get -36 from 33 and 60?
33 - 60 = -27. 63 + (-27) = 36.
60 - 33 = 27. 63 + 27 = 90.

Let's try 60 and 66.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(82 - 55) = 27. Remaining numbers are 12, 2.
27 + 12 + 2 = 41. This works!
Equation: (82 - 55) + 12 + 2 = 27 + 12 + 2 = 39 + 2 = 41.
This uses all numbers: 82, 55, 12, 2.
Operations used: -, +, +.

Let's double check the requirements:
- Target number: 41 (Yes)
- Set of numbers: [12, 2, 55, 82] (Yes)
- Use each number precisely once (Yes: 82, 55, 12, 2)
- Only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) (Yes: -, +, +)

110 - 12 - 82 = 110 - 94 = 16.
110 - 12 + 82 = 98 + 82 = 180.
110 + 12 - 82 = 122 - 82 = 40. Close!
110 + 12 + 82 = too large.

Possibility 5:
(12 * 2) = 24. Remaining numbers are 55, 82.
24 + 55 + 82 = too large.

This is a valid solution.

Let's try to use multiplication or division in a way that gets us closer.

82 * 2 = 164.

Consider (82 + 12) = 94. We need to get -53 from 55 and 2.
55 - 2 = 53. So 94 - 53 = 41.
Equation: (82 + 12) - (55 - 2) = 94 - 53 = 41.
This uses all numbers: 82, 12, 55, 2.
Operations used: +, -, -.
This is also a valid solution.

Let's check the first one again: (82 - 55) + 12 + 2 = 41.

    *   81 - 73 = 8. Then I have 60 left. 8 + 60 = 68 (too high). 60 - 8 = 52. This looks promising!
    *   Let's check: (81 - 73) = 8. Then 60 - 8 = 52. This uses 81, 73, and 60.
    *   The equation would be 60 - (81 - 73).

2.  **Let's try another approach to confirm.**
    *   What if I start with 73?
    *   73 - 60 = 13. I have 81 left. 81 - 13 = 68 (too high). 13 + 81 = 94 (too high).
    *   73 + 60 = 133. I have 81 left. 133 - 81 = 52. This also works!
    *   The equation would be (73 + 60) - 81.

3.  **Let's try starting with 60.**
    *   60 + 73 = 133. 133 - 81 = 52. (Same as above)
    *   60 - 73 = -13. 81 - (-13) = 94. (-13) + 81 = 68.
    *   60 * 73 = 4380. Too big.
    *   60 / 73 = not a whole number.

4.  **Let's try starting with 81 and adding/multiplying.**
    *   81 + 73 = 154. 154 - 60 = 94.
    *   81 + 60 = 141. 141 - 73 = 68.
    *   81 * 73 = too big.
    *   81 * 60 = too big.

5.  **Let's re-evaluate the first successful attempt: 60 - (81 - 73).**
    *   81 - 73 = 8.
    *   60 - 8 = 52.
    *   This uses 60, 81, and 73 exactly once. The operations are subtraction. This is a valid solution.

6.  **Let's re-evaluate the second successful attempt: (73 + 60) - 81.**
    *   73 + 60 = 133.
    *   133 - 81 = 52.
    *   This uses 73, 60, and 81 exactly once. The operations are addition and subtraction. This is also a valid solution.

Both 60 - (81 - 73) and (73 + 60) - 81 work. I will present one of them. The second one seems slightly more straightforward.

Double-check:
Numbers: [73, 60, 81]
Target: 52
Equation: (73 + 60) - 81
Step 1: 73 + 60 = 133
Step 2: 133 - 81 = 52
All numbers used once. Operations are valid. Target reached.

Alternative check:
Equation: 60 - (81 - 73)
Step 1: 81 - 73 = 8
Step 2: 60 - 8 = 52
All numbers used once. Operations are valid. Target reached.

I'll go with the second one as it's a bit more common to see addition first.

2884,1178,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 44, 18, and 89 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target value of 27.

Let's list the numbers: {44, 18, 89}
Target: 27

I need to combine these three numbers. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for the operations, and each operation can be one of +, -, *, /. This gives a lot of possibilities.

Let's try to combine them in different orders and see if we can get close to 27.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's consider the numbers and their relationships.
44 is relatively large.
18 is medium.
89 is the largest.

Target is 27.

Let's try to use subtraction to reduce the larger numbers.

Attempt 1: Start with the largest number, 89.
If I subtract something from 89, I need to get a number that, when combined with the remaining numbers, results in 27.
89 - x = 27 => x = 89 - 27 = 62.
Can I make 62 from 44 and 18?
44 + 18 = 62.
So, 89 - (44 + 18) = 89 - 62 = 27.
This uses all numbers (89, 44, 18) exactly once and only uses subtraction and addition.
Let's check the order of operations.
89 - (44 + 18) = 89 - 62 = 27. This works.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or to explore.

Attempt 2: What if I start with 44?
44 op1 18 op2 89 = 27

Try (44 + 18) - 89 = 62 - 89 = -27. Close, but negative.
Try (44 - 18) + 89 = 26 + 89 = 115. Too large.
Try (44 * 18) - 89 = 792 - 89 = 703. Too large.
Try (44 / 18) ... this will result in a fraction, which might be hard to work with to get an integer 27. 44/18 = 22/9. (22/9) + 89 or (22/9) - 89 or 89 - (22/9) or (22/9) * 89. None seem likely to result in 27.

Attempt 3: What if I start with 18?
18 op1 44 op2 89 = 27

Try (18 + 44) - 89 = 62 - 89 = -27. Again, close but negative.
Try (18 - 44) + 89 = -26 + 89 = 63. Too large.
Try (18 * 44) - 89 = 792 - 89 = 703. Too large.

Attempt 4: Let's consider the structure a op1 (b op2 c).
Try 44 + (18 - 89) = 44 + (-71) = -27. Close, but negative.
Try 44 - (18 + 89) = 44 - 107 = -63.
Try 44 - (89 - 18) = 44 - 71 = -27. Close, but negative.
Try 44 - (18 * 89) = 44 - 1582 = -1538.
Try 44 - (89 / 18) = 44 - (89/18). Fraction.

Try 18 + (44 - 89) = 18 + (-45) = -27. Close, but negative.
Try 18 - (44 + 89) = 18 - 133 = -115.
Try 18 - (89 - 44) = 18 - 45 = -27. Close, but negative.

Try 89 + (44 - 18) = 89 + 26 = 115.
Try 89 - (44 + 18) = 89 - 62 = 27. This is the one found in Attempt 1.
Try 89 - (18 + 44) = 89 - 62 = 27. Same as above.
Try 89 - (44 - 18) = 89 - 26 = 63.
Try 89 - (18 - 44) = 89 - (-26) = 89 + 26 = 115.

Let's consider division.
Can we get 27 by dividing?
Maybe something like (X / Y) * Z = 27 or X / (Y / Z) = 27.

Let's try to make a number that divides nicely.
If we have 89 / something, it's unlikely to be an integer.
If we have 44 / something. 44/18 is not integer. 44/89 is not integer.
If we have 18 / something. 18/44 is not integer. 18/89 is not integer.

What if the division is the last operation?
X / Y = 27.
Possible X values:
If Y = 1, X = 27. Can we make 1 from two numbers and 27 from the third? No.
If Y = 2, X = 54. Can we make 2 from two numbers and 54 from the third?
  Numbers are {44, 18, 89}.
  Can we make 2 from {44, 18}? 44-18=26, 44+18=62, 44*18=792, 44/18=22/9, 18/44=9/22. No.
  Can we make 2 from {44, 89}? No.
  Can we make 2 from {18, 89}? No.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution found: 89 - (44 + 18).
Numbers used: 89, 44, 18. All used once.
Operations used: -, +. Allowed.
Result: 89 - 62 = 27. Correct.

Let's check if there are other valid solutions.
Consider the structure (a op1 b) op2 c.
(44 + 18) - 89 = 62 - 89 = -27.
(44 - 18) + 89 = 26 + 89 = 115.
(18 - 44) + 89 = -26 + 89 = 63.
(89 - 44) + 18 = 45 + 18 = 63.

1206,1460,"<think>The problem asks us to find an equation using the numbers 17, 19, 42, and 76, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 80. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let the four numbers be $a=17$, $b=19$, $c=42$, and $d=76$. We need to find an arrangement and operations such that the expression evaluates to 80.

We have 4 numbers, so there are $4! = 24$ permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are many ways to place the operators and parentheses. This suggests a systematic approach is needed.

Let's consider the target number, 80. It's a relatively small number compared to the product of some of the larger numbers (e.g., 42 * 76 is very large). This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the magnitude.

Let's try to combine the numbers in pairs first and then combine the results.

Possible pairings and operations:
(17 op1 19) op3 (42 op4 76)
(17 op1 42) op3 (19 op4 76)
(17 op1 76) op3 (19 op4 42)

Let's explore some combinations, keeping the target of 80 in mind.

Consider the largest number, 76. How can we get close to 80 using it?
76 + 4 = 80. Can we make 4 from 17, 19, and 42?
19 - 17 = 2. 42 / ? No.
42 - 19 - 17 = 6. No.
(19 - 17) * 42 = 2 * 42 = 84. Close, but not 4.
42 / (19 - 17) = 42 / 2 = 21. No.

Let's try starting with 76 and adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing with other numbers.

Possibility 1: Use 76 as a base.
If we add something to 76: 76 + X = 80, so X = 4. Can we make 4 from 17, 19, 42?
(19 - 17) * 42 = 84. No.
42 / (19 - 17) = 21. No.
(42 / 17) - 19? Not integer.
(42 / 19) - 17? Not integer.
(17 + 19) - 42 = 36 - 42 = -6. No.
42 - (17 + 19) = 42 - 36 = 6. No.
(42 - 17) - 19 = 25 - 19 = 6. No.
(42 - 19) - 17 = 23 - 17 = 6. No.

If we subtract something from 76: 76 - X = 80, so X = -4. Can we make -4 from 17, 19, 42?
17 - 19 = -2. Can we make -2 from 42? No.
19 - 17 = 2. Can we make -2 from 42? No.

If we multiply 76 by something: 76 * X = 80. X = 80/76 = 10/9. Not likely with integers.

If we divide 76 by something: 76 / X = 80. X = 76/80 = 19/20. Not likely.

Let's try combining other numbers first.

Consider the numbers 17 and 19. Their sum is 36, difference is 2, product is 323.
Consider 42 and 76. Their sum is 118, difference is 34, product is 3192.

Let's try to get a number close to 80 by multiplying two numbers.
17 * ?
19 * ?
42 * ?
76 * ?

What if we use multiplication and then add/subtract?
Try multiplying two numbers and then combining with the other two.

Example: (17 * 19) + 42 + 76 = 323 + 42 + 76 = 441. Too large.
Example: (17 * 19) - 42 + 76 = 323 - 42 + 76 = 281 + 76 = 357. Too large.
Example: (17 * 19) + 42 - 76 = 323 + 42 - 76 = 365 - 76 = 289. Too large.

Example: (42 * 76) + 17 + 19 = 3192 + 17 + 19 = 3228. Too large.

It seems direct multiplication of two numbers leads to results far too large. This suggests division or subtraction must play a significant role in reducing the numbers.

Let's consider division.
Can we divide a larger number by a smaller one to get a useful intermediate result?
42 / 17? Not integer.
42 / 19? Not integer.
76 / 17? Not integer.
76 / 19? Not integer.
76 / 42? Not integer.

What if we form a denominator from multiple numbers?
Example: 76 / (19 - 17) = 76 / 2 = 38.
Now we have 38, 42, and the remaining number is 17.
Can we combine 38, 42, 17 to get 80?
38 + 42 = 80. We still have 17 left. This doesn't work.
38 + 42 + 17 = 97.
38 + 42 - 17 = 63.
38 - 42 + 17 = 13.

The user wants a mathematical equation that results in 11, using the numbers 81, 7, and 63 exactly once. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the operands: [81, 7, 63].
The target result is 11.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. There are a few ways to group three numbers:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try different combinations and see if we can get close to 11.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's consider the numbers: 81, 7, 63.
Notice that 81 and 63 are multiples of 9. 81 = 9 * 9, 63 = 9 * 7.
Also, 63 is a multiple of 7 (63 = 9 * 7). This might be useful.

Let's try using division first, as it can reduce large numbers.
- 81 / 7: Not an integer. (approx 11.57)
- 81 / 63: Not an integer. (approx 1.28)
- 63 / 7: This is an integer! 63 / 7 = 9.

This looks promising. If we have 9, we need to combine it with 81 to get 11.
So, we have (63 / 7) = 9.
Now we need to use 81 and the result 9 to get 11.
Possible combinations:
- 9 + 81 = 90 (Too large)
- 9 - 81 = -72 (Too small)
- 81 - 9 = 72 (Too large)
- 9 * 81 = 729 (Too large)
- 81 / 9 = 9 (Not 11)

This path (starting with 63/7) doesn't seem to lead directly to 11.

Let's try another division: 81 / 9. But 9 is not in the list.

Let's try multiplication.
- 81 * 7 = 567 (Too large)
- 81 * 63 = Very large
- 7 * 63 = 441 (Too large)

Let's try subtraction.
- 81 - 7 = 74. Now use 63.
    - 74 + 63 = 137
    - 74 - 63 = 11. Bingo!
    So, (81 - 7) - 63 = 74 - 63 = 11.
    Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 81 (yes), 7 (yes), 63 (yes).
    Let's check if only allowed operations are used: subtraction (yes).
    This equation works: (81 - 7) - 63 = 11.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

- 81 - 63 = 18. Now use 7.
    - 18 + 7 = 25
    - 18 - 7 = 11. Bingo again!
    So, (81 - 63) - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11.
    Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 81 (yes), 63 (yes), 7 (yes).
    Let's check if only allowed operations are used: subtraction (yes).
    This equation also works: (81 - 63) - 7 = 11.

- 63 - 81 = -18. Now use 7.
    - -18 + 7 = -11 (Close, but not 11)
    - -18 - 7 = -25

- 63 - 7 = 56. Now use 81.
    - 56 + 81 = 137
    - 56 - 81 = -25
    - 81 - 56 = 25

- 7 - 81 = -74. Now use 63.
    - -74 + 63 = -11 (Close, but not 11)
    - -74 - 63 = -137

- 7 - 63 = -56. Now use 81.
    - -56 + 81 = 25
    - -56 - 81 = -137

Let's try combinations involving division that might result in integers or numbers that can be combined to 11.
We already saw 63 / 7 = 9.
What if we use 81 in a division?
- 81 / ?
    - 81 / (something made from 7 and 63)
    - 81 / (7+63) = 81 / 70 (Not integer)
    - 81 / (63-7) = 81 / 56 (Not integer)
    - 81 / (7*63) = Very small fraction
    - 81 / (63/7) = 81 / 9 = 9. We already explored this.

What if we use 7 in a division?
- 7 / ?
    - 7 / (something made from 81 and 63)
    - 7 / (81+63) = 7 / 144 (Fraction)
    - 7 / (81-63) = 7 / 18 (Fraction)
    - 7 / (63-81) = 7 / -18 (Fraction)
    - 7 / (81*63) = Very small fraction
    - 7 / (81/63) = 7 * (63/81) = 7 * (7/9) = 49/9 (Fraction)
    - 7 / (63/81) = 7 * (81/63) = 7 * (9/7) = 9. Now use 81.
        - 9 + 81 = 90
        - 9 - 81 = -72
        - 81 - 9 = 72
        - 9 * 81 = 729
        - 81 / 9 = 9

What if we use 63 in a division?
- 63 / ?
    - 63 / (something made from 81 and 7)
    - 63 / (81+7) = 63 / 88 (Fraction)
    - 63 / (81-7) = 63 / 74 (Fraction)
    - 63 / (7-81) = 63 / -74 (Fraction)
    - 63 / (81*7) = 63 / 567 = 1/9 (Fraction)
    - 63 / (81/7) = 63 * (7/81) = (7*9) * (7/(9*9)) = 7*7/9 = 49/9 (Fraction)
    - 63 / (7/81) = 63 * (81/7) = (9*7) * (81/7) = 9 * 81 = 729

Let's revisit the successful subtractions.

Both are valid. The user asked for ""a mathematical equation"". I can present either.

Let's list the numbers: [67, 50, 40, 48]
Target: 87

I need to try different combinations and operations.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust.
2. Try to get close to 87 with two numbers and then use the others.
3. Consider division carefully, as it can lead to non-integers.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(67 + 50) - 40 - 48 = 117 - 40 - 48 = 77 - 48 = 29 (Too low)
(67 + 50) - (40 + 48) = 117 - 88 = 29 (Too low)

Attempt 2:
(67 - 50) + 40 + 48 = 17 + 40 + 48 = 57 + 48 = 105 (Too high)

Attempt 3:
(67 + 40) - 50 + 48 = 107 - 50 + 48 = 57 + 48 = 105 (Too high)

Attempt 4:
(67 + 48) - 50 - 40 = 115 - 50 - 40 = 65 - 40 = 25 (Too low)

Attempt 5:
Let's try multiplication.
Maybe 40 * 2? But I don't have 2.
Maybe I can create a number close to 87.
67 + ? = 87 -> ? = 20. Can I make 20 from 50, 40, 48?
50 - 40 + 48 = 10 + 48 = 58 (No)
50 + 40 - 48 = 90 - 48 = 42 (No)
48 - 40 + 50 = 8 + 50 = 58 (No)

Let's try to get a number slightly higher than 87 and subtract.
67 + 50 = 117. Need to subtract 30. Can I make 30 from 40 and 48?
48 - 40 = 8 (No)
40 - 48 (negative)

Let's try to get a number slightly lower than 87 and add.
67 + 40 = 107. Need to subtract 20. Can I make 20 from 50 and 48?
50 - 48 = 2 (No)

Let's try using 48 and 40.
48 + 40 = 88. Close to 87.
So, (48 + 40) - 67 + 50 = 88 - 67 + 50 = 21 + 50 = 71 (No)
(48 + 40) + 67 - 50 = 88 + 67 - 50 = 155 - 50 = 105 (No)

What if I use division to create a smaller number?
50 / ?
40 / ?

Let's try to make 87 directly.
Maybe 48 * 2? No 2.
Maybe 40 * 2? No 2.

Let's try combining 67 with something.

Let's try combining 50 with something.
50 + (something from 67, 40, 48) = 87
something = 37.

Let's try combining 40 with something.
40 + (something from 67, 50, 48) = 87
something = 47.
Can I make 47 from 67, 50, 48?

Let's try combining 48 with something.
48 + (something from 67, 50, 40) = 87
something = 39.
Can I make 39 from 67, 50, 40?
67 - 50 + 40 = 17 + 40 = 57
67 + 50 - 40 = 117 - 40 = 77
50 - 40 + 67 = 10 + 67 = 77
50 + 40 - 67 = 90 - 67 = 23

Let's try subtraction from a larger number.
(67 + 50 + 40) - 48 = 157 - 48 = 109
(67 + 50 + 48) - 40 = 165 - 40 = 125
(67 + 40 + 48) - 50 = 155 - 50 = 105
(50 + 40 + 48) - 67 = 138 - 67 = 71

Let's try multiplication again.
Maybe one of the numbers is a multiplier.
If 40 is a multiplier: 40 * (something from 67, 50, 48)
40 * (67/50) - not integer
40 * (50/67) - not integer
40 * (48/67) - not integer

What if I try to make a number that divides nicely?
For example, can I make 3?
(50-40)/? = 10/?
(48-?) / ?

Let's look at the target 87. It's 3 * 29.
Can I make 3 and 29?
Make 3:
(50-40)/? = 10/?
(48-?) / ?
(67-?) / ?
(50-48)/? = 2/?
(40-?) / ?

Let's try to make 29.
67 - 40 + 50 - 48 = 27 + 2 = 29.
So, (67 - 40 + 50 - 48) = 29.
Now I need to use the remaining number, which is 48.
This doesn't work as I've used all numbers to make 29.

Let's try to make 3.

The target number is 34.
The available numbers are [13, 51, 30].
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with 51:**
    *   51 - 13 = 38. Then use 30. 38 - 30 = 8 (not 34). 38 + 30 = 68 (not 34). 38 * 30 = 1140 (not 34). 38 / 30 (not an integer).
    *   51 - 30 = 21. Then use 13. 21 + 13 = 34. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 51, 30, 13. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +.
Result: 51 - 30 + 13 = 21 + 13 = 34.

This seems to be the solution.

Let's try other starting points just to be sure or to explore alternatives.

2.  **Start with 13:**
    *   13 + 51 = 64. Then use 30. 64 - 30 = 34. This also works!
    *   Numbers used: 13, 51, 30. All used exactly once.
    *   Operations used: +, -.
    *   Result: 13 + 51 - 30 = 64 - 30 = 34.

    *   13 - 51 = -38. Then use 30. -38 + 30 = -8. -38 - 30 = -68. -38 * 30 = -1140. -38 / 30 (not integer).
    *   13 * 51 = 663. Then use 30. 663 - 30 = 633. 663 + 30 = 693. 663 / 30 (not integer).
    *   13 / 51 (not integer).

3.  **Start with 30:**
    *   30 + 13 = 43. Then use 51. 43 - 51 = -8. 43 + 51 = 94. 43 * 51 = 2193. 43 / 51 (not integer).
    *   30 - 13 = 17. Then use 51. 17 + 51 = 68. 17 - 51 = -34. 17 * 51 = 867. 17 / 51 (not integer).
    *   30 * 13 = 390. Then use 51. 390 - 51 = 339. 390 + 51 = 441. 390 / 51 (not integer).
    *   30 / 13 (not integer).
    *   30 + 51 = 81. Then use 13. 81 - 13 = 68. 81 + 13 = 94. 81 * 13 = 1053. 81 / 13 (not integer).
    *   30 - 51 = -21. Then use 13. -21 + 13 = -8. -21 - 13 = -34. -21 * 13 = -273. -21 / 13 (not integer).
    *   30 * 51 = 1530. Then use 13. 1530 - 13 = 1517. 1530 + 13 = 1543. 1530 / 13 (not integer).
    *   30 / 51 (not integer).

We found two valid solutions:
1.  51 - 30 + 13 = 34
2.  13 + 51 - 30 = 34

Both are correct. I will pick one. The order of operations matters if parentheses were involved, but here it's just addition and subtraction, so the order of evaluation from left to right is fine.

Let's present the first one found.
Equation: 51 - 30 + 13
Check: 51 - 30 = 21. 21 + 13 = 34.

The user wants a single mathematical expression using the numbers 26, 12, 97, and 6 exactly once.
The expression must evaluate to 65.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: [26, 12, 97, 6]
Target value: 65

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to get 65.
I will try different groupings and orderings.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest number (97) and see if I can adjust it using the others.
2. Try to create intermediate values that are close to 65 or can easily lead to 65.
3. Consider the parity of the numbers and the target.

Let's try starting with 97.
Target is 65. So, I need to subtract approximately 97 - 65 = 32.
Can I make 32 from [26, 12, 6]?
- 26 + 12 = 38 (too high)
- 26 + 6 = 32. This looks promising!
So, if I can do 97 - (26 + 6), that would be 97 - 32 = 65.
The numbers used are 97, 26, and 6. The number 12 is left unused. This combination doesn't work.

Let's try another way to make 32 from [26, 12, 6].
- 26 - 12 = 14
- 26 - 6 = 20
- 12 + 6 = 18
- 12 * 6 = 72
- 26 * 12 = 312
- 26 * 6 = 156
- 12 / 6 = 2
- 26 / 12 (not integer)
- 26 / 6 (not integer)

What if I try to make a number that, when combined with 97, gives 65?
- 97 + x = 65 => x = 65 - 97 = -32. Can I make -32 from [26, 12, 6]? No, not directly with positive numbers and basic ops.
- 97 * x = 65 => x = 65/97 (not integer)
- 97 / x = 65 => x = 97/65 (not integer)

Let's try combining other numbers first.
Numbers: [26, 12, 97, 6] Target: 65

Try combining 26 and 12.
- 26 + 12 = 38. Remaining: [97, 6]. Can I get 65 from 38, 97, 6?
    - 38 + 97 = 135. Need to subtract 135 - 65 = 70. Can I make 70 from 6? No.
    - 38 - 97 = -59.
    - 97 - 38 = 59. Need to add 65 - 59 = 6. I have 6!
    So, (97 - (26 + 12)) + 6 = (97 - 38) + 6 = 59 + 6 = 65.
    Numbers used: 97, 26, 12, 6. All used exactly once.
    Operations used: -, +, +. This is a valid expression.
    Let's write it out clearly: 97 - (26 + 12) + 6.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

Try combining 26 and 6.

2691,1288,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 72, 8, 64, and 17 exactly once, with only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value of 90.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: [72, 8, 64, 17]
Target: 90

I need to explore combinations. I'll start by looking at the larger numbers and how they might interact to get close to 90.

1.  **Consider 72 and 64:**
    *   72 + 64 = 136 (Too high)
    *   72 - 64 = 8 (Small)
    *   64 - 72 = -8 (Small)
    *   72 * 64 (Very large)
    *   72 / 64 (Fraction)
    *   64 / 72 (Fraction)

2.  **Consider 72 and 8:**
    *   72 + 8 = 80 (Close to 90)
    *   72 - 8 = 64
    *   8 - 72 = -64
    *   72 * 8 (Large)
    *   72 / 8 = 9 (Interesting, small number)
    *   8 / 72 (Fraction)

3.  **Consider 64 and 8:**
    *   64 + 8 = 72
    *   64 - 8 = 56
    *   8 - 64 = -56
    *   64 * 8 (Large)
    *   64 / 8 = 8 (Interesting, small number)
    *   8 / 64 (Fraction)

Let's focus on the combination that got us close: 72 + 8 = 80.
The remaining numbers are 64 and 17.
We need to get from 80 to 90 using 64 and 17. This means we need to add 10.
Can we make 10 from 64 and 17?
*   64 + 17 = 81
*   64 - 17 = 47
*   17 - 64 = -47
*   64 * 17 (Large)
*   64 / 17 (Fraction)
*   17 / 64 (Fraction)
No, we can't make 10 directly.

Let's try another approach. What if we use division to get smaller numbers?
We saw 72 / 8 = 9.
Remaining numbers: 64, 17.
We need to get from 9 to 90 using 64 and 17. This means we need to add 81.
Can we make 81 from 64 and 17?
*   64 + 17 = 81. Yes!

So, the combination could be (72 / 8) + 64 + 17.
Let's check:
(72 / 8) = 9
9 + 64 = 73
73 + 17 = 90.

This uses all numbers (72, 8, 64, 17) exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's try another path to be sure.
What about 64 / 8 = 8?
Remaining numbers: 72, 17.
We need to get from 8 to 90 using 72 and 17. This means we need to add 82.
Can we make 82 from 72 and 17?
*   72 + 17 = 89 (Close, but not 82)
*   72 - 17 = 55
*   17 - 72 = -55
*   72 * 17 (Large)
*   72 / 17 (Fraction)
*   17 / 72 (Fraction)
No, this path doesn't seem to work easily.

Let's re-evaluate the 72 + 8 = 80 path.
We needed to add 10 using 64 and 17. We couldn't make 10 directly.
What if we subtract something from 80? We need to get to 90, so we must add.

Let's consider multiplication.
Can we multiply two numbers to get close to 90?
*   8 * 17 = 136 (Too high)
*   8 * 64 (Too high)
*   17 * 64 (Too high)
*   72 * 8 (Too high)
*   72 * 17 (Too high)
*   72 * 64 (Too high)

What if we multiply a result?
Let's go back to 72 / 8 = 9.
Remaining: 64, 17. Target: 90.
We found (72 / 8) + 64 + 17 = 9 + 64 + 17 = 90. This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there are other ways.
What if we use subtraction in a different way?
Suppose we have a larger number and subtract something.
Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 90 and subtract.
Example: 100 - 10 = 90.
Can we make 100 and 10 from the numbers?
Numbers: [72, 8, 64, 17]

Let's try to make 100.
*   72 + 17 + 8 + 64 = 161 (Too high)
*   72 + 17 + 8 = 97 (Close)
*   72 + 17 + 64 = 153
*   72 + 8 + 64 = 144
*   17 + 8 + 64 = 89 (Close)

Let's try to make 10.
*   17 - 8 = 9 (Close)
*   64 / 8 = 8 (Close)
*   72 / 8 = 9 (Close)

Let's reconsider the 72 / 8 = 9 path.
We need to add 81 using 64 and 17.
64 + 17 = 81.
So, (72 / 8) + 64 + 17 = 9 + 64 + 17 = 90. This is confirmed.

Let's try another structure.
What if we group operations?
Example: (A op B) op (C op D)
Numbers: [72, 8, 64, 17]

Try (72 + 8) + (64 - 17) = 80 + 47 = 127 (No)
Try (72 - 8) + (64 + 17) = 64 + 81 = 145 (No)
Try (72 / 8) + (64 + 17) = 9 + 81 = 90. This is the same solution found earlier, just written with parentheses.

Let's try another grouping.
(72 + 64) - (17 + 8) = 136 - 25 = 111 (No)
(72 - 64) + (17 + 8) = 8 + 25 = 33 (No)
(64 - 17) + (72 - 8) = 47 + 64 = 111 (No)

What about multiplication as the last step?
We need to get a factor of 90. Factors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.
Can we make one of these factors and multiply it by something else?

Let's try to make 10.
We saw 17 - 8 = 9. Not 10.
We saw 64 / 8 = 8. Not 10.
We saw 72 / 8 = 9. Not 10.

What if we try to make 9?
72 / 8 = 9. Remaining: 64, 17. We need to multiply 9 by something to get 90. That something is 10. Can we make 10 from 64 and 17? No",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants me to find a mathematical equation using the numbers 48, 56, 91, and 21 to reach the target number 78.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [48, 56, 91, 21]
Target: 78

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.

Let's try some combinations.
Maybe start with the larger numbers.
91 and 56.
91 - 56 = 35. Remaining numbers are 48, 21. 35 + 48 + 21 = 104. Too high.
91 + 56 = 147. Remaining numbers are 48, 21. 147 - 48 - 21 = 78. This works!

Let's check the numbers used: 91, 56, 48, 21. All used exactly once.
Let's check the operations: +, -, -. All allowed.
Let's check the result: 147 - 48 - 21 = 99 - 21 = 78. Correct.

So the equation is 91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 78.

Let's try another order to be sure.
(91 + 56) - (48 + 21) = 147 - 69 = 78. This also works and uses the same numbers and operations.
The user asked for ""an equation"", so the first one is fine.

Let's try other starting points just to explore.
What if I use multiplication?
48 * 21 is too large.
56 * 21 is too large.
91 * 21 is too large.
48 * 56 is too large.

What about division?
91 / 21 is not an integer.
56 / 21 is not an integer.
48 / 21 is not an integer.
91 / 48 is not an integer.
56 / 48 is not an integer.
21 / 48 is not an integer.
21 / 56 is not an integer.
21 / 91 is not an integer.
48 / 56 is not an integer.
48 / 91 is not an integer.
56 / 91 is not an integer.

So division is unlikely to be the first operation unless it results in an integer.
Let's check if any pair divides nicely.
48 / ?
56 / ?
91 / ?
21 / ?

Maybe division comes later.
Let's go back to the successful combination: 91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 78.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to structure it differently.
Maybe (91 - 48) + (56 - 21) = 43 + 35 = 78.
Numbers used: 91, 48, 56, 21. All used once.
Operations: -, +, -. All allowed.
Result: 43 + 35 = 78. Correct.

This is also a valid solution. The user asked for ""an equation"". I can present either.
I'll present the first one I found as it's simpler in terms of parenthesis.
91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 78.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Numbers: [48 56 91 21] - used.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - used +, -.
- Each number used precisely one time - checked.
- Result: 78 - achieved.
- Output format: <answer></answer> tags.

The equation 91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 78 fits all criteria.
Another option: (91 - 48) + (56 - 21) = 78.
Another option: 56 + 91 - 48 - 21 = 78.
Another option: 56 + 91 - (48 + 21) = 78.

I will use the first one found: 91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 78.
It's straightforward.

The user wants me to find an arithmetic equation using the numbers 18, 26, 10, and 9 exactly once, with the result being 71. I can only use the basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

I need to explore different combinations and orders of operations.

Let's list the numbers: [18, 26, 10, 9]
Target: 71

Possible strategies:
1. Try combining the largest numbers first.
2. Try multiplication to get closer to the target quickly.
3. Consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(26 * ?) + ? + ?
(26 * 10) = 260 (too big)
(26 * 9) = 234 (too big)
(26 * 18) = 468 (too big)

Attempt 2:
(18 * ?) + ? + ?
(18 * 10) = 180 (too big)
(18 * 9) = 162 (too big)
(18 * 26) = 468 (too big)

Attempt 3:
(10 * ?) + ? + ?
(10 * 18) = 180 (too big)
(10 * 26) = 260 (too big)
(10 * 9) = 90. Remaining numbers are [18, 26]. 90 + 18 + 26 = 134 (too big). 90 + 18 - 26 = 82. 90 - 18 + 26 = 98. 90 - 18 - 26 = 46.

Attempt 4:
(9 * ?) + ? + ?
(9 * 18) = 162 (too big)
(9 * 26) = 234 (too big)
(9 * 10) = 90. Remaining numbers are [18, 26]. Same as above.

Let's try division.
Maybe a division results in a smaller number that can be used.
18 / 9 = 2. Remaining numbers [26, 10]. 2 + 26 + 10 = 38. 2 * 26 + 10 = 52 + 10 = 62. 2 * 10 + 26 = 20 + 26 = 46.
26 / ? (not easily divisible by 18, 10, 9)
10 / ? (not easily divisible by 18, 26, 9)
9 / ? (not easily divisible by 18, 26, 10)

Let's try combining two numbers first, then operating with the others.

Try multiplication with one of the smaller numbers.
(10 + 9) = 19. Remaining [18, 26]. 19 * ? No. 19 + 18 + 26 = 63. 19 + 26 - 18 = 27. 19 + 18 - 26 = 11.
(10 - 9) = 1. Remaining [18, 26]. 1 * 18 + 26 = 44. 1 * 26 + 18 = 44. 1 + 18 + 26 = 45.
(10 * 9) = 90. Remaining [18, 26]. 90 - 18 - 26 = 46. 90 - 26 + 18 = 82. 90 + 18 - 26 = 82. 90 + 26 - 18 = 98.

(18 + 9) = 27. Remaining [10, 26]. 27 + 10 + 26 = 63. 27 * ? No.
(18 - 9) = 9. Remaining [10, 26]. 9 + 10 + 26 = 45. 9 * 10 - 26 = 90 - 26 = 64. 9 * 26 - 10 = 234 - 10 = 224.
(18 * 9) = 162. Remaining [10, 26]. Too big.
(18 / 9) = 2. Remaining [10, 26]. 2 * 10 + 26 = 46. 2 * 26 + 10 = 62. 2 + 10 + 26 = 38.

(26 + 9) = 35. Remaining [10, 18]. 35 + 10 + 18 = 63. 35 * ? No.
(26 - 9) = 17. Remaining [10, 18]. 17 + 10 + 18 = 45. 17 * ? No.
(26 * 9) = 234. Remaining [10, 18]. Too big.

(26 + 10) = 36. Remaining [9, 18]. 36 + 9 + 18 = 63. 36 * ? No.
(26 - 10) = 16. Remaining [9, 18]. 16 + 9 + 18 = 43. 16 * ? No.
(26 * 10) = 260. Remaining [9, 18]. Too big.

(18 + 10) = 28. Remaining [9, 26]. 28 + 9 + 26 = 63. 28 * ? No.
(18 - 10) = 8. Remaining [9, 26]. 8 + 9 + 26 = 43. 8 * 9 + 26 = 72 + 26 = 98. 8 * 26 + 9 = 208 + 9 = 217.
(18 * 10) = 180. Remaining [9, 26]. Too big.

Let's try a structure like A * B + C + D or A * B - C - D.
We need to get to 71.
If we multiply two numbers, the result should be somewhat close to 71 or a number that, when combined with the others, gets to 71.

Consider 10 * 9 = 90. We need to subtract 19. We have 18 and 26. 26 - 18 = 8. 18 - 26 = -8. So 90 - (26 - 18) = 90 - 8 = 82. 90 - (18 - 26) = 90 - (-8) = 98.
What about 90 - 18 - 26 = 46.
What about 90 - 26 + 18 = 82.

Consider 18 * ?
18 * 2 = 36 (using 18/9). Remaining [10, 26]. 36 + 10 + 26 = 72. Close!
Let's check: (18 / 9) * 10 + 26 = 2 * 10 + 26 = 20 + 26 = 46. Incorrect.
Let's check: (18 / 9) * 26 + 10 = 2 * 26 + 10 = 52 + 10 = 62. Incorrect.
Let's check: (18 / 9) + 10 + 26 = 2 + 10 + 26 = 38. Incorrect.

Let's try multiplication with one of the larger numbers and a smaller number.
26 * 3 = 78 (using 9/3 or 18/6, not possible directly).
26 * 2 = 52 (using 18/9). Remaining [10, 9]. 52 + 10 + 9 = 71.
This looks promising!
The numbers used are 26, 18, 9, 10.
The operations are multiplication, division, addition.

1576,1048,"<think>The target number is 58. The given numbers are 85, 30, and 3. I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's explore combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 85.
How can I get from 85 to 58 using 30 and 3?
85 - ? = 58. The difference is 85 - 58 = 27.
Can I make 27 from 30 and 3?
30 - 3 = 27. This works!
So, the equation would be 85 - (30 - 3) = 58.
Let's check: 85 - 27 = 58. This is correct.
The numbers used are 85, 30, and 3, each exactly once. The operations are subtraction.

Let's try other combinations to be sure.

Possibility 2: Multiplication.
Can I multiply any of these numbers to get close to 58?
85 * 30 is too large.
85 * 3 is too large.
30 * 3 = 90.
If I have 90, how can I use 85 to get 58?
90 - 85 = 5. Not 58.
85 - 90 = -5. Not 58.
90 + 85 is too large.
85 / 90 is a fraction.

Possibility 3: Division.
85 / 30 is a fraction.
85 / 3 is a fraction.
30 / 3 = 10.
If I have 10, how can I use 85 to get 58?
85 - 10 = 75. Not 58.
10 - 85 = -75. Not 58.
85 + 10 = 95. Not 58.
10 * 85 is too large.

Possibility 4: Another order for subtraction.
(85 - 30) - 3 = 55 - 3 = 52. Not 58.
(30 - 85) - 3 = -55 - 3 = -58. Not 58.
(30 - 3) - 85 = 27 - 85 = -58. Not 58.
(3 - 30) - 85 = -27 - 85 = -112. Not 58.
(85 - 3) - 30 = 82 - 30 = 52. Not 58.
(3 - 85) - 30 = -82 - 30 = -112. Not 58.

Possibility 5: Addition and subtraction.
85 + 30 + 3 = 118.
85 + 30 - 3 = 112.
85 - 30 + 3 = 55 + 3 = 58. This also works!
Let's check: 85 - 30 + 3 = 55 + 3 = 58.
The numbers used are 85, 30, and 3, each exactly once. The operations are subtraction and addition.

Both 85 - (30 - 3) and 85 - 30 + 3 result in 58. The prompt asks for ""a specific numerical expression"". I will present the simpler one without parentheses.

Let's re-verify the first one: 85 - (30 - 3) = 85 - 27 = 58. This is valid.
Let's re-verify the second one: 85 - 30 + 3 = 55 + 3 = 58. This is also valid.

The prompt does not specify order of operations preference if multiple exist. I will choose the one that reads more directly.

Consider 85 - 30 + 3. This uses 85, 30, 3, and the operations - and +. Each number is used once. The result is 58.

Consider 85 - (30 - 3). This uses 85, 30, 3, and the operations - and -. Each number is used once. The result is 58.

Both are valid. I will present 85 - 30 + 3 as it's slightly more direct without needing parentheses.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 96.
How can I get from 96 to 80 using 16, 34, 34?
96 - 16 = 80. This uses 96 and 16. I still have 34 and 34 left. I need to incorporate them in a way that doesn't change the result of 80.
This means I need to add or subtract zero, or multiply or divide by one.
Can I make 0 from 34 and 34? Yes, 34 - 34 = 0.
So, the equation could be (96 - 16) + (34 - 34) = 80.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 96, 16, 34, 34. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, +, -. Yes.
Let's check the result: (80) + (0) = 80. Yes.

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there are simpler ones.

Possibility 2: Try multiplication.
Maybe 16 * 5 = 80? Can I make 5 from 34, 34, 96?
(96 / 34) is not an integer.
(34 / 34) = 1. Then I have 96 and 1. Can't make 5.
(34 + 34) = 68. Then I have 96 and 68. Can't make 5.
(34 - 34) = 0. Then I have 96 and 0. Can't make 5.
(34 * 34) = 1156. Then I have 96 and 1156. Can't make 5.

Possibility 3: Try division.
Maybe 160 / 2 = 80? Can I make 160 and 2 from the numbers?
Can I make 160 from 16, 34, 34, 96?
16 * 10 = 160. Can I make 10 from 34, 34, 96? No obvious way.
96 + 34 + 34 = 164. Close.
96 + 34 - 34 = 96.
96 * (34/34) = 96.

Possibility 4: Another approach with 96.
96 - ? = 80. The ? must be 16.
We already found (96 - 16) + (34 - 34) = 80.

What if we use 34 and 34 first?
34 + 34 = 68. Remaining: 16, 96. Target: 80.
Can I get 80 from 68, 16, 96?
68 + 16 = 84. Remaining: 96. Need to get from 84 to 80 using 96. 84 - 96 is negative. 96 - 84 = 12.
68 + 96 = 164. Remaining: 16. Need to get from 164 to 80 using 16. 164 - 16 = 148. 164 + 16 = 180.
68 * 16 = 1088.
68 / 16 is not integer.

34 - 34 = 0. Remaining: 16, 96. Target: 80.
0 + 16 + 96 = 112.
0 + 96 - 16 = 80.
So, (34 - 34) + 96 - 16 = 80.
This is essentially the same as the first solution, just reordered. (96 - 16) + (34 - 34) = 80.

34 * 34 = 1156. Remaining: 16, 96. Target: 80.
1156 - 96 - 16 = 1044.
1156 + 16 - 96 = 1076.

34 / 34 = 1. Remaining: 16, 96. Target: 80.
1 + 16 + 96 = 113.
1 + 96 - 16 = 81. Close.
1 * 16 + 96 = 112.
1 * 96 - 16 = 80.
So, (34 / 34) * 96 - 16 = 80.
Let's check: (1) * 96 - 16 = 96 - 16 = 80.
Numbers used: 34, 34, 96, 16. All used exactly once.
Operations: /, *, -. All basic.
Result: 80.

This is another valid solution. (34 / 34) * 96 - 16 = 80.

Let's try starting with 16.
16 * ? = 80. ? = 5. Can we make 5 from 34, 34, 96? No.
16 + ? = 80. ? = 64. Can we make 64 from 34, 34, 96?
34 + 34 = 68. Close. 68 - ? = 64. ? = 4. Can't make 4 from 96.
96 - 34 = 62. Close. 62 + ? = 64. ? = 2. Can't make 2 from 34.
96 / ? = 64. No.

Let's re-evaluate the two solutions found:
1. (96 - 16) + (34 - 34) = 80
2. (34 / 34) * 96 - 16 = 80

Both are valid. The second one might be considered slightly more elegant as it doesn't involve adding zero.

Let's try one more combination.
Maybe use 16 and 34 together first.
16 + 34 = 50. Remaining: 34, 96. Target: 80.
50 + 34 = 84. Remaining: 96. Need to get from 84 to 80 using 96. 84 - 96 is negative. 96 - 84 = 12.
50 + 96 = 146. Remaining: 34. 146 - 34 = 112.
50 * 34 = 1700.
50 * 96 = 4800.

16 * 34 = 544. Remaining: 34, 96. Target: 80.
544 - 96 - 34 = 414.

34 - 16 = 18. Remaining: 34, 96. Target: 80.
18 + 34 = 52. Remaining: 96. 52 + 96 = 148. 96 - 52 = 44.
18 + 96 = 114. Remaining: 34. 114 - 34 = 80.
So, (34 - 16) + 96 - 34 = 80.
Let's check: (18) + 96 - 34 = 114 - 34 = 80.
Numbers used: 34, 16, 96, 34. All used exactly once.
Operations: -, +, -. All basic.
Result: 80.

This is a third valid solution: (34 - 16) + 96 - 34 = 80.

Let's compare the three solutions:
1. (96 - 16) + (3",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4251,619,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers [49, 58, 98, 69] exactly once, along with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 47.

Let's list the numbers: 49, 58, 98, 69.
The target is 47.

We need to combine these four numbers using the four operations. This means we will have three operations in total.

Let's consider the magnitude of the numbers and the target. The numbers are in the range of 49-98. The target is 47, which is slightly smaller than the smallest number. This suggests that subtraction will likely play a significant role, or perhaps division that results in a smaller number.

Let's try some initial combinations and see if we can get close to 47.

Possibility 1: Start with multiplication or division to get larger or smaller numbers.
If we multiply two numbers, the result will be quite large.
49 * 58 = 2842 (too big)
49 * 98 = 4802 (too big)
49 * 69 = 3381 (too big)
58 * 98 = 5684 (too big)
58 * 69 = 4002 (too big)
98 * 69 = 6762 (too big)

Division might be more useful.
98 / 49 = 2. This is a small number. Let's see if we can use this.
Numbers remaining: 58, 69. Operations remaining: +, -, *. Target: 47.
We have 2, 58, 69.
Can we get 47 from 2, 58, 69?
Possible combinations:
2 + 58 + 69 = 129
2 + 58 - 69 = -9
2 - 58 + 69 = 13
2 - 58 - 69 = -125
58 + 69 - 2 = 125
58 - 69 + 2 = -9
69 - 58 + 2 = 13
69 - 58 - 2 = 9
2 * 58 + 69 = 116 + 69 = 185
2 * 58 - 69 = 116 - 69 = 47. This looks promising!
So, we have (98 / 49) * 58 - 69 = 2 * 58 - 69 = 116 - 69 = 47.
This uses all numbers [49, 58, 98, 69] exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's verify the order of operations.
(98 / 49) * 58 - 69
First, the division inside the parenthesis: 98 / 49 = 2.
Then, the multiplication: 2 * 58 = 116.
Finally, the subtraction: 116 - 69 = 47.

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's explore other divisions just to be thorough.
98 / 58 (not an integer)
98 / 69 (not an integer)
69 / 49 (not an integer)
69 / 58 (not an integer)
58 / 49 (not an integer)

What about division resulting in a non-integer that might be useful later?
For example, 49 / 98 = 0.5.
Numbers remaining: 58, 69. Operations remaining: +, -, *. Target: 47.
We have 0.5, 58, 69.
0.5 + 58 + 69 = 127.5
0.5 + 58 - 69 = -10.5
0.5 - 58 + 69 = 11.5
0.5 * 58 + 69 = 29 + 69 = 98
0.5 * 58 - 69 = 29 - 69 = -40
58 * 69 + 0.5 = 4002.5
58 * 69 - 0.5 = 4001.5
This doesn't seem to lead to 47 easily.

Let's consider other structures.
Maybe addition/subtraction first.
49 + 58 = 107. Remaining: 98, 69. Operations: -, *, /. Target: 47.
107, 98, 69.
107 - 98 = 9. Remaining: 69. Operations: *, /. 9, 69. 9*69 or 9/69. Not 47.
107 + 98 = 205. Remaining: 69. Operations: -, *, /.
107 - 69 = 38. Remaining: 98. Operations: -, *, /. 38, 98. 38*98, 38/98, 98/38.
107 + 69 = 176. Remaining: 98. Operations: -, *, /.

Let's try subtraction first.
69 - 49 = 20. Remaining: 58, 98. Operations: +, *, /. Target: 47.
20, 58, 98.
20 + 58 = 78. Remaining: 98. Operations: *, /. 78, 98.
20 - 58 = -38. Remaining: 98. Operations: *, /.
20 * 58 = 1160. Remaining: 98. Operations: +, /.
20 / 58.
58 - 49 = 9. Remaining: 98, 69. Operations: +, *, /. Target: 47.
9, 98, 69.
9 + 98 = 107. Remaining: 69. Operations: *, /.
9 * 98 = 882. Remaining: 69. Operations: +, /.
98 - 49 = 49. Remaining: 58, 69. Operations: +, -, *. Target: 47.
49, 58, 69.
49 + 58 = 107. Remaining: 69. Operations: -, *. 107 - 69 = 38. 107 * 69.
49 - 58 = -9. Remaining: 69. Operations: +, *. -9 + 69 = 60. -9 * 69.
49 * 58 = 2842. Remaining: 69. Operations: +, -.
49 + 69 = 118. Remaining: 58. Operations: -, *. 118 - 58 = 60. 118 * 58.
49 - 69 = -20. Remaining: 58. Operations: +, *. -20 + 58 = 38. -20 * 58.
49 * 69 = 3381. Remaining: 58. Operations: +, -.

Let's go back to the successful path: (98 / 49) * 58 - 69 = 47.
This uses 98, 49, 58, 69.
Operations are /, *, -.
All numbers are used once.
All operations are basic arithmetic.
The result is 47.

Let's consider if there are other ways to group the operations.
For example, could we have 49 / (something)?
49 / (58 - 98 + 69) = 49 / (58 - 29) = 49 / 29 (not integer)
49 / (58 + 98 - 69) = 49 / (156 - 69) = 49 / 87 (not integer)

Could we have (49 * 58) / (something)? This will be very large.

Let's think about the target number 47. It's a prime number.
The numbers are 49, 58, 98, 69.
Notice that 98 = 2 * 49. This was key in the first solution.

Let's try to construct 47 from scratch using the numbers.

Option 1: 62 - 41 - 10 = 11
Option 2: 62 - (41 + 10) = 11

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's try other combinations just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

2.  **Using multiplication first:**
    *   41 * 42 (very large)
    *   41 * 39 (very large)
    *   42 * 39 (very large)

3.  **Using division first (where possible to get integers):**
    *   42 / 41 (not integer)
    *   42 / 39 (not integer)
    *   41 / 42 (not integer)
    *   41 / 39 (not integer)
    *   39 / 41 (not integer)
    *   39 / 42 (not integer)

    This suggests that division is likely to be the last operation or part of a subtraction/addition that results in a number that can be divided.

4.  **Consider other subtractions:**
    *   42 - 39 = 3. Then 3 * 41 = 123 (too high). 3 + 41 = 44 (too high). 41 / 3 (not integer).
    *   41 - 42 = -1. Then -1 * 39 = -39. -1 + 39 = 38. 39 / -1 = -39.
    *   39 - 41 = -2. Then -2 * 42 = -84. -2 + 42 = 40. 42 / -2 = -21. Close, but negative.
    *   39 - 42 = -3. Then -3 * 41 = -123. -3 + 41 = 38. 41 / -3 (not integer).

5.  **Consider other additions:**
    *   41 + 42 = 83. Then 83 - 39 = 44. 83 * 39 (large). 83 / 39 (not integer). 39 / 83 (not integer).
    *   41 + 39 = 80. Then 80 - 42 = 38. 80 * 42 (large). 80 / 42 (not integer). 42 / 80 (not integer).
    *   42 + 39 = 81. Then 81 - 41 = 40. 81 * 41 (large). 81 / 41 (not integer). 41 / 81 (not integer).

The combination 42 / (41 - 39) = 21 seems to be the most straightforward and correct solution.
Let's write it out clearly.
Numbers: 41, 42, 39.
Target: 21.
Operations: +, -, *, /.
Each number used once.

Equation: 42 / (41 - 39)
Step 1: Calculate the expression in parentheses: 41 - 39 = 2.
Step 2: Perform the division: 42 / 2 = 21.
The equation uses 41, 42, and 39 exactly once.
The operations used are subtraction and division.
The result is 21.

This is a valid solution.

3894,298,"<think>The problem requires constructing an equation using the numbers 45, 73, and 95, along with basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 67. Each number must be used exactly once.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operators.

Let's list the numbers: 45, 73, 95.
Target result: 67.

Possible operations:
1. Addition and subtraction:
   - 45 + 73 + 95 = 213 (too high)
   - 45 + 73 - 95 = 118 - 95 = 23 (too low)
   - 45 - 73 + 95 = -28 + 95 = 67 (This works!)
   - 45 - 73 - 95 = -28 - 95 = -123 (too low)
   - 73 + 45 - 95 = 118 - 95 = 23 (same as above)
   - 73 - 45 + 95 = 28 + 95 = 123 (too high)
   - 73 + 95 - 45 = 168 - 45 = 123 (too high)
   - 73 - 95 + 45 = -22 + 45 = 23 (too low)
   - 95 + 45 - 73 = 140 - 73 = 67 (This also works!)
   - 95 - 45 + 73 = 50 + 73 = 123 (too high)
   - 95 + 73 - 45 = 168 - 45 = 123 (same as above)
   - 95 - 73 + 45 = 22 + 45 = 67 (This also works!)

So, I have found three potential solutions using only addition and subtraction:
1. 45 - 73 + 95 = 67
2. 95 + 45 - 73 = 67
3. 95 - 73 + 45 = 67

Let's check if multiplication or division could be involved, though the simple addition/subtraction solutions are already found.

Consider multiplication:
- 45 * 73 = 3285 (too high)
- 45 * 95 = 4275 (too high)
- 73 * 95 = 6935 (too high)

Consider division:
- 45 / 73 (not an integer)
- 45 / 95 (not an integer)
- 73 / 45 (not an integer)
- 73 / 95 (not an integer)
- 95 / 45 (not an integer)
- 95 / 73 (not an integer)

It seems unlikely that multiplication or division will be the primary operations leading to 67, given the large numbers involved. If division were used, it would likely be to reduce a larger number.

Let's re-examine the addition/subtraction solutions. They are valid and meet all criteria. I can pick any one of them.
The simplest to write might be 95 - 73 + 45.

Let's verify the order of operations.
95 - 73 + 45
(95 - 73) + 45 = 22 + 45 = 67. This is correct.

Another one:
45 - 73 + 95
(45 - 73) + 95 = -28 + 95 = 67. This is correct.

Another one:
95 + 45 - 73
(95 + 45) - 73 = 140 - 73 = 67. This is correct.

I will choose one of these. The problem asks for *an* equation.
I'll use 95 - 73 + 45.

Let's list the numbers: [25, 77, 7, 40]

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to 84.

Possible strategies:
1. Try to get a number close to 84 by combining two numbers, then adjust with the others.
2. Look for combinations that might result in multiples of numbers that can be easily adjusted.
3. Consider division carefully, as it can lead to non-integer results if not planned.

I have found three valid equations:

2.  (42 - 21) + 74 = 95
3.  (74 - 21) + 42 = 95

The first one seems the most straightforward. I will present that one.

Derivations:
Start with the numbers 74, 42, and 21. The target is 95.
Try adding the two larger numbers: 74 + 42 = 116.
Now, use the remaining number, 21, to reach the target from 116.
Subtract 21 from 116: 116 - 21 = 95.
This equation uses all numbers (74, 42, 21) exactly once and only allowed operations (+, -).
The equation is (74 + 42) - 21 = 95.

Let's verify the other options as well.
Option 2: (42 - 21) + 74
42 - 21 = 21
21 + 74 = 95
This is also valid.

Option 3: (74 - 21) + 42
74 - 21 = 53
53 + 42 = 95
This is also valid.

I will present the first one found.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Start with multiplication as it often leads to larger numbers quickly.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 64, 66, and 85 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to equal 83.

Let's list the numbers: [64, 66, 85].
The target is 83.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can reach 83.

Possible combinations of two numbers first, then combine with the third.

1.  **Start with 85:**
    *   85 + 64 = 149. 149 ? 66 = 83. 149 - 66 = 83. This works!
        *   Equation: 85 + 64 - 66 = 83.
        *   Check: 85 + 64 = 149. 149 - 66 = 83. This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, although I've already found one.

2.  **Start with 85 and 66:**
    *   85 - 66 = 19. 19 ? 64 = 83. 19 + 64 = 83. This also works!
        *   Equation: 85 - 66 + 64 = 83.
        *   Check: 85 - 66 = 19. 19 + 64 = 83. This is also a valid solution.

    *   85 * 66 = 5610. 5610 ? 64 = 83. Unlikely.
    *   85 / 66 = ~1.28. 1.28 ? 64 = 83. Unlikely.

3.  **Start with 64 and 66:**
    *   64 + 66 = 130. 130 ? 85 = 83. 130 - 85 = 45. No.
    *   66 - 64 = 2. 2 ? 85 = 83. 85 - 2 = 83. This works!
        *   Equation: 85 - (66 - 64) = 83.
        *   Check: 66 - 64 = 2. 85 - 2 = 83. This is a valid solution.

    *   64 - 66 = -2. -2 ? 85 = 83. -2 + 85 = 83. This works!
        *   Equation: (64 - 66) + 85 = 83.
        *   Check: 64 - 66 = -2. -2 + 85 = 83. This is a valid solution.

    *   66 / 64 = ~1.03. 1.03 ? 85 = 83. Unlikely.

I have found multiple valid solutions. The simplest ones are usually preferred in puzzle contexts.

85 - 66 + 64 = 83
85 - (66 - 64) = 83
(64 - 66) + 85 = 83

I will pick one of the straightforward ones. 85 + 64 - 66 = 83 seems very direct.
Let's double check the constraints:
- Use numbers [64, 66, 85] exactly once: Yes.
- Use only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /): Yes.
- Equation must precisely equal 83: Yes.

The equation 85 + 64 - 66 = 83 satisfies all conditions.

1856,1671,"<think>The problem asks us to find an equation using the numbers 23, 42, and 39 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, and /, to achieve a result of 69.

Let's list the numbers: {23, 42, 39}.
The target is 69.

We need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. There are several possible permutations of the numbers and combinations of operations.

Let's try to combine two numbers first and then incorporate the third.

Possibility 1: Start with multiplication.
*   23 * 42 = 966 (Too large)
*   23 * 39 = 897 (Too large)
*   42 * 39 = 1638 (Too large)

Possibility 2: Start with division.
*   42 / 23 (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 69 easily)
*   39 / 23 (Not an integer)
*   42 / 39 (Not an integer)
*   23 / 42 (Not an integer)
*   23 / 39 (Not an integer)
*   39 / 42 (Not an integer)
Division is less likely to be the primary operation unless it simplifies nicely or is part of a larger expression that cancels out fractions.

Possibility 3: Start with addition or subtraction.
Let's try combining two numbers and then operating with the third.

Consider the target number 69. It's a relatively small number compared to the products of the given numbers. This suggests that subtraction or division might be important, or perhaps a combination that reduces large intermediate results.

Let's try to get close to 69.
*   42 + 23 = 65. We need +4. Can we get 4 from 39? No, not directly.
*   42 - 23 = 19. We need +50. Can we get 50 from 39? No.
*   23 - 42 = -19. We need +88.
*   39 + 23 = 62. We need +7. Can we get 7 from 42? No.
*   39 - 23 = 16. We need +53.
*   23 - 39 = -16. We need +85.
*   42 + 39 = 81. We need -12. Can we get 12 from 23? No.
*   42 - 39 = 3. We need +66. Can we get 66 from 23? No.
*   39 - 42 = -3. We need +72.

Let's consider operations involving all three numbers.
We have numbers {23, 42, 39} and target 69.

Let's try to use multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract.
If we multiply two numbers, say 23 * 3 = 69. Can we get 3 from 42 and 39? Yes, 42 - 39 = 3.
So, let's try: 23 * (42 - 39).
Let's check this:
23 * (42 - 39) = 23 * 3 = 69.
This uses 23, 42, and 39 exactly once.
It uses multiplication and subtraction.
The result is exactly 69.

Let's verify if there are other possibilities, just to be thorough.

What if we try to get 69 by adding/subtracting from a product?
*   (23 * 42) - X = 69 => 966 - X = 69 => X = 966 - 69 = 897. Can we get 897 from 39? No.
*   (23 * 39) - X = 69 => 897 - X = 69 => X = 897 - 69 = 828. Can we get 828 from 42? No.
*   (42 * 39) - X = 69 => 1638 - X = 69 => X = 1638 - 69 = 1569. Can we get 1569 from 23? No.

What if we add to a product?
*   (23 * 42) + X = 69 => 966 + X = 69 => X = 69 - 966 = -897.
*   (23 * 39) + X = 69 => 897 + X = 69 => X = 69 - 897 = -828.
*   (42 * 39) + X = 69 => 1638 + X = 69 => X = 69 - 1638 = -1569.

What about division?
Let's try to get 69 as a result of division.
X / Y = 69.
If Y = 1, X = 69. Can we get 1 from two numbers and 69 from the third?
If Y = 2, X = 138.
If Y = 3, X = 207.

Let's consider the expression (42 - 39) = 3.
We have 23 and 3. We need 69. 23 * 3 = 69. This works.

Let's try another structure.
(A + B) * C = 69
(23 + 42) * 39 = 65 * 39 (Too large)
(23 + 39) * 42 = 62 * 42 (Too large)
(42 + 39) * 23 = 81 * 23 (Too large)

(A - B) * C = 69
(42 - 23) * 39 = 19 * 39 (Too large)
(39 - 23) * 42 = 16 * 42 (Too large)
(42 - 39) * 23 = 3 * 23 = 69. This is the solution we found.

(23 - 42) * 39 = -19 * 39 (Negative)
(23 - 39) * 42 = -16 * 42 (Negative)
(39 - 42) * 23 = -3 * 23 (Negative)

The target number is 83.
The given numbers are 67, 86, and 70.
I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 86.
86 - ? = 83. This would require 3. Can I make 3 from 67 and 70?
70 - 67 = 3.
So, 86 - (70 - 67) = 86 - 3 = 83.
This uses all numbers (86, 70, 67) exactly once and the operations -, -.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough.

Possibility 2: Start with 70.
70 + ? = 83. This would require 13. Can I make 13 from 67 and 86?
86 - 67 = 19. Not 13.
67 - 86 is negative.
86 / 67 is not an integer.
67 / 86 is not an integer.
67 * 86 is too large.

Possibility 3: Start with 67.
67 + ? = 83. This would require 16. Can I make 16 from 86 and 70?
86 - 70 = 16.
So, 67 + (86 - 70) = 67 + 16 = 83.
This also uses all numbers (67, 86, 70) exactly once and the operations +, -.
This is another valid solution.

Possibility 4: Try multiplication or division.
If I multiply two numbers, the result will be quite large.
67 * 86 = 5762
67 * 70 = 4690
86 * 70 = 6020
These are all much larger than 83, so I'd need to subtract a lot.
Let's try 86 * 70 / ?
86 * 70 = 6020.
6020 / 67 is not an integer.

Let's try division first.
86 / 67 is not integer.
86 / 70 is not integer.
70 / 67 is not integer.
70 / 86 is not integer.
67 / 86 is not integer.
67 / 70 is not integer.

So, it seems the solutions will involve addition and subtraction.
I found two valid solutions:
1. 86 - (70 - 67) = 83
2. 67 + (86 - 70) = 83

Let's try different combinations:

    *   49 * 2 = 98. Then we need to get 97 from 98 and 24.
        *   98 - 24 = 74 (Not 97)

    *   49 * 24 = 1176. This is too large to easily get to 97 with just 2.
    *   24 * 2 = 48. Then we need to get 97 from 48 and 49.

This uses 24, 2, and 49 exactly once and results in 97.

        *   73 * 2 = 146 (Not 97)

        *   49 / 26 (Not integer)
    *   24 - 2 = 22. Need to get 97 from 22 and 49.
        *   22 + 49 = 71 (Not 97)
        *   22 - 49 = -27 (Not 97)

        *   -22 - 49 = -71 (Not 97)
        *   49 - (-22) = 71 (Not 97)

3.  **Consider division first (less likely to yield integer results easily):**
    *   49 / 2 (Not integer)
    *   24 / 2 = 12. Need to get 97 from 12 and 49.
        *   12 + 49 = 61 (Not 97)
        *   12 - 49 = -37 (Not 97)

    *   2 / 49 (Not integer)
    *   2 / 24 (Not integer)
    *   49 / 24 (Not integer)

The combination (24 * 2) + 49 = 97 is the most straightforward and correct solution.
The order of operations matters, so parentheses are important.
(24 * 2) + 49 = 48 + 49 = 97.
Alternatively, 49 + (24 * 2) = 49 + 48 = 97.
Or even 49 + 2 * 24 = 49 + 48 = 97 (due to order of operations).
The prompt asks for ""an equation"", so any valid one is fine. I'll use the one with explicit parentheses for clarity.

Let's check if 49 * 2 - 24 works.
49 * 2 = 98
98 - 24 = 74. No.

Let's check if 2 * 49 - 24 works.
2 * 49 = 98
98 - 24 = 74. No.

Let's check if 24 * 2 + 49 works.
24 * 2 = 48
48 + 49 = 97. Yes.

Let's check if 49 + 2 * 24 works.
49 + 48 = 97. Yes.

Let's check if 2 * 49 + 24 works.
2 * 49 = 98
98 + 24 = 122. No.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 98, 85, 33, and 37 to reach the target value of 83.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Start with the largest numbers:
    *   98 - 85 = 13. Remaining numbers are 33, 37. Target is 83. Can I get 83 from 13 and 33, 37?
        *   13 + 33 + 37 = 83. This works!
        *   Equation: 98 - 85 + 33 + 37 = 83.
        *   Let's check: 98 - 85 = 13. 13 + 33 = 46. 46 + 37 = 83.

1109,1880,"<think>The user wants a single equation using the numbers 33, 2, 97, and 60 exactly once.
The allowed operations are +, -, *, /.
The result of the equation must be 92.

Let's list the numbers: {33, 2, 97, 60}
Target result: 92

I need to combine these numbers using the four basic operations to reach 92.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite spread out. 97 is close to 92.
Maybe I can subtract something from 97 or add something to a combination of the other numbers to get 92.

Possibility 1: Start with 97.
97 - x = 92 => x = 5. Can I make 5 from {33, 2, 60}?
(60 / ?) - 33? No.
(33 / ?) + 2? No.
(60 - 33) / 2 = 27 / 2 (not an integer)
(60 + 33) / 2 = 93 / 2 (not an integer)
60 - 33 - 2 = 25. No.
60 - (33 * 2) = 60 - 66 = -6. No.
33 - (60 / 2) = 33 - 30 = 3. No.
(60 / 2) - 33 = 30 - 33 = -3. No.
33 * 2 - 60 = 66 - 60 = 6. No.
60 / (33 - 2) = 60 / 31. No.
(60 + 2) / 33 = 62 / 33. No.
(33 + 2) * ? No.

Possibility 2: Try to get close to 92 with multiplication.
33 * 2 = 66. Remaining numbers are {97, 60}.
66 + 97 - 60 = 163 - 60 = 103. No.
66 + 60 - 97 = 126 - 97 = 29. No.
66 * ? No.

Possibility 3: Try division.
60 / 2 = 30. Remaining numbers are {33, 97}.
30 + 33 + 97 = 160. No.
30 + 97 - 33 = 127 - 33 = 94. Close!
30 + 33 - 97 = 63 - 97 = -34. No.
30 * 33 + 97 = 990 + 97. No.
30 * 97 + 33. No.

Let's re-examine 30 + 97 - 33 = 94. I need 92.
The numbers used are 60, 2, 97, 33.
The equation is (60 / 2) + 97 - 33 = 94.
I need to adjust this by -2.

Can I rearrange the operations or numbers to get -2 difference?
The current calculation is 30 + 97 - 33.
If I change the order of subtraction: 30 - 33 + 97 = -3 + 97 = 94. Same.
If I change the order of addition: 97 + 30 - 33 = 127 - 33 = 94. Same.

Let's try another starting point.
Maybe 33 * 2 = 66. Numbers left: {97, 60}.
66 + 97 - 60 = 103.
66 + 60 - 97 = 29.

What if I use 97 and 60 first?
97 - 60 = 37. Numbers left: {33, 2}.
37 + 33 + 2 = 72. No.
37 + 33 - 2 = 68. No.
37 - 33 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6. No.
37 * 2 + 33 = 74 + 33 = 107. No.
37 * 33 + 2. No.

97 + 60 = 157. Numbers left: {33, 2}.
157 - 33 - 2 = 122. No.
157 - (33 * 2) = 157 - 66 = 91. Close!
The numbers used are 97, 60, 33, 2.
The equation is 97 + 60 - (33 * 2) = 91.
I need 92. I am off by +1.

Let's try to get +1 from the current expression.
97 + 60 - (33 * 2) = 91.
Can I change the operations slightly?
What if I add 2 instead of multiplying?
97 + 60 - 33 - 2 = 157 - 35 = 122. No.

Let's go back to 97 + 60 - (33 * 2) = 91.
The numbers are {97, 60, 33, 2}.
The operations are +, -, *.
I need to get 92.

Consider the expression: 97 + 60 - 66 = 91.
I need to increase the result by 1.
How can I change the expression to increase the result by 1?

Let's try rearranging the numbers and operations.
Numbers: {33, 2, 97, 60}. Target: 92.

Try starting with 33.
33 * 2 = 66. Left: {97, 60}.
66 + 97 - 60 = 103.
66 + 60 - 97 = 29.

Try starting with 60.
60 * 2 = 120. Left: {33, 97}.
120 - 33 + 97 = 87 + 97 = 184. No.
120 + 33 - 97 = 153 - 97 = 56. No.
120 - 97 + 33 = 23 + 33 = 56. No.

Try starting with 97.
97 * 2 = 194. Left: {33, 60}.
194 - 60 - 33 = 134 - 33 = 101. No.
194 - (60 + 33) = 194 - 93 = 101. No.

Let's reconsider the 94 result: (60 / 2) + 97 - 33 = 94.
Numbers: {60, 2, 97, 33}.
I need to reduce the result by 2.

How can I change (60 / 2) + 97 - 33 to get 92?
The current calculation is 30 + 97 - 33.
If I change the subtraction to addition: 30 + 97 + 33 = 160. No.
If I change the addition to subtraction: 30 - 97 - 33 = -67 - 33 = -100. No.

Let's try grouping differently.
(97 - 33) + (60 / 2) = 64 + 30 = 94. Same.
(97 + 60) - (33 * 2) = 157 - 66 = 91. Close.

Let's look at 91 again: 97 + 60 - (33 * 2) = 91.
Numbers: {97, 60, 33, 2}.
I need to increase the result by 1.

Can I swap operations?
97 + 60 - (33 / 2)? Not integer.

5430,1103,"<think>I need to use the numbers 99, 33, 74, and 17 exactly once to reach the target number 19. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite large, so division might be useful to reduce them.
99 / 33 = 3. This is a good start.
Now I have 3, 74, and 17. I need to get 19.
Can I combine 74 and 17 to get something that, when combined with 3, results in 19?
74 + 17 = 91. 91 + 3 = 94. Too large.
74 - 17 = 57. 57 + 3 = 60. Too large.
17 - 74 is negative.
74 * 17 is very large.
74 / 17 is not an integer.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe combine 74 and 17 first.
74 + 17 = 91.
Now I have 91, 99, 33. Need to get 19.
99 - 91 = 8. 8 + 33 = 41.
91 - 99 is negative.
99 / 33 = 3. 91 + 3 = 94. 91 - 3 = 88.

Let's try combining 99 and 17.
99 + 17 = 116.
Now I have 116, 33, 74. Need to get 19.
116 - 74 = 42. 42 - 33 = 9. Not 19.
74 - 33 = 41. 116 - 41 = 75.

Let's try combining 99 and 74.
99 + 74 = 173.
Now I have 173, 33, 17. Need to get 19.
173 - 33 = 140. 140 - 17 = 123.
173 - 17 = 156. 156 - 33 = 123.

Let's try division with 74.
74 / 2 is 37, but I don't have 2.
74 / 33 is not integer.
74 / 17 is not integer.

Let's go back to 99 / 33 = 3.
Numbers left: 3, 74, 17. Target: 19.
I need to get 19 from 3, 74, 17.
Maybe I can get 16 from 74 and 17, then add 3.
74 - 17 = 57. No.
Maybe I can get 22 from 74 and 17, then subtract 3.
74 - 17 = 57. No.
Maybe I can get 19 from 74 and 17, then add 3.
74 - 17 = 57. No.

Let's try a different initial division.
What if I divide 74 by something? Not obvious.
What if I divide 17 by something? Not obvious.

Let's try multiplication.
33 * 17 = 561. Too large.
33 * 74 = Too large.
99 * 17 = Too large.
99 * 74 = Too large.

Let's reconsider 99 / 33 = 3.
Numbers: 3, 74, 17. Target: 19.
I need to combine 74 and 17 to get a number that, when combined with 3, gives 19.
Possibilities:
1. (74 op 17) op 3 = 19
2. 3 op (74 op 17) = 19

If (74 op 17) = X, then X op 3 = 19.
If op is +, X + 3 = 19 => X = 16. Can I get 16 from 74 and 17? 74 - 17 = 57. No.
If op is -, X - 3 = 19 => X = 22. Can I get 22 from 74 and 17? 74 - 17 = 57. No.
If op is -, 3 - X = 19 => X = -16. No.
If op is *, X * 3 = 19. X = 19/3. No.
If op is /, X / 3 = 19 => X = 57. Can I get 57 from 74 and 17? 74 - 17 = 57. Yes!

So, the steps are:
1. Calculate 74 - 17 = 57.
2. Calculate 99 / 33 = 3.
3. Calculate 57 / 3 = 19.

Let's put it together.
(74 - 17) / (99 / 33) = 57 / 3 = 19.
This uses all numbers once and the allowed operations.

Let's check the order of operations.
(74 - 17) = 57
(99 / 33) = 3
57 / 3 = 19.
This works.

Alternative phrasing:
(99 / 33) = 3
(74 - 17) = 57
57 / 3 = 19.
So, (74 - 17) / (99 / 33) is correct.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.
What if 17 is used in division?
99 / 17 is not integer.
33 / 17 is not integer.
74 / 17 is not integer.

What if 74 is used in division?

33 / 74 is not integer.
17 / 74 is not integer.

What if 33 is used in division?
99 / 33 = 3. (Already explored)
74 / 33 is not integer.
17 / 33 is not integer.

What if 99 is used in division?
33 / 99 is not integer.
74 / 99 is not integer.
17 / 99 is not integer.

The initial division 99 / 33 = 3 seems to be the most promising start.
We had 3, 74, 17 to get 19.
We found (74 - 17) / 3 = 57 / 3 = 19.
So, (74 - 17) / (99 / 33).

Let's try another combination for 3, 74, 17 to get 19.
Could it be 74 - (something from 3 and 17) = 19?

Could it be 17 + (something from 3 and 74) = 19?
17 + X = 19 => X = 2. Can I get 2 from 3 and 74? 74 / 3 is not integer. 74 - 3 = 71. No. 3 - 74 is negative.

Could it be 3 + (something from 74 and 17) = 19?
3 + X = 19 => X = 16. Can I get 16 from 74 and 17? 74 - 17 = 57. No.

Could it be (something from 74 and 3) - 17 = 19?

(77 + 40) = 117. Need to get to 84. 117 - ? = 84. ? = 33. Can we make 33 from 25 and 7? 25 + 7 = 32, 25 - 7 = 18, 25 * 7 = 175, 25 / 7 is not an integer. So this path doesn't work.
(77 - 40) = 37. Need to get to 84. 37 + ? = 84. ? = 47. Can we make 47 from 25 and 7? 25 + 7 = 32, 25 - 7 = 18, 25 * 7 = 175, 25 / 7 is not an integer. So this path doesn't work.
(77 * 40) is too large.
(77 / 7) = 11. Now we have [11, 25, 40]. Target 84.
11 + 25 + 40 = 76. Not 84.
11 * 25 = 275. Too large.
11 * 40 = 440. Too large.
(77 / 7) + 25 + 40 = 11 + 25 + 40 = 76.
(77 / 7) * 25 + 40 = 11 * 25 + 40 = 275 + 40 = 315.
(77 / 7) * 40 + 25 = 11 * 40 + 25 = 440 + 25 = 465.
(77 / 7) + 25 * 40 = 11 + 1000 = 1011.
(77 / 7) + 40 * 25 = 11 + 1000 = 1011.
(77 / 7) + 40 - 25 = 11 + 40 - 25 = 51 - 25 = 26.
(77 / 7) + 25 - 40 = 11 + 25 - 40 = 36 - 40 = -4.
(77 / 7) - 25 + 40 = 11 - 25 + 40 = -14 + 40 = 26.
(77 / 7) - 40 + 25 = 11 - 40 + 25 = -29 + 25 = -4.

Let's try combining 25 and 7 first.

32 * 77 is too large.
32 * 40 is too large.
(25 - 7) = 18. Remaining [18, 77, 40]. Target 84.
18 + 77 + 40 = 135.
18 * 77 is too large.
18 * 40 is too large.
(25 * 7) = 175. Remaining [175, 77, 40]. Target 84.
175 - 77 - 40 = 98 - 40 = 58.
175 - 40 - 77 = 135 - 77 = 58.
175 - (77 + 40) = 175 - 117 = 58.
(25 / 7) is not an integer.

Let's try combining 40 and 7.
(40 + 7) = 47. Remaining [47, 25, 77]. Target 84.
47 + 25 + 77 = 149.
47 * 25 is too large.
47 * 77 is too large.
(40 - 7) = 33. Remaining [33, 25, 77]. Target 84.
33 + 25 + 77 = 135.
33 * 25 is too large.
33 * 77 is too large.
(40 * 7) = 280. Remaining [280, 25, 77]. Target 84.
280 - 25 - 77 = 255 - 77 = 178.
280 - (25 + 77) = 280 - 102 = 178.
(40 / 7) is not an integer.

Let's try combining 77 and 25.
(77 + 25) = 102. Remaining [102, 7, 40]. Target 84.
102 - 7 - 40 = 95 - 40 = 55.
102 - (7 + 40) = 102 - 47 = 55.
102 - 40 + 7 = 62 + 7 = 69.
102 - 7 + 40 = 95 + 40 = 135.
(77 - 25) = 52. Remaining [52, 7, 40]. Target 84.
52 + 7 + 40 = 99.
52 + 40 - 7 = 92 - 7 = 85. Close!
52 + 7 - 40 = 59 - 40 = 19.
52 - 7 + 40 = 45 + 40 = 85. Close!
52 - 40 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19.
(77 * 25) is too large.
(77 / 25) is not an integer.

Let's re-examine (77 - 25) = 52. We have [52, 7, 40]. Target 84.
We got 85 with 52 + 40 - 7 and 52 - 7 + 40.
Let's try multiplication with the remaining numbers.
52 * 7 = 364. Too large.
52 * 40 = 2080. Too large.

Let's try a different structure. Maybe division is involved in a way that reduces numbers significantly.
We saw (77 / 7) = 11. Remaining [11, 25, 40]. Target 84.
We tried adding and subtracting. What about multiplication and subtraction?
11 * 40 = 440. 440 - 25 = 415.
11 * 25 = 275. 275 - 40 = 235.

Let's try combining 40 and 25.
(40 + 25) = 65. Remaining [65, 77, 7]. Target 84.
65 + 77 + 7 = 149.
65 + 77 - 7 = 142 - 7 = 135.
65 - 77 + 7 = -12 + 7 = -5.
65 + 7 - 77 = 72 - 77 = -5.
(40 - 25) = 15. Remaining [15, 77, 7]. Target 84.
15 + 77 + 7 = 99.
15 + 77 - 7 = 92 - 7 = 85. Close again!
15 - 77 + 7 = -62 + 7 = -55.
15 + 7 - 77 = 22 - 77 = -",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

4903,67,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 18, 2, and 44 exactly once, along with standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target value of 28.

I need to explore different combinations and orderings of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 18, 2, 44.
Target: 28.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then incorporating the third.

Possibility 1: Start with 18 and 2.
- 18 + 2 = 20. Now I need to use 44 to get 28. 20 + 44 = 64 (too high). 20 - 44 = -24 (too low). 44 - 20 = 24 (too low). 20 * 44 (too high). 44 / 20 (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 28 easily).
- 18 - 2 = 16. Now use 44. 16 + 44 = 60 (too high). 44 - 16 = 28. This looks promising! The equation would be (44 - 18) + 2 or 44 - (18 - 2). Let's check:
    - (44 - 18) + 2 = 26 + 2 = 28. This works!
    - 44 - (18 - 2) = 44 - 16 = 28. This also works!
    Both use 18, 2, and 44 exactly once.

Let's continue exploring other combinations to be thorough, even though I've found a solution.

- 18 * 2 = 36. Now use 44. 36 + 44 (too high). 44 - 36 = 8 (too low). 36 - 44 (negative). 36 / 44 (fraction). 44 / 36 (fraction).
- 18 / 2 = 9. Now use 44. 9 + 44 = 53 (too high). 44 - 9 = 35 (close, but not 28). 9 - 44 (negative). 9 * 44 (too high). 44 / 9 (fraction).

Possibility 2: Start with 18 and 44.
- 18 + 44 = 62. Now use 2. 62 + 2 = 64. 62 - 2 = 60. 2 - 62 (negative). 62 * 2 (too high). 62 / 2 = 31 (close, but not 28). 2 / 62 (fraction).
- 44 - 18 = 26. Now use 2. 26 + 2 = 28. This is the same solution found earlier: (44 - 18) + 2.
- 18 - 44 (negative).
- 18 * 44 (too high).
- 44 / 18 (fraction).
- 18 / 44 (fraction).

Possibility 3: Start with 2 and 44.
- 2 + 44 = 46. Now use 18. 46 + 18 = 64. 46 - 18 = 28. This is another valid solution: (44 + 2) - 18.
- 44 - 2 = 42. Now use 18. 42 + 18 = 60. 42 - 18 = 24 (too low). 18 - 42 (negative). 42 * 18 (too high). 42 / 18 (fraction). 18 / 42 (fraction).
- 2 * 44 = 88. Now use 18. 88 + 18 (too high). 88 - 18 = 70 (too high). 18 - 88 (negative). 88 / 18 (fraction). 18 / 88 (fraction).
- 44 / 2 = 22. Now use 18. 22 + 18 = 40 (too high). 22 - 18 = 4 (too low). 18 - 22 (negative). 22 * 18 (too high). 18 / 22 (fraction).

So far, I have found two valid equations:
1. (44 - 18) + 2 = 28
2. 44 - (18 - 2) = 28
3. (44 + 2) - 18 = 28

The problem asks for *an* arithmetic equation. I will present one of these. The simplest one to write without explicit parentheses if order of operations is followed is (44 + 2) - 18. However, to be explicit and avoid ambiguity, I will use parentheses.

Let's re-check the first solution: (44 - 18) + 2.
Numbers used: 44, 18, 2. All used once.
Operations used: -, +. Standard operations.
Result: 26 + 2 = 28. Target achieved.

Let's re-check the second solution: 44 - (18 - 2).
Numbers used: 44, 18, 2. All used once.
Operations used: -, -. Standard operations.
Result: 44 - 16 = 28. Target achieved.

Let's re-check the third solution: (44 + 2) - 18.
Numbers used: 44, 2, 18. All used once.
Operations used: +, -. Standard operations.
Result: 46 - 18 = 28. Target achieved.

All three are valid. I will choose the first one found: (44 - 18) + 2.

<answer>(44 - 18) + 2 = 28</answer>",1.0,
61,1282,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 81, 70, and 68, with the result being 83. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 81, 70, 68.
Target result: 83.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. I can try different combinations and orders.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 83
2. a op (b op c) = 83

Let's try combining 81 and 70 first.
81 + 70 = 151. 151 op 68 = 83?
151 - 68 = 83. This works!

Let's check if this uses all numbers and operations correctly.
Numbers used: 81, 70, 68 (all used once).
Operations used: +, - (allowed).
Result: 83 (correct).

So, the equation is (81 + 70) - 68 = 83.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, though the first one seems straightforward.

What if I start with 81 and 68?
81 + 68 = 149. 149 op 70 = 83?
149 - 70 = 79. Not 83.
149 + 70 = 219. Not 83.
149 * 70 = too large.
149 / 70 = not an integer.

81 - 68 = 13. 13 op 70 = 83?
13 + 70 = 83. This also works!
Numbers used: 81, 68, 70 (all used once).
Operations used: -, + (allowed).
Result: 83 (correct).

So, the equation is (81 - 68) + 70 = 83.

What if I start with 70 and 68?
70 + 68 = 138. 138 op 81 = 83?
138 - 81 = 57. Not 83.
138 + 81 = too large.

70 - 68 = 2. 2 op 81 = 83?
2 + 81 = 83. This also works!
Numbers used: 70, 68, 81 (all used once).
Operations used: -, + (allowed).
Result: 83 (correct).

So, the equation is (70 - 68) + 81 = 83.

70 * 68 = too large.
70 / 68 = not an integer.

What about multiplication or division first?
Let's try 81 / ?
81 / 70 = not integer.
81 / 68 = not integer.

Let's try 70 / ?
70 / 81 = not integer.
70 / 68 = not integer.

Let's try 68 / ?
68 / 81 = not integer.
68 / 70 = not integer.

What about multiplication?
81 * 70 = too large.
81 * 68 = too large.
70 * 68 = too large.

It seems the solutions involve addition and subtraction. I have found three valid solutions:
1. (81 + 70) - 68 = 83
2. (81 - 68) + 70 = 83
3. (70 - 68) + 81 = 83

The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I will provide one of them. The first one I found is (81 + 70) - 68 = 83.
Let's double check the requirements:
- Numbers: [81 70 68] - used exactly once. Yes.
- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division - used + and -. Yes.
- Result: 83. Yes.

I will present (81 + 70) - 68 = 83.

<answer>(81 + 70) - 68 = 83</answer>",1.0,
4709,1704,"<think>The numbers are [53, 98, 4, 68] and the target is 28.
I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

First, let's look at the target number 28. It's a relatively small number compared to the given numbers. This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the magnitude.

Let's try to get close to 28 using some of the numbers.
98 / 4 = 24.5 (not an integer, might be tricky)
98 / 2 = 49 (if 2 was available)
68 / 4 = 17
53 - ?
98 - ?
68 - ?

Let's try using the largest numbers first.
98 and 68.
98 - 68 = 30. Close to 28.
If we have 30, we need to use 53 and 4 to get -2.
Can we get -2 from 53 and 4?
53 + 4 = 57
53 - 4 = 49
4 - 53 = -49
53 * 4 = 212
53 / 4 (not integer)
4 / 53 (not integer)
So, (98 - 68) + (something from 53, 4) doesn't seem to work easily.

Let's try another combination with 98 and 68.
98 + 68 = 166. Too large.
98 * 68 = very large.
98 / 68 (not integer)
68 / 98 (not integer)

Let's try 98 and 53.
98 - 53 = 45.
We need to use 4 and 68 to get 28 - 45 = -17.
Can we get -17 from 4 and 68?
68 + 4 = 72
68 - 4 = 64
4 - 68 = -64
68 * 4 = 272
68 / 4 = 17.
So, if we have 17, we need -17.
This means we need to subtract 17.
So, (98 - 53) - (68 / 4) = 45 - 17 = 28.
This looks like a valid solution.
Let's check:
Numbers used: 98, 53, 68, 4. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -, /. Standard operations.
Result: 45 - 17 = 28. Correct target.

Let's verify the order of operations.
(98 - 53) - (68 / 4)
First, the parentheses:
98 - 53 = 45
68 / 4 = 17
Then, the subtraction:
45 - 17 = 28.

This works.

Let's try other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there's a simpler one.

What if we start with 68 and 4?
68 / 4 = 17.
We need to use 53 and 98 to get 28 - 17 = 11.
Can we get 11 from 53 and 98?
98 - 53 = 45 (too large)
53 - 98 = -45 (too small)
98 + 53 = 151 (too large)
98 * 53 (too large)
98 / 53 (not integer)
53 / 98 (not integer)
So, (68 / 4) + (something from 53, 98) doesn't seem to work.

What if we try multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract?
Let's try 4 * 68 = 272.
We need to use 53 and 98 to get 28 - 272 = -244.
Can we get -244 from 53 and 98?
53 - 98 = -45
98 - 53 = 45
53 + 98 = 151
53 * 98 = 5194
No, this doesn't seem to work.

Let's try 4 * 53 = 212.
We need to use 98 and 68 to get 28 - 212 = -184.
Can we get -184 from 98 and 68?
98 - 68 = 30
68 - 98 = -30
98 + 68 = 166
98 * 68 = large
No.

Let's try 4 * 98 = 392.
We need to use 53 and 68 to get 28 - 392 = -364.
Can we get -364 from 53 and 68?
53 - 68 = -15
68 - 53 = 15
53 + 68 = 121
53 * 68 = large
No.

Let's reconsider the first solution: (98 - 53) - (68 / 4) = 28.
This seems robust.

Let's try to see if we can use division differently.
Maybe divide a sum or difference.
(98 + 4) / ? = 102 / ?
(98 - 4) / ? = 94 / ?
(68 + 4) / ? = 72 / ?
(68 - 4) / ? = 64 / ?
(53 + 4) / ? = 57 / ?
(53 - 4) / ? = 49 / ?

Let's try dividing by 4.
(98 + 53 + 68) / 4 = 219 / 4 (not integer)
(98 + 53 - 68) / 4 = 83 / 4 (not integer)
(98 - 53 + 68) / 4 = 113 / 4 (not integer)
(98 - 53 - 68) / 4 = -23 / 4 (not integer)

Let's try dividing by 2 (if we could make 2). We can't make 2 easily.

Let's try to get 28 by multiplying two numbers.
Possible factors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
Can we make 4 and 7?
We have 4. Can we make 7 from 53, 98, 68?
98 - 53 - 68 = -23
98 - 68 - 53 = -23
68 - 53 = 15
98 / ?
No obvious way to make 7.

Can we make 14 and 2?
We don't have 2.

Can we make 28 and 1?
We have 4, 53, 98, 68.
Can we make 28 from three numbers?
98 - 68 - 4 = 26 (close)
98 - 53 - ?
68 - 4 = 64
98 - 68 = 30
53 - 4 = 49

Let's go back to the solution: (98 - 53) - (68 / 4) = 28.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there's another structure.
Maybe something like A * B + C - D = 28.
Or A / B + C * D = 28.

Consider 68 / 4 = 17.
We need to get 11 from 53 and 98. We already checked this, it doesn't work.

Consider 98 / ?
98 / 4 = 24.5 (not good)

Consider 53.
53 - ? = 28 => ? = 25.

535,1019,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 36, 16, 87, and 22 exactly once, with only +, -, *, / operations, to result in 93.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible combinations and operations:
1. Start with the largest number, 87. We need to add 6 to it.
   - Can we get 6 from 36, 16, 22?
     - 36 / (22 - 16) = 36 / 6 = 6. This looks promising.
     - So, 87 + (36 / (22 - 16)) = 87 + 6 = 93.
     - This uses all numbers (36, 16, 87, 22) exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's verify:
- Numbers used: 36, 16, 87, 22 (all used once)
- Operations used: +, /, - (all allowed)
- Result: 87 + (36 / (22 - 16)) = 87 + (36 / 6) = 87 + 6 = 93.

This equation works.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure or to explore alternatives, though the first one is valid.

2. Try multiplying two numbers:

   - 36 * 22 = 792 (too large)
   - 16 * 22 = 352 (too large)
   - 36 * (something small)
   - 16 * (something small)
   - 22 * (something small)

3. Try dividing:
   - 36 / 16 (not an integer)
   - 36 / 22 (not an integer)
   - 16 / 36 (fraction)
   - 16 / 22 (fraction)
   - 22 / 36 (fraction)
   - 22 / 16 (fraction)
   - 87 / 36 (not integer)
   - 87 / 16 (not integer)
   - 87 / 22 (not integer)

4. Let's try building up to 93.
   - 87 + 16 = 103. Need to subtract 10. Can we get 10 from 36 and 22? 36 - 22 = 14. 22 - 36 (negative). 36/22 (fraction). 22/36 (fraction). 36*22 (large). No.
   - 87 + 22 = 109. Need to subtract 16. We have 36 and 16 left. Can we get 16 from 36 and 16? No, we need to use 16 itself. This path doesn't work.
   - 87 + 36 = 123. Need to subtract 30. We have 16 and 22 left. 16 + 22 = 38. 22 - 16 = 6. 16 - 22 = -6. 16 * 22 (large). 16/22 (fraction). 22/16 (fraction). No.

5. Let's revisit the first successful attempt: 87 + (36 / (22 - 16)).
   - This is a valid solution.

Are there other ways to get 6 from 36, 16, 22?

- (36 * 2) + 21? No, we don't have 2 or 21.

Let's try multiplication with one of the numbers.
- 36 * X + Y = 93
- 16 * X + Y = 93
- 22 * X + Y = 93
- 87 * X + Y = 93

Consider 22 * 5 = 110. Need to subtract 17. Can we get 5 from 36, 16, 87? No.

Consider 16 * 6 = 96. Need to subtract 3. Can we get 6 from 36, 87, 22?

The user wants an equation using the numbers 8, 47, and 44 to equal 99.
I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Addition/Subtraction focused:**
    *   8 + 47 + 44 = 99. This is the simplest and it works!

Let's double-check if any other combinations are possible, though the first one is usually the intended one if it's straightforward.

*   (47 + 44) + 8 = 91 + 8 = 99. (Same as above)
*   (47 + 8) + 44 = 55 + 44 = 99. (Same as above)
*   (44 + 8) + 47 = 52 + 47 = 99. (Same as above)

*   47 - 8 + 44 = 39 + 44 = 83 (Not 99)
*   44 - 8 + 47 = 36 + 47 = 83 (Not 99)
*   47 + 44 - 8 = 91 - 8 = 83 (Not 99)

2.  **Multiplication/Division involved:**
    *   8 * 47 = 376. Then 376 + 44 or 376 - 44 or 376 / 44 (not integer) or 44 / 376 (not integer). None will work.
    *   8 * 44 = 352. Then 352 + 47 or 352 - 47 or 352 / 47 (not integer) or 47 / 352 (not integer). None will work.
    *   47 * 44 = 2068. Too large.
    *   8 / 47 (not integer)
    *   8 / 44 (not integer)
    *   47 / 8 (not integer)
    *   47 / 44 (not integer)
    *   44 / 8 (not integer)
    *   44 / 47 (not integer)

It seems the simple addition is the only viable solution.
The equation is 8 + 47 + 44 = 99.

5373,1407,"<think>I need to combine 16, 21, and 2 to get 29.
I have the numbers 16, 21, and 2. The target is 29.

Let's try combining the numbers.
Possible combinations:
1. Addition: 16 + 21 + 2 = 39 (too high)
2. Subtraction:
   21 - 16 - 2 = 3 (too low)
   21 - 2 - 16 = 3 (too low)
   16 - 21 - 2 = -7 (not 29)
   16 - 2 - 21 = -7 (not 29)
   2 - 16 - 21 = -35 (not 29)
   2 - 21 - 16 = -35 (not 29)
3. Multiplication:
   16 * 21 * 2 = 672 (too high)
4. Division:
   16 / 21 / 2 (not likely to be an integer)
   21 / 16 / 2 (not likely to be an integer)
   2 / 16 / 21 (not likely to be an integer)

Let's try combinations of operations.
Target is 29.
Numbers are 16, 21, 2.

Try using 21 and 16 first.
21 + 16 = 37. Need to subtract 8. I have 2. Can't make 8 from 2.
21 - 16 = 5. Need to add 24. I have 2. Can't make 24 from 2.
16 - 21 = -5. Need to add 34. I have 2. Can't make 34 from 2.
16 * 21 = 336. Too big.
21 / 16 (not integer)
16 / 21 (not integer)

Try using 21 and 2 first.
21 + 2 = 23. Need to add 6. I have 16. Can't make 6 from 16.
21 - 2 = 19. Need to add 10. I have 16. Can't make 10 from 16.
2 - 21 = -19. Need to add 48. I have 16. Can't make 48 from 16.
21 * 2 = 42. Need to subtract 13. I have 16. Can't make 13 from 16.
21 / 2 (not integer)
2 / 21 (not integer)

Try using 16 and 2 first.
16 + 2 = 18. Need to add 11. I have 21. Can't make 11 from 21.
16 - 2 = 14. Need to add 15. I have 21. Can't make 15 from 21.
2 - 16 = -14. Need to add 43. I have 21. Can't make 43 from 21.
16 * 2 = 32. Need to subtract 3. I have 21. Can't make 3 from 21.
16 / 2 = 8. Need to add 21. I have 21. This works! 8 + 21 = 29.
The numbers used are 16, 2, and 21. All used once.
The operations are division and addition.
The equation is (16 / 2) + 21 = 8 + 21 = 29.

Let's check if there are other possibilities.
What if 21 is involved in multiplication or division with 16 or 2?
(21 * 2) - 16 = 42 - 16 = 26 (close, but not 29)
(21 * 16) / 2 = 336 / 2 = 168 (too high)
(16 * 2) + 21 = 32 + 21 = 53 (too high)
(21 + 16) - 2 = 37 - 2 = 35 (too high)
(21 - 16) + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 (too low)
(16 - 2) + 21 = 14 + 21 = 35 (too high)
(21 * 2) + 16 = 42 + 16 = 58 (too high)

The solution (16 / 2) + 21 seems correct.
Let's write it as 21 + (16 / 2) as well, it's the same result.
The order of operations matters. Division first, then addition.
16 / 2 = 8
8 + 21 = 29

Another way to write it: 21 + 16 / 2. This implies 21 + (16/2) due to order of operations.
Or (21 + 16) / 2 = 37 / 2 (not integer)
Or 16 / 2 + 21.

The most straightforward representation is (16 / 2) + 21.
Or 21 + (16 / 2).
Let's stick to the first one.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 34, 44, and 62 exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target result of 72.

Let's list the numbers: [34, 44, 62]
Target: 72

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 72
2. a op (b op c) = 72

Let's try combinations:

Combination 1: Using 34, 44, 62
- (34 + 44) + 62 = 78 + 62 = 140 (Too high)
- (34 + 44) - 62 = 78 - 62 = 16 (Too low)
- (34 - 44) + 62 = -10 + 62 = 52 (Too low)
- (34 - 44) - 62 = -10 - 62 = -72 (Close, but negative)
- (44 - 34) + 62 = 10 + 62 = 72 (This works!)

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 44, 34, 62 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: -, + (allowed)
Result: 72 (target achieved)

The equation is (44 - 34) + 62 = 72.

Let's check other possibilities just to be thorough, though I've found a solution.

- (34 * 44) + 62 = 1496 + 62 = 1558 (Too high)
- (34 * 44) - 62 = 1496 - 62 = 1434 (Too high)
- (34 / 44) ... (will result in a fraction, unlikely to reach 72 with integers)
- (44 / 34) ... (fraction)
- (62 / 34) ... (fraction)
- (62 / 44) ... (fraction)
- (34 + 62) + 44 = 96 + 44 = 140
- (34 + 62) - 44 = 96 - 44 = 52
- (34 - 62) + 44 = -28 + 44 = 16
- (34 - 62) - 44 = -28 - 44 = -72
- (62 - 34) + 44 = 28 + 44 = 72 (This also works!)

So, (62 - 34) + 44 = 72 is another valid solution.
Numbers used: 62, 34, 44 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: -, + (allowed)
Result: 72 (target achieved)

Let's try multiplication with one number and then add/subtract the others.
- 34 * (44 + 62) = 34 * 106 = 3604 (Too high)
- 34 * (44 - 62) = 34 * (-18) = -612 (Too low)
- 34 * (62 - 44) = 34 * 18 = 612 (Too high)
- 44 * (34 + 62) = 44 * 96 = 4224 (Too high)
- 44 * (34 - 62) = 44 * (-28) = -1232 (Too low)
- 44 * (62 - 34) = 44 * 28 = 1232 (Too high)
- 62 * (34 + 44) = 62 * 78 = 4836 (Too high)
- 62 * (34 - 44) = 62 * (-10) = -620 (Too low)
- 62 * (44 - 34) = 62 * 10 = 620 (Too high)

Let's try division.
- 62 / (44 - 34) = 62 / 10 = 6.2 (Not integer)
- 44 / (62 - 34) = 44 / 28 (Not integer)
- 34 / (62 - 44) = 34 / 18 (Not integer)

It seems the additive/subtractive combinations are the most promising.
I have found two valid solutions:
1. (44 - 34) + 62 = 72
2. (62 - 34) + 44 = 72

The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I will provide one of them. The first one I found was (44 - 34) + 62 = 72.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Numbers from [34 44 62]: Yes, all used.
- Result of 72: Yes.
- Only +, -, *, / operations: Yes, used - and +.
- Each number used exactly once: Yes.

The solution (44 - 34) + 62 = 72 is correct.
The solution (62 - 34) + 44 = 72 is also correct.

I will present the first one found.

I can only use the operations +, -, *, /.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible combinations and operations:

1.  Try to get close to 21 with a few numbers and then adjust with the others.
    *   54 / ?
    *   64 / ?
    *   25 - ?
    *   14 + ?

2.  Let's try division first, as it can reduce numbers quickly.
    *   54 / 25 is not an integer.
    *   54 / 14 is not an integer.
    *   64 / 25 is not an integer.
    *   64 / 14 is not an integer.
    *   25 / 14 is not an integer.
    *   54 / 64 is not an integer.

    This suggests division might be used later or on intermediate results.

3.  Let's try multiplication.
    *   14 * 64 = 896 (too big)
    *   14 * 25 = 350 (too big)
    *   14 * 54 = 756 (too big)

    *   64 * 54 = 3456 (too big)
    *   25 * 54 = 1350 (too big)

    Multiplication seems unlikely to be the first operation unless it's with a small number or results in a number that can be divided down.

4.  Let's try addition and subtraction.
    *   54 - 25 = 29. Remaining numbers are 14, 64. Can we get 21 from 29, 14, 64?

        *   40 + 25 = 65. 65 - 64 = 1.
        *   40 - 25 = 15. 15 + 64 = 79.
        *   40 + 64 = 104. 104 - 25 = 79.
        *   40 - 64 = -24. -24 + 25 = 1.

        *   Or 25 - 14 + 64 - 54 = 21.

2015,1615,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 90, 54, 55, and 5 exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to form an equation that evaluates to 100.

Let the given numbers be $n_1 = 90$, $n_2 = 54$, $n_3 = 55$, and $n_4 = 5$. We need to find an arrangement and combination of these numbers and operations such that the result is 100.

Let's try different combinations and see if we can reach 100.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

We have 4 numbers, so we will have 3 operations.

Let's consider the order of operations. Parentheses can be used to change the order.

Let's try to get close to 100 first.
90 + 5 + 55 - 54 = 100. This uses all numbers and basic operations. Let's check:
90 + 5 = 95
95 + 55 = 150
150 - 54 = 96. This is close but not 100.

Let's try another combination.
Maybe multiplication can help us reach 100 faster or in a different way.

Consider the number 5. Multiplying by 5 or dividing by 5 might be useful.
55 / 5 = 11.
If we have 11, can we combine 90 and 54 to get 89?
90 - 54 = 36. Not 89.
90 + 54 = 144. Not 89.
90 * 54 is too large.
90 / 54 is not an integer.

Let's try using 55 and 5 together in a different way.
55 * 5 = 275.
Can we get 100 from 90, 54, and 275? Unlikely.

Let's try using 90 and 5.
90 / 5 = 18.
Now we have 18, 54, 55. Can we get 100?
18 + 54 + 55 = 127.
18 + 54 - 55 = 17.
18 - 54 + 55 = 19.
18 * 54 is too large.
18 * 55 is too large.

Let's try using 54 and 5.
54 / 5 is not an integer.
54 * 5 = 270.

Let's try using 90 and 54.
90 / 54 is not an integer.
90 * 54 is too large.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with others, results in 100.
Maybe we can make 100 directly from two numbers.
55 + 5 = 60. Remaining: 90, 54. Can we get 40 from 90 and 54?
90 - 54 = 36. Close.
90 + 54 = 144.
90 / 54 is not integer.
90 * 54 is too large.

Let's try 90 + 54 = 144. Remaining: 55, 5. Can we get -44 from 55 and 5?
5 - 55 = -50.
55 - 5 = 50.
5 * 55 = 275.
55 / 5 = 11.

Let's try 90 - 54 = 36. Remaining: 55, 5. Can we get 64 from 55 and 5?

Let's try 55 + 5 = 60. Remaining: 90, 54. Can we get 40 from 90 and 54?
90 - 54 = 36.

Let's try to use division to reduce numbers.
54 / 9 = 6. We don't have 9.
54 / 6 = 9. We don't have 6.
54 / 3 = 18. We don't have 3.
54 / 2 = 27. We don't have 2.

55 / 5 = 11.
We have 90, 54, 11. Can we get 100?
90 + 11 = 101. We need to subtract 1 from 54. Not possible.
90 + 54 + 11 = 155.
90 + 54 - 11 = 133.
90 - 54 + 11 = 47.
90 - 54 - 11 = 25.

Let's try to make a number that can be multiplied to get close to 100.
For example, if we can make 20, then 20 * 5 = 100.
Can we make 20 from 90, 54, 55?
90 - 54 - 55 = -19.
90 + 54 - 55 = 89.
90 - (54 + 55) = 90 - 109 = -19.

What if we try to make 100 using multiplication and addition/subtraction?
Maybe something like (A * B) + C + D = 100.
Or (A * B) - C - D = 100.
Or (A * B) + C - D = 100.

Let's try multiplying 5 by something.
If we multiply 5 by 20, we get 100. Can we make 20 from 90, 54, 55?
90 - 54 - 55 = -19.
90 - (54 + 55) = -19.
(90 + 54) / ?
(90 - 54) / ? = 36 / ?

Let's try multiplying 55 by something.
55 * 1 = 55. Need 45 from 90, 54, 5.
90 - 54 + 5 = 41. Close.
90 + 5 - 54 = 41.
90 - (54 - 5) = 90 - 49 = 41.
90 - (54 + 5) = 90 - 59 = 31.

Let's try multiplying 54 by something.
54 * 1 = 54. Need 46 from 90, 55, 5.
90 - 55 + 5 = 40.
90 + 5 - 55 = 40.
90 - (55 - 5) = 90 - 50 = 40.
90 - (55 + 5) = 90 - 60 = 30.

Let's try multiplying 90 by something.
90 * 1 = 90. Need 10 from 54, 55, 5.
55 + 5 - 54 = 6.
55 - 54 + 5 = 6.
55 - (54 - 5) = 55 - 49 = 6.
55 - (54 + 5) = 55 - 59 = -4.

Let's consider division again.
(90 + 54) / ? = 144 / ?
(90 - 54) / ? = 36 / ?
(54 - 90) / ? = -18 / ?

(55 + 5) / ? = 60 / ?

5710,1197,"<think>The problem asks me to construct a mathematical equation using the numbers [7, 34, 83] exactly once, and only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value of 56.

I need to explore combinations of these three numbers. Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 7, 34, 83
Target: 56

I will try different combinations and orders of operations.

Strategy 1: Start with the largest number (83) and see if I can adjust it.
- 83 - ? = 56. The difference is 83 - 56 = 27. Can I make 27 from 7 and 34?
  - 34 - 7 = 27. Yes!
  So, the equation could be 83 - (34 - 7).
  Let's check: 83 - (34 - 7) = 83 - 27 = 56.
  This uses 83, 34, and 7 exactly once. It uses subtraction twice. The operations are basic. The target is reached. This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to ensure I've considered enough.

Strategy 2: Try multiplication.
- Can I multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the third?
  - 7 * 34 = 238. 238 + 83 = 321 (too high). 238 - 83 = 155 (too high). 83 - 238 (negative).
  - 7 * 83 = 581. 581 + 34 (too high). 581 - 34 (too high). 34 - 581 (negative).
  - 34 * 83 = 2822. Way too high.

Strategy 3: Try division.
- Division often leads to non-integer results unless carefully planned.
  - 83 / 7 (not an integer)
  - 83 / 34 (not an integer)
  - 34 / 7 (not an integer)
  - 34 / 83 (fraction)
  - 7 / 34 (fraction)
  - 7 / 83 (fraction)
  It's unlikely that division will be the primary operation leading to an integer target unless the numbers are specifically chosen for it.

Strategy 4: Combine numbers in different orders with addition and subtraction.
- (7 + 34) + 83 = 41 + 83 = 124 (too high)
- (7 + 34) - 83 = 41 - 83 = -42 (wrong)
- (7 - 34) + 83 = -27 + 83 = 56. This is another valid solution!
  Let's check: (7 - 34) + 83 = -27 + 83 = 56.
  This uses 7, 34, and 83 exactly once. It uses subtraction and addition. The operations are basic. The target is reached.

- (7 - 34) - 83 = -27 - 83 = -110 (wrong)
- (34 - 7) + 83 = 27 + 83 = 110 (too high)
- (34 - 7) - 83 = 27 - 83 = -56 (wrong)
- (83 - 7) + 34 = 76 + 34 = 110 (too high)
- (83 - 7) - 34 = 76 - 34 = 42 (wrong)
- (83 - 34) + 7 = 49 + 7 = 56. This is another valid solution!
  Let's check: (83 - 34) + 7 = 49 + 7 = 56.
  This uses 83, 34, and 7 exactly once. It uses subtraction and addition. The operations are basic. The target is reached.

I have found three potential solutions:
1. 83 - (34 - 7) = 56
2. (7 - 34) + 83 = 56
3. (83 - 34) + 7 = 56

All three are valid according to the rules. The problem asks for ""an"" equation, so any one of these will suffice. I will pick the first one I found as it's straightforward.

Let's re-verify the chosen solution: 83 - (34 - 7)
Numbers used: 83, 34, 7 (each exactly once).
Operations used: -, - (basic arithmetic).
Target value: 56.
Calculation: 83 - (34 - 7) = 83 - 27 = 56.
All constraints are met.

I will present the equation 83 - (34 - 7).
</think><answer>83 - (34 - 7)</answer>",1.0,
4172,536,"<think>The user wants an equation that uses the numbers 47, 48, and 24 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to result in 24.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with 48:**
    *   48 / 2 = 24. Can I use 47 to get 2? No, not easily.
    *   48 - 24 = 24. Can I use 47 to get 0? No.
    *   48 * ? = 24. This would require a fraction (1/2), which is hard to get from 47 and 24.
    *   48 + ? = 24. This would require a negative number, which is hard to get.

2.  **Start with 47:**
    *   47 + 1 = 48. Can I get 1 from 48 and 24? 48/24 = 2. No.
    *   47 - 23 = 24. Can I get 23 from 48 and 24? 48-24 = 24. No.
    *   47 * ? = 24. Unlikely.

3.  **Start with 24:**
    *   24 * 1 = 24. Can I get 1 from 47 and 48? (48-47) = 1. Yes!
    *   So, 24 * (48 - 47) = 24 * 1 = 24.
    *   This uses 24, 48, and 47 exactly once.
    *   It uses multiplication and subtraction.
    *   The result is 24.

Let's double-check:
Equation: 24 * (48 - 47)
Numbers used: 24, 48, 47 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: *, - (allowed operations).
Calculation:
48 - 47 = 1
24 * 1 = 24
Result: 24 (correct).

This equation meets all the conditions.

Another possibility:
*   (48 / 24) * ? = 24. (48/24) = 2. So 2 * ? = 24. ? = 12. Can I get 12 from 47? No.

Let's re-evaluate the first successful one.
24 * (48 - 47) = 24. This is solid.

Are there others?
What if we try division last?
*   (47 + 48) / ? = 24. 95 / ? = 24. ? = 95/24 (not an integer, unlikely to get from 24).
*   (48 - 47) / ? = 24. 1 / ? = 24. ? = 1/24 (unlikely).

What if we try addition last?
*   47 + 48 + 24 = 119 (too big)
*   47 + 48 - 24 = 71 (too big)
*   47 - 48 + 24 = 23 (close, but not 24)
*   48 - 47 + 24 = 1 + 24 = 25 (close, but not 24)

What if we try subtraction last?
*   47 - (48 - 24) = 47 - 24 = 23 (close)
*   48 - (47 - 24) = 48 - 23 = 25 (close)
*   48 - (24 - 47) = 48 - (-23) = 71 (too big)
*   24 - (47 - 48) = 24 - (-1) = 25 (close)
*   24 - (48 - 47) = 24 - 1 = 23 (close)

The equation 24 * (48 - 47) = 24 seems to be the most straightforward and correct.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 83, 4, and 2 to reach the target number 85.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with 83:**
    *   83 + 4 + 2 = 89 (Too high)
    *   83 + 4 - 2 = 85 (This works!)
    *   83 - 4 + 2 = 81 (Too low)
    *   83 - 4 - 2 = 77 (Too low)
    *   83 * 4 ... (This will be too large)
    *   83 / 4 ... (Not an integer, unlikely to work easily)

2.  **Start with 4:**
    *   4 * 83 ... (Too large)
    *   4 + 83 + 2 = 89 (Too high)
    *   4 + 83 - 2 = 85 (This works!)
    *   4 - 83 ... (Negative, unlikely)
    *   4 / 2 = 2. Then use 83.
        *   2 + 83 = 85 (This works!)
        *   83 + 2 = 85 (Same as above)
        *   83 - 2 = 81
        *   2 - 83 = -81
        *   2 * 83 = 166

3.  **Start with 2:**
    *   2 * 83 ... (Too large)
    *   2 + 83 + 4 = 89 (Too high)
    *   2 + 83 - 4 = 81 (Too low)
    *   2 - 83 ... (Negative, unlikely)
    *   2 / 4 ... (Fraction, unlikely)

The combinations that worked are:
*   83 + 4 - 2 = 85
*   4 + 83 - 2 = 85 (Same as above, just order of addition)
*   (4 / 2) + 83 = 85
*   83 + (4 / 2) = 85

Let's verify the constraints:
*   Numbers used: 83, 4, 2 (all used once)
*   Operations used: +, - (for the first one) or /, + (for the second one) (basic arithmetic operations)
*   Result: 85

Both `83 + 4 - 2` and `83 + (4 / 2)` are valid. I will choose the simpler one.

Let's double check `83 + 4 - 2`:
83 + 4 = 87
87 - 2 = 85. Correct.

Let's double check `83 + (4 / 2)`:
4 / 2 = 2
83 + 2 = 85. Correct.

I will present `83 + 4 - 2`.

I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Try starting with the largest numbers:
    *   94 - 61 = 33. Remaining numbers are 46, 4. Target is 75. 33 + 46 + 4 = 83 (too high). 33 + 46 - 4 = 75. This works!
    *   Equation: 94 - 61 + 46 - 4 = 75.

    *   Numbers used: 94, 61, 46, 4 (all used exactly once).
    *   Operations used: -, +, - (basic arithmetic).
    *   Result: 75 (correct).

This seems to be a valid solution. I will format it as requested.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but the first one found is usually sufficient.

2.  Another approach:
    *   (94 + 4) - (61 - 46) = 98 - 15 = 83 (too high)

988,45,"<think>The goal is to reach 35 using the numbers 81, 8, and 3, with each number used exactly once, and only the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: 81, 8, 3.
Target: 35.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. Since there are three numbers, there will be two operations. The order of operations matters, so I should consider different groupings and orders.

Possible combinations of two operations:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try to get close to 35 with some initial calculations.

Consider the largest number, 81.
If I subtract something from 81, I might get closer to 35.
81 - x = 35 => x = 81 - 35 = 46.
Can I make 46 using 8 and 3?
8 + 3 = 11 (No)
8 - 3 = 5 (No)
3 - 8 = -5 (No)
8 * 3 = 24 (No)
8 / 3 (Not an integer, unlikely to be useful unless it cancels out later)
3 / 8 (Not an integer)

So, 81 - (something) doesn't seem to work directly.

What if I add something to a smaller number to reach 35?
Let's try using 8 and 3 first.
8 + 3 = 11. Can I combine 11 with 81 to get 35?
11 + 81 = 92 (No)
81 - 11 = 70 (No)
11 - 81 = -70 (No)
11 * 81 (Too large)
81 / 11 (Not an integer)

8 * 3 = 24. Can I combine 24 with 81 to get 35?
24 + 81 = 105 (No)
81 - 24 = 57 (No)
24 - 81 = -57 (No)
81 / 24 (Not an integer)

Let's consider division.
If 81 is divided by something, it might reduce its value significantly.
81 / 3 = 27.
Now I have 27 and 8. Can I make 35?
27 + 8 = 35.
This looks promising!
The numbers used are 81, 3, and 8.
The operations used are division and addition.
The equation would be (81 / 3) + 8.
Let's verify:
81 / 3 = 27.
27 + 8 = 35.
This works perfectly. All numbers (81, 8, 3) are used exactly once. The operations are division and addition.

Let's check other possibilities just to be thorough.

What if 8 is the divisor?
81 / 8 (Not an integer)
3 / 8 (Not an integer)

What if 3 is the divisor for a combination?
(81 + 8) / 3 = 89 / 3 (Not an integer)
(81 - 8) / 3 = 73 / 3 (Not an integer)
(8 * 3) / 3 = 8 (No)
(81 * 8) / 3 = 648 / 3 = 216 (No)

What if 8 is the divisor for a combination?
(81 + 3) / 8 = 84 / 8 (Not an integer)
(81 - 3) / 8 = 78 / 8 (Not an integer)
(81 * 3) / 8 = 243 / 8 (Not an integer)

Let's consider multiplication.
If I multiply 8 and 3, I get 24.
Can I combine 24 with 81 to get 35?
81 - 24 = 57 (No)
24 - 81 = -57 (No)
81 + 24 = 105 (No)

If I multiply 81 and 3, it's too large.
If I multiply 81 and 8, it's too large.

Let's go back to the successful path: (81 / 3) + 8.
Numbers: 81, 3, 8. Used: 81, 3, 8. Exactly once.
Operations: Division, Addition. Allowed: +, -, *, /.
Result: 35. Target: 35.

The structure is (number / number) + number.
This is a valid structure.

Could there be another solution?

5321,1424,"<think>The target number is 98. The available numbers are 56, 30, 98, and 25.
I need to use each number exactly once with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

The target is 98, and one of the numbers is 98. This suggests that I might be able to isolate 98 or have it as the result of a calculation that is then added to or subtracted from zero, or multiplied by one.

Let's consider using 98 directly.
If I have 98 as the final result, I need to combine 56, 30, and 25 in a way that results in 0, which I can then add to 98.
Can I make 0 from 56, 30, and 25?
56 + 30 = 86. 86 - 25 = 61. Not 0.
56 - 30 = 26. 26 + 25 = 51. Not 0.
56 * 30 is too large.
56 / 30 is not an integer.
30 - 25 = 5. 56 + 5 = 61.
30 + 25 = 55. 56 - 55 = 1. Not 0.
25 - 30 is negative.
25 - 56 is negative.
30 - 56 is negative.

So, making 0 from the other three numbers to add to 98 seems unlikely.

What if 98 is part of a larger calculation?
Maybe I can make a number that, when combined with 98, gives the target.
For example, if I can make 0 from 56, 30, 25, then 98 + 0 = 98. We already explored this.

Let's try to make 98 using other combinations.
The numbers are 56, 30, 98, 25. Target is 98.

Consider operations involving 98.
If I multiply 98 by something, it will likely be too large unless I multiply by 1 or 0.
If I divide 98 by something, it will be smaller.

Let's try to combine the other numbers first and see if they can interact with 98.
Numbers: 56, 30, 25.
Possible combinations:
56 + 30 = 86
56 - 30 = 26
56 * 30 = 1680
56 / 30 (not integer)

56 + 25 = 81
56 - 25 = 31
56 * 25 = 1400
56 / 25 (not integer)

30 + 25 = 55
30 - 25 = 5
30 * 25 = 750
30 / 25 (not integer)

Now, let's try to incorporate 98.
If I have 98, and I need to get 98, I could do:
98 + (something that equals 0)
98 - (something that equals 0)
98 * (something that equals 1)
98 / (something that equals 1)

We already tried making 0 from 56, 30, 25.

Can I make 1 from 56, 30, 25?
56 / 56 = 1. But I need to use 30 and 25.
(56 + 30) / 86 = 1. But I need to use 25.
(56 - 30) / 26 = 1. But I need to use 25.
(30 + 25) / 55 = 1. But I need to use 56.
(56 - 25) / 31 = 1. But I need to use 30.

Let's try a different approach. Maybe 98 is not the final number in a simple addition/subtraction.
What if I combine 56 and 30 first?
56 + 30 = 86. Remaining numbers are 98, 25. Target 98.
Can I get 98 from 86, 98, 25?
86 + 25 = 111. 111 - 98 = 13. Not 98.

81 - 30 = 51. 51 + 98 = 149. Not 98.

What if I combine 30 and 25 first?
30 + 25 = 55. Remaining numbers are 56, 98. Target 98.

55 + 56 = 111. 111 - 98 = 13. Not 98.
55 - 56 = -1. -1 + 98 = 97. Close, but not 98.
55 + 98 = 153. 153 - 56 = 97. Close, but not 98.

Let's try subtraction first.
56 - 30 = 26. Remaining numbers are 98, 25. Target 98.
Can I get 98 from 26, 98, 25?
26 + 25 = 51. 51 + 98 = 149.
26 - 25 = 1. 1 + 98 = 99. Close.
26 + 98 = 124. 124 - 25 = 99. Close.

56 - 25 = 31. Remaining numbers are 98, 30. Target 98.
Can I get 98 from 31, 98, 30?

31 - 30 = 1. 1 + 98 = 99. Close.
31 + 98 = 129. 129 - 30 = 99. Close.

30 - 25 = 5. Remaining numbers are 56, 98. Target 98.
Can I get 98 from 5, 56, 98?
5 + 56 = 61. 61 + 98 = 159.
5 + 98 = 103. 103 - 56 = 47.
56 + 98 = 154. 154 - 5 = 149.

Let's consider multiplication.
56 * 30 = 1680. Too big.
56 * 25 = 1400. Too big.
30 * 25 = 750. Too big.

What if I use division to reduce numbers?

Let's try to make a number that can be added to or subtracted from 98.

4868,38,"<think>The target is 37, and the numbers are 31, 7, 67, and 6. I need to combine these four numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to reach 37.

Let's try to get close to 37 with the larger numbers first.
31 is close to 37. I need to add 6. Can I get 6 from 7, 67, and 6?
If I use 31, I need to get 6 from (7, 67, 6).
Possible combinations for 6:
7 - 6 = 1 (need 67 to make 6, unlikely)
67 / ? = 6 (not an integer)
67 - ? = 6 (need 61, not available)
6 * ? = 6 (need 1, not available)

Let's try combining 31 and 6.
31 + 6 = 37. This uses 31 and 6. I still have 7 and 67 to use, and they must result in 0 when combined with the existing expression.
(31 + 6) + (7 - 67) = 37 - 60 = -23 (no)
(31 + 6) * (7 / 67) (no)
(31 + 6) + (67 - 7) = 37 + 60 = 97 (no)
(31 + 6) - (67 - 7) = 37 - 60 = -23 (no)
(31 + 6) - (7 * 67) (no)

Let's try combining 31 and 7.
31 + 7 = 38. I need to subtract 1. Can I get 1 from 67 and 6?
67 - 6 = 61 (no)
67 / 6 (no)
67 * 6 (no)
6 / 67 (no)

Let's try combining 31 and 67.
67 - 31 = 36. I need to add 1. Can I get 1 from 7 and 6?
7 - 6 = 1. This works!
So, (67 - 31) + (7 - 6) = 36 + 1 = 37.
This uses all numbers (67, 31, 7, 6) exactly once and basic arithmetic operations.

Let's double check the order of operations and parentheses.
(67 - 31) + (7 - 6)
67 - 31 = 36
7 - 6 = 1
36 + 1 = 37.
This is a valid solution.

Are there other possibilities?
What if 31 is involved in a multiplication or division?
31 * ?
31 / ?

What if 67 is involved in a multiplication or division?
67 * ?

Let's consider the number 7.
7 * 6 = 42. I need to subtract 5. Can I get 5 from 31 and 67?
67 - 31 = 36 (no)
31 - 67 (no)

Let's consider the number 6.
6 * 7 = 42. Need to subtract 5. Can I get 5 from 31 and 67? No.
6 * 31 = 186. Too large.
6 * 67 = 402. Too large.

The problem requires me to find a single arithmetic equation that uses the numbers 47, 48, and 24 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, and /, to achieve a result of 24.

The target value is 24.
The available numbers are {47, 48, 24}.
The allowed operations are {+, -, *, /}.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations to get 24. Since there are three numbers, there will be two operations. The order of operations matters, so I need to consider parentheses as well.

Let's list the possible structures for combining three numbers (a, b, c) with two operations:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try to use the numbers in different orders and with different operations.

Strategy:
1. Try to get close to 24 using two numbers, then adjust with the third.
2. Look for combinations that might simplify nicely. For example, division can be powerful.

Let's consider the numbers: 47, 48, 24.
Notice that 48 and 24 are related (48 / 24 = 2, 48 - 24 = 24, 48 + 24 = 72, 48 * 24 is large).
Also, 47 is a prime number, which might make it harder to combine directly to get a small integer unless it's part of a subtraction or addition that cancels out a larger number.

Let's try combinations involving 48 and 24 first, as they seem more likely to produce simpler intermediate results.

Hypothesis 1: Use 48 and 24 to get 24, then incorporate 47.
*   If we do 48 - 24 = 24. Now we have 24 and 47. How to combine them to get 24?
    *   24 + 47 = 71 (No)
    *   24 - 47 = -23 (No)
    *   47 - 24 = 23 (No)
    *   24 * 47 = large (No)
    *   24 / 47 (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 24 easily)
    *   47 / 24 (Not an integer)
    This path doesn't seem promising.

*   If we do 48 / 24 = 2. Now we have 2 and 47. How to combine them to get 24?
    *   2 + 47 = 49 (No)
    *   47 + 2 = 49 (No)
    *   2 - 47 = -45 (No)
    *   47 - 2 = 45 (No)
    *   2 * 47 = 94 (No)
    *   47 * 2 = 94 (No)
    *   2 / 47 (No)
    *   47 / 2 (No)
    This path also doesn't seem promising.

Hypothesis 2: Try to use 47 in a way that it's either added or subtracted from a larger number, or it's part of a multiplication/division that results in a number that can then be combined.

Let's consider the structure (a op1 b) op2 c.
Let a = 47, b = 48, c = 24.
*   (47 + 48) + 24 = 95 + 24 = 119 (No)
*   (47 + 48) - 24 = 95 - 24 = 71 (No)
*   (47 + 48) * 24 = 95 * 24 (Large, No)
*   (47 + 48) / 24 = 95 / 24 (Not integer)

*   (47 - 48) + 24 = -1 + 24 = 23 (Close, but no)
*   (47 - 48) - 24 = -1 - 24 = -25 (No)
*   (47 - 48) * 24 = -1 * 24 = -24 (Close, but wrong sign)
*   (47 - 48) / 24 = -1 / 24 (No)

*   (48 - 47) + 24 = 1 + 24 = 25 (Close, but no)
*   (48 - 47) - 24 = 1 - 24 = -23 (No)
*   (48 - 47) * 24 = 1 * 24 = 24 (YES! This works!)
    The equation is (48 - 47) * 24.
    Let's check:
    Numbers used: 48, 47, 24 (all used exactly once).
    Operations used: -, * (allowed).
    Result: (48 - 47) * 24 = 1 * 24 = 24.

This looks like a valid solution. Let's double-check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one seems straightforward and correct.

Let's try other combinations to ensure I'm not missing something.

1631,1921,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 54, 29, 94, and 44, with the result being 75. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [54, 29, 94, 44]
Target: 75

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to 75.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create numbers that are close to 75 or factors of numbers that can lead to 75.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(94 - 54) + 29 + 44 = 40 + 29 + 44 = 69 + 44 = 113 (Too high)

Attempt 2:
(94 + 54) - 29 - 44 = 148 - 29 - 44 = 119 - 44 = 75 (This works!)

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 94, 54, 29, 44 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: +, -, - (basic arithmetic operations)
Result: 75

The equation is (94 + 54) - 29 - 44 = 75.

Let's double-check the order of operations. Parentheses first:
94 + 54 = 148
Then subtraction from left to right:
148 - 29 = 119
119 - 44 = 75

This is a valid solution.

Let's consider if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, though one valid solution is sufficient.

Attempt 3:
(54 + 44) - 29 + 94 = 98 - 29 + 94 = 69 + 94 = 163 (Too high)

Attempt 4:
(94 - 44) + 54 - 29 = 50 + 54 - 29 = 104 - 29 = 75 (This also works!)

Let's verify Attempt 4:
Numbers used: 94, 44, 54, 29 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: -, +, - (basic arithmetic operations)
Result: 75

Order of operations:
Parentheses first:
94 - 44 = 50
Then addition and subtraction from left to right:
50 + 54 = 104
104 - 29 = 75

This is also a valid solution. The user asked for *an* equation, so either is fine. I'll present the first one I found.

Equation: (94 + 54) - 29 - 44 = 75
Numbers: 94, 54, 29, 44
Target: 75
Operations: +, -, -

Let's try another one just for practice.
Maybe division is involved?
If I divide 94 by 2, I get 47. But I don't have a 2.
If I divide 54 by something? Not obvious.
If I divide 44 by something? Not obvious.

Let's try to make 75 directly.
Maybe 3 * 25? I don't have 3 or 25 easily.
Maybe 5 * 15?
Maybe 75 * 1?

Let's go back to the successful ones.
(94 + 54) - 29 - 44 = 75
(94 - 44) + 54 - 29 = 75

Let's try to use multiplication.
Could I get a number close to 75 by multiplying two numbers?
54 * 29 (too big)
54 * 94 (too big)
54 * 44 (too big)
29 * 94 (too big)
29 * 44 (too big)
94 * 44 (too big)

What about smaller multiplications?
Maybe (29 - ?) * ?
(29 - 4) * ? No 4.
(29 - 5) * ? No 5.

Let's try to get a number that, when added/subtracted from another, gives 75.
For example, if I can make 100, then 100 - 25 = 75.
Can I make 100?
54 + 44 = 98. Close.
54 + 44 + 29 - 94 = 98 + 29 - 94 = 127 - 94 = 33. No.
54 + 44 - 29 + 94 = 98 - 29 + 94 = 69 + 94 = 163. No.

Can I make 50?
94 - 44 = 50. Yes.
Then I have 54 and 29 left.
50 + 54 - 29 = 104 - 29 = 75. This is the second solution I found. (94 - 44) + 54 - 29 = 75.

Can I make 125?
54 + 29 + 44 = 127. Close.
54 + 29 + 44 - 94 = 127 - 94 = 33. No.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided, gives something useful.
If I have 150, then 150 / 2 = 75. I don't have 2.
If I have 300, then 300 / 4 = 75.
Can I make 300?
54 * ?
29 * ?
94 * ?
44 * ?

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied, gives something useful.
If I have 3 * 25 = 75.
Can I make 3? (54 / 18)? No 18. (29 - 26)? No 26. (94 / ?) (44 / ?)
Can I make 25? (54 - 29) = 25. Yes!
So, I have 25 from (54 - 29).
The remaining numbers are 94 and 44.
I need to combine 25 with 94 and 44 to get 75.
If I multiply 25 by something, it will get too big quickly.
25 * (94 / 44) - not integer.
25 * (44 / 94) - not integer.

What if I use 25 and then add/subtract the other numbers?
25 + 94 - 44 = 119 - 44 = 75. This works!
So, the equation is (54 - 29) + 94 - 44 = 75.

Let's verify this third solution:
Numbers used: 54, 29, 94, 44 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: -, +, - (basic arithmetic operations)
Result: 75

Order of operations:
Parentheses first:
54 - 29 = 25
Then addition and subtraction from left to right:
25 + 94 = 119
119 - 44 = 75

This is also a valid solution. I have found three valid solutions:
1. (94 + 54) - 29 - 44 = 75
2. (94 - 44) + 54 - 29 = 75
3. (54 - 29) + 94 - 44 = 75

I will present the first one I found.

3.  Let's try starting with 60.

Both are valid. I will present one of them. The second one seems slightly more straightforward in terms of order of operations.

Let's double check the requirements:
- Combine numbers [62 60 92]
- Use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Achieve target 30
- Each number used once
- Place all intermediate thoughts and calculations inside <think></think> tags.
- Provide the final equation within <answer></answer> tags.
- No other text.

I have found two valid solutions:
1.  (62 + 60) - 92 = 30
2.  60 - (92 - 62) = 30

I will choose the first one for the final answer.

3201,1357,"<think>The target value is 38. The available numbers are 74, 21, and 57. I need to use each number exactly once with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Let's explore combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (74):**
    *   74 - ? = 38. This means ? = 74 - 38 = 36. Can I make 36 from 21 and 57?
        *   21 + 57 = 78 (No)
        *   57 - 21 = 36 (Yes!)
        *   So, 74 - (57 - 21) = 74 - 36 = 38. This looks like a valid solution.

2.  **Let's try another approach to confirm or find alternatives.**
    *   What if I multiply? 74 * 21 is too large. 74 * 57 is too large. 21 * 57 is too large.
    *   What if I divide? 74 / 21 (not an integer). 74 / 57 (not an integer). 21 / 74 (small fraction). 21 / 57 (small fraction). 57 / 74 (small fraction). 57 / 21 (not an integer). Division is unlikely to be the primary operation leading to 38 from these numbers unless it's part of a larger expression.

3.  **Consider other subtractions from 74:**
    *   74 - 21 = 53. Can I get 38 from 53 and 57?
        *   53 + 57 = 110 (No)
        *   57 - 53 = 4 (No)
        *   53 - 57 = -4 (No)
    *   74 - 57 = 17. Can I get 38 from 17 and 21?
        *   17 + 21 = 38 (Yes!)
        *   So, (74 - 57) + 21 = 17 + 21 = 38. This is another valid solution.

4.  **Consider starting with 57:**
    *   57 - ? = 38. ? = 57 - 38 = 19. Can I make 19 from 74 and 21?
        *   74 - 21 = 53 (No)
        *   21 - 74 = -53 (No)
        *   74 + 21 = 95 (No)
    *   57 + ? = 38. ? = 38 - 57 = -19. Can I make -19 from 74 and 21?
        *   21 - 74 = -53 (No)
        *   74 - 21 = 53 (No)

5.  **Consider starting with 21:**
    *   21 + ? = 38. ? = 38 - 21 = 17. Can I make 17 from 74 and 57?
        *   74 - 57 = 17 (Yes!)
        *   So, 21 + (74 - 57) = 21 + 17 = 38. This is the same as solution 3, just reordered.

Both `74 - (57 - 21)` and `(74 - 57) + 21` work. The prompt asks for *an* equation. I'll present the second one as it might be slightly simpler to read.

Let's double check the second solution:
Numbers used: 74, 57, 21 (all used once).
Operations used: subtraction, addition (allowed).
Result: (74 - 57) + 21 = 17 + 21 = 38. Correct.

Let's double check the first solution:
Numbers used: 74, 57, 21 (all used once).
Operations used: subtraction, subtraction (allowed).
Result: 74 - (57 - 21) = 74 - 36 = 38. Correct.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 67, 19, and 75 exactly once, with only standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to produce the result 27.

Let's list the numbers: [67, 19, 75]
Target: 27

I need to try different combinations of operations and order of operations.

Possible combinations of two numbers and an operation:
1. 67 + 19 = 86
2. 67 - 19 = 48
3. 67 * 19 = 1273
4. 67 / 19 = (not an integer, likely not useful unless it cancels out later)
5. 19 + 67 = 86 (same as 1)
6. 19 - 67 = -48
7. 19 * 67 = 1273 (same as 3)
8. 19 / 67 = (fraction)
9. 67 + 75 = 142
10. 67 - 75 = -8
11. 67 * 75 = 5025
12. 67 / 75 = (fraction)
13. 75 + 67 = 142 (same as 9)
14. 75 - 67 = 8
15. 75 * 67 = 5025 (same as 11)
16. 75 / 67 = (fraction)
17. 19 + 75 = 94
18. 19 - 75 = -56
19. 19 * 75 = 1425
20. 19 / 75 = (fraction)
21. 75 + 19 = 94 (same as 17)
22. 75 - 19 = 56
23. 75 * 19 = 1425 (same as 19)
24. 75 / 19 = (not an integer, 3.947...)

Now, let's take the results from these operations and combine them with the remaining number.

Scenario 1: Start with 67 and 19.
- (67 + 19) = 86. Remaining number is 75.
  - 86 + 75 = 161 (not 27)
  - 86 - 75 = 11 (not 27)
  - 75 - 86 = -11 (not 27)
  - 86 * 75 = 6450 (not 27)
  - 86 / 75 = (fraction)
  - 75 / 86 = (fraction)
- (67 - 19) = 48. Remaining number is 75.
  - 48 + 75 = 123 (not 27)
  - 48 - 75 = -27 (close, but negative)
  - 75 - 48 = 27. This is a potential solution! Let's check the numbers used: 67, 19, 75. Operations: -, -. Equation: 75 - (67 - 19) = 75 - 48 = 27. This works.
- (67 * 19) = 1273. Remaining number is 75.
  - 1273 + 75 = 1348
  - 1273 - 75 = 1198
  - 75 - 1273 = -1198
  - 1273 * 75 = large
  - 1273 / 75 = fraction
  - 75 / 1273 = fraction

Scenario 2: Start with 67 and 75.
- (67 + 75) = 142. Remaining number is 19.
  - 142 + 19 = 161
  - 142 - 19 = 123
  - 19 - 142 = -123
  - 142 * 19 = large
  - 142 / 19 = fraction
  - 19 / 142 = fraction
- (67 - 75) = -8. Remaining number is 19.
  - -8 + 19 = 11
  - -8 - 19 = -27 (close, but negative)
  - 19 - (-8) = 19 + 8 = 27. This is another potential solution! Numbers used: 67, 75, 19. Operations: -, +. Equation: 19 - (67 - 75) = 19 - (-8) = 19 + 8 = 27. This also works.
- (75 - 67) = 8. Remaining number is 19.
  - 8 + 19 = 27. This is a third potential solution! Numbers used: 75, 67, 19. Operations: -, +. Equation: (75 - 67) + 19 = 8 + 19 = 27. This works.

Scenario 3: Start with 19 and 75.
- (19 + 75) = 94. Remaining number is 67.
  - 94 + 67 = 161
  - 94 - 67 = 27. This is a fourth potential solution! Numbers used: 19, 75, 67. Operations: +, -. Equation: (19 + 75) - 67 = 94 - 67 = 27. This works.
- (19 - 75) = -56. Remaining number is 67.
  - -56 + 67 = 11
  - -56 - 67 = -123
  - 67 - (-56) = 67 + 56 = 123
- (75 - 19) = 56. Remaining number is 67.
  - 56 + 67 = 123
  - 56 - 67 = -11
  - 67 - 56 = 11

Let's re-evaluate the solutions found:
1. 75 - (67 - 19) = 27
2. 19 - (67 - 75) = 27
3. (75 - 67) + 19 = 27
4. (19 + 75) - 67 = 27

All these solutions use the numbers 67, 19, and 75 exactly once and only standard operations. I will pick one to present. The simplest looking one is (75 - 67) + 19.

Let's double check (75 - 67) + 19:
- Numbers used: 75, 67, 19. All used exactly once.
- Operations used: -, +. Standard operations.
- Calculation:
  - 75 - 67 = 8
  - 8 + 19 = 27
- Target reached: 27.

This equation is correct.

Let's check another one, for example (19 + 75) - 67:
- Numbers used: 19, 75, 67. All used exactly once.
- Operations used: +, -. Standard operations.
- Calculation:
  - 19 + 75 = 94
  - 94 - 67 = 27
- Target reached: 27.

This is also correct. I will present (75 - 67) + 19.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 12, 23, 76, and 31 to reach the target number 80.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Start with the largest number, 76.
    *   76 + ? = 80. Need 4. Can I make 4 from 12, 23, 31? No.
    *   76 - ? = 80. Need -4. Can I make -4 from 12, 23, 31? No.
    *   76 * ? = 80. Not possible with integers.
    *   76 / ? = 80. Not possible with integers.

2.  Try combining numbers to get close to 80.
    *   76 + 12 = 88. Need to subtract 8 using 23 and 31. (31 - 23 = 8).
        So, 76 + 12 - (31 - 23) = 88 - 8 = 80.
        This uses all numbers: 76, 12, 31, 23.
        Let's check the order of operations.
        76 + 12 - (31 - 23) = 76 + 12 - 8 = 88 - 8 = 80.
        This works.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
*   Maybe multiplication first?
    *   12 * ?
    *   23 * ?
    *   31 * ?
    *   76 * ?

*   Let's try to make a number that, when added/subtracted from another, gets to 80.
    *   (31 * 2) + 12 + ? No, 2 is not in the list.
    *   (31 * 3) - ? No, 3 is not in the list.

*   Let's go back to the successful one: 76 + 12 - (31 - 23) = 80.
    This is a valid equation.

Let's try to rearrange it slightly if possible, but the current one is good.
(76 + 12) - (31 - 23) = 80
88 - 8 = 80.

What about other combinations?
*   (76 - 12) + (31 - 23) = 64 + 8 = 72. No.
*   (76 + 23) - (31 + 12) = 99 - 43 = 56. No.
*   (76 - 23) + (31 - 12) = 53 + 19 = 72. No.
*   (76 + 31) - (23 + 12) = 107 - 35 = 72. No.
*   (76 - 31) + (23 - 12) = 45 + 11 = 56. No.

*   Try division:
    *   76 / 12? Not integer.
    *   76 / 23? Not integer.
    *   76 / 31? Not integer.
    *   12 / ?
    *   23 / ?
    *   31 / ?

*   Let's try multiplication with smaller numbers first.
    *   12 * 23 = 276. Too big.
    *   12 * 31 = 372. Too big.
    *   12 * 76 = 912. Too big.
    *   23 * 31 = 713. Too big.

*   Let's try to make a number close to 80 using multiplication and then adjust.
    *   (12 * ?) + ? + ? = 80
    *   (23 * ?) + ? + ? = 80
    *   (31 * ?) + ? + ? = 80

*   Consider (31 * 2) - this is not allowed as 2 is not in the list.

*   Let's re-evaluate the first successful attempt: 76 + 12 - (31 - 23) = 80.
    This is a perfectly valid solution.

Let's try to find another one just in case.
*   What if we try to make 80 directly?
    *   (31 * 3) - 13? No.
    *   (23 * 3) + 11? No.

*   Let's try to make a number that divides nicely.
    *   (76 + 12 + 23 + 31) = 142.
    *   (76 + 12 + 23) - 31 = 111 - 31 = 80.
        This uses 76, 12, 23, 31.
        Let's check: 76 + 12 + 23 - 31 = 88 + 23 - 31 = 111 - 31 = 80.
        This is another valid solution.

I have found two valid solutions:
1.  76 + 12 - (31 - 23) = 80
2.  76 + 12 + 23 - 31 = 80

The second one is simpler. I will use that one.
76 + 12 + 23 - 31 = 80.
All numbers [12, 23, 76, 31] are used exactly once.
Operations are +, +, -.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 22, 97, 4, and 95 exactly once, with basic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target number 86.

Let's list the numbers: [22, 97, 4, 95]
Target: 86

I need to try different combinations and operations.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust.
2. Try to get close to 86 with two numbers and then use the others.
3. Consider division as it can significantly change the magnitude.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.
(97 * 4) = 388. Too large.
(95 * 4) = 380. Too large.
(97 * 22) = 2134. Too large.
(95 * 22) = 2090. Too large.

Attempt 2: Using subtraction with large numbers.
97 - 22 = 75. Remaining numbers: [4, 95]. Target from 75: 86 - 75 = 11. Can I get 11 from 4 and 95? No simple way.
97 - 4 = 93. Remaining numbers: [22, 95]. Target from 93: 86 - 93 = -7. Can I get -7 from 22 and 95? No simple way.
97 - 95 = 2. Remaining numbers: [22, 4]. Target from 2: 86 - 2 = 84. Can I get 84 from 22 and 4? 22 * 4 = 88. Close. 22 * 4 - 2 = 86. This uses 22, 4, and 2. But I need to use 97 and 95 to get 2. So, (97 - 95) = 2. Then 22 * 4 = 88. 88 - 2 = 86. This works!
Let's check: (22 * 4) - (97 - 95) = 88 - 2 = 86.
This uses 22, 4, 97, and 95 exactly once.

Let's verify the operations and numbers:
Numbers used: 22, 4, 97, 95. All used exactly once.
Operations used: *, -, -. Basic operations.
Result: 86.

Let's try another path to be sure.

Attempt 3: Using addition first.
97 + 22 = 119. Remaining: [4, 95]. Target from 119: 86 - 119 = -33. Can I get -33 from 4 and 95? No.
97 + 4 = 101. Remaining: [22, 95]. Target from 101: 86 - 101 = -15. Can I get -15 from 22 and 95? No.
97 + 95 = 192. Too large.
22 + 4 = 26. Remaining: [97, 95]. Target from 26: 86 - 26 = 60. Can I get 60 from 97 and 95? 97 - 95 = 2. No.
22 + 95 = 117. Remaining: [97, 4]. Target from 117: 86 - 117 = -31. Can I get -31 from 97 and 4? No.
4 + 95 = 99. Remaining: [22, 97]. Target from 99: 86 - 99 = -13. Can I get -13 from 22 and 97? No.

Attempt 4: Using division.
95 / ? Not easily divisible by 22 or 4 to get a whole number.
97 / ? Not easily divisible.
22 / ? Not easily divisible.
4 / ? Not easily divisible.

Let's revisit the successful attempt: (22 * 4) - (97 - 95) = 86.
This seems like a valid solution.

Let's try to rearrange it slightly.
Could it be 97 - (something)?
97 - X = 86 => X = 11. Can I get 11 from [22, 4, 95]?
(95 / ?) No.
(22 - ?) No.
(4 * ?) No.
(22 + 4) = 26.
(22 - 4) = 18.
(4 - 22) = -18.
(22 * 4) = 88.

The user wants me to create a mathematical equation using the numbers 89, 47, and 65 exactly once, and the operations +, -, *, /. The target value is 71.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations to reach 71.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 89, N2 = 47, N3 = 65.
Target = 71.

Possible structures:
1. (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3
2. N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Let's try combinations systematically.

**Attempt 1: Using 89 first**

*   (89 + 47) + 65 = 136 + 65 = 201 (Too high)
*   (89 + 47) - 65 = 136 - 65 = 71 (Found it!)

Let's verify this.
Numbers used: 89, 47, 65 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic).
Result: 71 (target value).

This looks like a valid solution. I should still explore other possibilities to be thorough, but this one is straightforward.

Let's try another order just to confirm.

*   (89 - 47) + 65 = 42 + 65 = 107 (Not 71)
*   (89 - 47) - 65 = 42 - 65 = -23 (Not 71)
*   (89 * 47) + 65 = 4183 + 65 = 4248 (Too high)
*   (89 * 47) - 65 = 4183 - 65 = 4118 (Too high)
*   (89 / 47) + 65 = (approx 1.89) + 65 = 66.89 (Not 71, and division might lead to non-integers which is usually avoided unless specified)
*   (89 / 47) - 65 = (approx 1.89) - 65 = -63.11 (Not 71)

*   89 + (47 + 65) = 89 + 112 = 201 (Same as first one)
*   89 + (47 - 65) = 89 + (-18) = 71 (Found another one!)
    Numbers used: 89, 47, 65 (all used exactly once).
    Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic).
    Result: 71 (target value).
    This is also a valid solution. (89 + (47 - 65)) is equivalent to 89 + 47 - 65 due to associativity of addition/subtraction.

*   89 - (47 + 65) = 89 - 112 = -23 (Not 71)

*   89 / (47 + 65) = 89 / 112 (Not 71)
*   89 / (47 - 65) = 89 / (-18) (Not 71)

    Numbers used: 47, 89, 65 (all used exactly once).

    Result: 71 (target value).
    This is also a valid solution. (47 + (89 - 65))

677,1808,"<think>The problem asks us to find an equation using the numbers [92, 16, 52, 36] and the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to arrive at the result 92. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 92, 16, 52, 36.
The target is 92.

We need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.

One of the numbers is already 92. This suggests that we might be able to isolate 92 by performing operations on the other three numbers that result in 0, or by performing operations that result in 1 and then multiplying by 92, or by performing operations that result in 92 directly.

Let's consider the possibility of making the other three numbers (16, 52, 36) combine to 0.
If we can get 0 from 16, 52, and 36, then we can add it to 92.
Possible combinations for 0:
- (a - b) + c = 0?
- (a + b) - c = 0?
- a - (b + c) = 0?
- a * b - c = 0? (Unlikely with these numbers)
- a / b - c = 0? (Unlikely with these numbers)

Let's try to combine 16, 52, and 36.
Sum of 16, 52, 36 = 16 + 52 + 36 = 68 + 36 = 104.
Difference between two numbers:
52 - 16 = 36. If we have 52 - 16, we get 36. Then we have 36 and 36. We can do 36 - 36 = 0.
So, (52 - 16) - 36 = 36 - 36 = 0.
This uses 52, 16, and 36.
Now, we can add this result to 92.
Equation: 92 + ((52 - 16) - 36)
Let's check: 92 + (36 - 36) = 92 + 0 = 92.
This equation uses all numbers [92, 16, 52, 36] exactly once and only uses basic arithmetic operations.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

What if we try to make the other numbers combine to 1 and multiply by 92?
We need to get 1 from 16, 52, 36. This seems difficult with basic operations. For example, 36 / (52 - 16) = 36 / 36 = 1. This uses 36, 52, 16.
Then we could do 92 * (36 / (52 - 16)).
Let's check: 92 * (36 / 36) = 92 * 1 = 92.
This also works and uses all numbers and operations correctly.

What if we try to make the other numbers combine to 92?
We need to get 92 from 16, 52, 36.
16 + 52 + 36 = 104 (too high)
52 + 36 - 16 = 88 - 16 = 72 (too low)
52 + 16 + 36 = 104
52 * ?
36 * ?
16 * ?

Let's consider the first solution found: 92 + ((52 - 16) - 36).
Numbers used: 92, 52, 16, 36. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, -. All basic.
Result: 92 + (36 - 36) = 92 + 0 = 92. Correct.

Let's consider the second solution found: 92 * (36 / (52 - 16)).
Numbers used: 92, 36, 52, 16. All used once.
Operations used: *, /, -. All basic.
Result: 92 * (36 / 36) = 92 * 1 = 92. Correct.

Both solutions are valid. The problem asks for ""an equation"". I will present the first one found as it seems slightly simpler in terms of order of operations.

Let's re-verify the first solution carefully.
Numbers: [92, 16, 52, 36]
Target: 92
Equation: 92 + ((52 - 16) - 36)

Step 1: Calculate the innermost parenthesis.
52 - 16 = 36.
Intermediate result: 36. Numbers used: 52, 16.

Step 2: Use the result from Step 1 and the next number.
36 - 36 = 0.
Intermediate result: 0. Numbers used: 52, 16, 36.

Step 3: Use the result from Step 2 and the remaining number.
92 + 0 = 92.
Final result: 92. Numbers used: 92, 52, 16, 36.

All numbers are used exactly once.
Only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *) are used.
The final result is 92.

The equation is 92 + ((52 - 16) - 36).
The parentheses are important for defining the order of operations.

Let's consider the second solution again: 92 * (36 / (52 - 16)).
Step 1: Calculate the innermost parenthesis.
52 - 16 = 36.
Intermediate result: 36. Numbers used: 52, 16.

Step 2: Use the result from Step 1 and the next number.
36 / 36 = 1.
Intermediate result: 1. Numbers used: 52, 16, 36.

Step 3: Use the result from Step 2 and the remaining number.
92 * 1 = 92.
Final result: 92. Numbers used: 92, 52, 16, 36.

This is also a valid solution. I will stick with the first one as it was derived first and is straightforward.
The problem statement does not specify any preference for the complexity or type of operations used, as long as they are basic and each number is used once.

Final check of the chosen equation: 92 + ((52 - 16) - 36)
Numbers: 92, 16, 52, 36. All present and used once.
Operations: +, -, -. All basic.
Evaluation:
(52 - 16) = 36
(36 - 36) = 0
92 + 0 = 92.
The equation is correct.

1.  (44 + 10) - 13 = 54 - 13 = 41. This works!
2.  (44 - 10) + 13 = 34 + 13 = 47. No.
3.  (44 * 10) - 13 = 440 - 13 = 427. No.
4.  (44 / 10) + 13 = 4.4 + 13 = 17.4. No.
5.  44 + (10 - 13) = 44 + (-3) = 41. This also works!
6.  44 - (10 + 13) = 44 - 23 = 21. No.
7.  44 - (13 - 10) = 44 - 3 = 41. This also works!
8.  (10 + 13) - 44 = 23 - 44 = -21. No.
9.  (13 + 10) - 44 = 23 - 44 = -21. No.
10. (10 * 13) - 44 = 130 - 44 = 86. No.
11. (44 + 13) - 10 = 57 - 10 = 47. No.
12. 10 + (44 - 13) = 10 + 31 = 41. This also works!
13. 13 + (44 - 10) = 13 + 34 = 47. No.
14. 10 - (44 - 13) = 10 - 31 = -21. No.
15. 13 - (44 - 10) = 13 - 34 = -21. No.

I have found several valid equations:
(44 + 10) - 13 = 41
44 + (10 - 13) = 41
44 - (13 - 10) = 41
10 + (44 - 13) = 41

2629,219,"<think>The target number is 54. The available numbers are 10, 50, 9, and 1. I need to use each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's consider the larger numbers first, 50 and 10.
If I add them, I get 60. Then I need to get from 60 to 54 using 9 and 1. 60 - 9 - 1 = 50, not 54. 60 - (9+1) = 50. 60 - 9 + 1 = 52. 60 + 9 - 1 = 68. 60 + 9 + 1 = 70. 60 * 9 = 540. 60 / 9 is not an integer.

If I subtract 10 from 50, I get 40. Then I need to get from 40 to 54 using 9 and 1.
40 + 9 + 1 = 50.
40 + 9 - 1 = 48.
40 - 9 + 1 = 32.
40 - 9 - 1 = 30.
40 * 9 = 360.
40 / 9 is not an integer.

If I multiply 50 by 10, I get 500. This is too large.
If I divide 50 by 10, I get 5. Then I need to get from 5 to 54 using 9 and 1.
5 + 9 + 1 = 15.
5 + 9 - 1 = 13.
5 - 9 + 1 = -3.
5 * 9 = 45. Then 45 + 1 = 46 or 45 - 1 = 44. Not 54.
5 * 1 = 5. Then 5 + 9 = 14 or 5 - 9 = -4.

Let's try combining 9 and 1 first.
9 + 1 = 10. Now I have 10, 50, 10. I can't use 10 twice. This means the 10 from 9+1 is a new number. So I have 50, 10, and the result of 9+1 which is 10. This is not allowed as I must use the original numbers.

Let's try combining 9 and 1 in other ways.
9 - 1 = 8. Now I have 10, 50, 8.
50 + 10 - 8 = 52.
50 + 10 + 8 = 68.
50 - 10 + 8 = 48.
50 * 8 = 400.
50 / 10 = 5. Then 5 + 8 = 13. 5 * 8 = 40.

9 * 1 = 9. Now I have 10, 50, 9.
50 + 10 - 9 = 51.
50 + 10 + 9 = 69.
50 - 10 + 9 = 49.
50 * 9 = 450.
50 / 10 = 5. Then 5 + 9 = 14. 5 * 9 = 45.

9 / 1 = 9. Same as above.

Let's try using multiplication with the larger numbers.
If I multiply 9 by something, maybe I can get close to 54.
9 * 6 = 54. Can I make 6 from 10, 50, 1?
10 - 1 = 9. Not 6.
10 / ?
50 / 10 = 5. Not 6.
50 / ?

What if I use 50 and 9?
50 + 9 = 59. Need to get from 59 to 54 using 10 and 1. 59 - 10 + 1 = 50. 59 - 10 - 1 = 48. 59 + 10 + 1 = 70. 59 + 10 - 1 = 68.
50 - 9 = 41. Need to get from 41 to 54 using 10 and 1. 41 + 10 + 1 = 52. 41 + 10 - 1 = 50. 41 - 10 + 1 = 32. 41 - 10 - 1 = 30.
50 * 9 = 450. Too big.
50 / 9 is not integer.

What if I use 10 and 9?
10 * 9 = 90. Need to get from 90 to 54 using 50 and 1.
90 - 50 + 1 = 41.
90 - 50 - 1 = 39.
90 + 50 + 1 = 141.
90 + 50 - 1 = 139.

Let's try a structure like (A * B) + C + D or (A * B) - C - D.
Consider 9 * 5 = 45. Can I make 5 from 10, 50, 1? Yes, 50 / 10 = 5.
So, (50 / 10) * 9 = 5 * 9 = 45.
Now I have used 50, 10, and 9. I have 1 left.
I need to get from 45 to 54 using 1.
45 + 1 = 46. Not 54.

Let's try (A + B) * C + D.
(10 + 1) * 5 = 11 * 5 = 55. Need to get from 55 to 54 using 9. 55 - 9 = 46.
(10 + 9) * 1 = 19. Need to get from 19 to 54 using 50. 19 + 50 = 69. 50 - 19 = 31.
(50 + 1) * 1 = 51. Need to get from 51 to 54 using 10 and 9. 51 + 10 - 9 = 52. 51 - 10 + 9 = 50.
(50 + 9) * 1 = 59. Need to get from 59 to 54 using 10. 59 - 10 = 49.

Let's try (A - B) * C + D.
(10 - 1) * 5 = 9 * 5 = 45. Need to get from 45 to 54 using 9. 45 + 9 = 54.
This uses 10, 1, 50 (to make 5), and 9.
The expression would be (10 - 1) * (50 / 10) + 9. This uses 10, 1, 50, 10, 9. The number 10 is used twice. Not allowed.

Let's rethink the structure.
Maybe something like 50 + (something).
50 + 4 = 54. Can I make 4 from 10, 9, 1?
10 - 9 + 1 = 2.
10 - 9 - 1 = 0.
10 + 1 - 9 = 2.
9 - 10 + 1 = 0.
9 + 1 - 10 = 0.
10 / ?

Maybe something like 50 - (something).
50 - (-4) = 54. Can I make -4 from 10, 9, 1?
1 - 10 + 9 = 0.
1 - 9 + 10 = 2.
9 - 10 - 1 = -2.
1 - (10 - 9) = 1 - 1 = 0.

Let's try 10 * 5 = 50. Then I have 50, 9, 1.
50 + 9 - 1 = 58.

<think>What about multiplication? 34 * 4 = 136. Too large. 24 * 4 = 96. Close to 81.</think>
<think>If I have 96, I need to subtract 15. Can I make 15 from 34 and 95?</think>
<think>95 - 34 = 61. No.</think>
<think>What about division? 95 / ? Not likely to result in a whole number that helps easily.</think>
<think>Let's go back to the first successful attempt: 95 - (34 - 24 + 4) = 81.</think>
<think>The order of operations within the parenthesis matters. (34 - 24) + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14. This is correct.</think>
<think>What if the parenthesis were different? 34 - (24 + 4) = 34 - 28 = 6. Then 95 - 6 = 89. Not 81.</think>
<think>So, 95 - (34 - 24 + 4) is a valid solution.</think>
<think>Let's try another structure. Maybe (A * B) + C - D or similar.</think>

39,1090,"<think>The target number is 34. The available numbers are 59, 41, and 66.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 66.
If we subtract 41 from 66, we get 66 - 41 = 25.
We need to get from 25 to 34 using 59. This doesn't seem straightforward. 25 + 59 = 84, 59 - 25 = 34. This works!
So, (59 - (66 - 41)) = 59 - 25 = 34.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 59, 66, 41. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, -. Yes.

Possibility 2: Start with 59.
59 - 41 = 18. We need to get to 34 using 66. 18 + 66 = 84, 66 - 18 = 48. Not 34.
59 + 41 = 100. We need to get to 34 using 66. 100 - 66 = 34. This works!
So, (59 + 41) - 66 = 100 - 66 = 34.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 59, 41, 66. Yes.
Let's check the operations: +, -. Yes.

Possibility 3: Start with 41.
41 - 59 = -18. We need to get to 34 using 66. -18 + 66 = 48. Not 34.
41 + 59 = 100. We need to get to 34 using 66. 100 - 66 = 34. This is the same as Possibility 2.
41 - 66 = -25. We need to get to 34 using 59. -25 + 59 = 34. This works!
So, (41 - 66) + 59 = -25 + 59 = 34.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 41, 66, 59. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, +. Yes.

Possibility 4: Using multiplication or division.
Let's try to get a number close to 34 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the third.
59 * 41 is too large.
59 / 41 is not an integer.
41 / 59 is not an integer.
66 / 41 is not an integer.
66 / 59 is not an integer.
59 * 66 is too large.
41 * 66 is too large.

Let's try division to get smaller numbers.
If we divide 66 by something, it's unlikely to help.
What if we try to make one of the numbers smaller first?
(66 - 59) = 7. Then use 41. 7 * 41 = 287. 41 - 7 = 34. This works!
So, 41 - (66 - 59) = 41 - 7 = 34.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 41, 66, 59. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, -. Yes.

We have found multiple valid equations. The simplest ones are usually preferred.
(59 + 41) - 66 = 34
41 - (66 - 59) = 34
59 - (66 - 41) = 34
(41 - 66) + 59 = 34

Let's pick (59 + 41) - 66 = 34 as it's straightforward.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 71, 21, and 43, and the operations +, -, *, /. Each number must be used exactly once. The target result is 93.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with multiplication:**
    *   71 * 21 = 1491 (too large)
    *   71 * 43 = 3053 (too large)
    *   21 * 43 = 903 (too large)

    This suggests multiplication might not be the first operation, or it might be used with division to reduce the numbers.

2.  **Try addition/subtraction first:**
    *   71 + 21 = 92. We need 93. We have 43 left.
        *   92 + 43 = 135 (too large)
        *   92 - 43 = 49 (too small)
        *   43 - 92 = -49 (too small)
        *   92 * 43 (too large)
        *   92 / 43 (not an integer)
        *   43 / 92 (not an integer)

    *   71 - 21 = 50. We need 93. We have 43 left.
        *   50 + 43 = 93. This works!
        *   Equation: (71 - 21) + 43 = 50 + 43 = 93.
        *   Numbers used: 71, 21, 43 (all used once).
        *   Operations used: -, + (allowed).
        *   Result: 93.

Let's double-check this solution.
Equation: (71 - 21) + 43
Step 1: 71 - 21 = 50
Step 2: 50 + 43 = 93
The equation uses all numbers [71, 21, 43] exactly once.
It uses only allowed operations (+, -).
It evaluates to 93.

This seems to be the correct equation.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 26, 63, and 4 to reach the target number 93.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:
1. (26 + 63) + 4 = 89 + 4 = 93. This works!
2. (63 + 26) + 4 = 89 + 4 = 93. Same as above.
3. 63 + (26 + 4) = 63 + 30 = 93. This also works.
4. 26 + 63 + 4 = 93. This is the simplest form.

Let's check other operations just in case, but addition seems straightforward.
- Multiplication: 26 * 4 = 104. 104 + 63 = 167 (too high). 104 - 63 = 41 (too low).
- Division: 63 / ? (not easily divisible by 26 or 4 to get a whole number). 26 / ? (not easily divisible by 63 or 4). 4 / ? (not easily divisible).

The simplest and most direct solution is using addition.
The equation 26 + 63 + 4 = 93 uses all numbers once and reaches the target.
Another valid equation is 63 + (26 + 4) = 93.
Or (63 + 26) + 4 = 93.

I will output the simplest one: 26 + 63 + 4 = 93.

<answer>26 + 63 + 4 = 93</answer>",1.0,
3383,1836,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 76, 71, and 80 exactly once, along with the operators +, -, *, and / to achieve a result of 16. I need to explore different combinations and order of operations.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 76, N2 = 71, N3 = 80.
Target: 16.

Possible structures:
1. (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3
2. N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Let's try combinations systematically.

Attempt 1: Start with multiplication or division as they tend to change the magnitude significantly.

Try division first:
- 76 / 71 is not an integer.
- 76 / 80 is not an integer.
- 71 / 76 is not an integer.
- 71 / 80 is not an integer.
- 80 / 76 is not an integer.
- 80 / 71 is not an integer.

This suggests that division might not be the first operation, or it might be used in a way that results in an integer later.

Let's try multiplication:
- 76 * 71 = 5396 (too large)
- 76 * 80 = 6080 (too large)
- 71 * 80 = 5680 (too large)

This implies that multiplication is unlikely to be the first operation unless it's followed by a large division.

Let's try addition and subtraction first.

Consider (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3:

Case 1: (76 + 71) op2 80

This uses 80, 76, and 71 exactly once.
The operators used are / and -.
The result is 16.

Let's check other possibilities just in case.

Let's try to combine the numbers.
We have a large number (97) and a number close to it (69).
97 - 69 = 28.
We need to get 61 from 21 and 12 and combine it with 28.
21 + 12 = 33.
28 + 33 = 61.
So, (97 - 69) + (21 + 12) = 28 + 33 = 61.
This uses all numbers exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's check other combinations.
Maybe start with 97.
97 - ? = 61. ? = 36.
Can we get 36 from 21, 12, 69?
21 + 12 = 33. Not 36.
69 - 21 - 12 = 69 - 33 = 36.
So, 97 - (69 - 21 - 12) = 97 - (48 - 12) = 97 - 36 = 61.
This also works.

Let's try starting with 69.
69 - ? = 61. ? = 8.
Can we get 8 from 21, 12, 97?
97 - 21 - 12 = 97 - 33 = 64. Not 8.
(97 - 21) / 12 = 76 / 12 (not an integer).
(97 - 12) / 21 = 85 / 21 (not an integer).
21 - 12 = 9. Close to 8.
97 / ?

Let's try multiplication.
21 * 12 = 252. Too large.
69 * 12 = 828. Too large.
97 * 12 = 1164. Too large.
21 * 69 = 1449. Too large.
21 * 97 = 2037. Too large.
12 * 69 = 828. Too large.
12 * 97 = 1164. Too large.
69 * 97 = 6693. Too large.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: (97 - 69) + (21 + 12) = 61.
This is a valid solution.

Let's check the second successful attempt: 97 - (69 - 21 - 12) = 61.
This is also a valid solution.

I will present the first one as it seems slightly simpler.
(97 - 69) + (21 + 12)
97 - 69 = 28
21 + 12 = 33
28 + 33 = 61.
All numbers used: 97, 69, 21, 12.
Operations used: -, +, +.
Result: 61.

Let's consider the order of operations. Parentheses are important.
(97 - 69) + (21 + 12) = 61.

Another possibility:
97 + 12 = 109
69 - 21 = 48
109 - 48 = 61.
So, (97 + 12) - (69 - 21) = 109 - 48 = 61.
This also works.

Let's try another one:
69 + 12 = 81
97 - 21 = 76
81 - 76 = 5. Not 61.

How about division?
69 / 21 (not integer)
69 / 12 (not integer)
97 / 21 (not integer)
97 / 12 (not integer)
21 / 12 (not integer)
12 / 21 (not integer)
69 / 97 (not integer)
12 / 97 (not integer)
21 / 97 (not integer)

Let's try combining division with other operations.
(97 + 21) / ? = 61. 118 / ? = 61. No.
(97 - 21) / ? = 61. 76 / ? = 61. No.
(69 + 12) / ? = 61. 81 / ? = 61. No.
(69 - 12) / ? = 61. 57 / ? = 61. No.

Let's try division as the last step.
(21 + 12 + 69 + 97) / ? = 61. (200 - 1) / ? = 61. 199 / ? = 61. No.

Let's try division earlier.
Maybe one of the numbers is a divisor.
(97 + 12) / 21 = 109 / 21 (not integer)
(97 - 12) / 21 = 85 / 21 (not integer)
(69 + 21) / 12 = 90 / 12 (not integer)
(69 - 21) / 12 = 48 / 12 = 4.
We have 4, and we have 97. We need to get 61.
4 + 97 = 101.
97 - 4 = 93.
4 * 97 = 388.
97 / 4 (not integer).
So, (69 - 21) / 12 = 4. We used 69, 21, 12. We have 97 left.
We need to combine 4 and 97 to get 61. This is not possible with basic operations.

Let's re-evaluate the successful ones.
1. (97 - 69) + (21 + 12) = 61
2. 97 - (69 - 21 - 12) = 61
3. (97 + 12) - (69 - 21) = 61

All three are valid. I will pick the first one.
(97 - 69) + (21 + 12)
Check:
97 - 69 = 28
21 + 12 = 33

The problem asks us to use the numbers [84, 80, 11, 56] exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target value of 71.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: {84, 80, 11, 56}
Target: 71

We need to explore different combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if we can get close to the target.
2. Try to create intermediate numbers that, when combined with the remaining numbers, lead to the target.
3. Consider the parity of the numbers and the target. 71 is odd.
   - 84 (even), 80 (even), 11 (odd), 56 (even).
   - To get an odd number, we generally need an odd number of odd numbers in additions/subtractions, or multiplication involving an odd number.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.
- 84 * 11 = 924 (too large)
- 84 * 56 (too large)
- 80 * 11 = 880 (too large)
- 80 * 56 (too large)
- 11 * 56 = 616 (too large)

This suggests that direct multiplication of two large numbers is unlikely to work unless we divide later.

Attempt 2: Using division.
- 84 / 11 (not an integer)
- 84 / 56 (not an integer)
- 80 / 11 (not an integer)
- 80 / 56 (not an integer)
- 56 / 11 (not an integer)
- 56 / 84 (not an integer)
- 84 / 80 (not an integer)
- 11 / 84 (not an integer)
- 11 / 80 (not an integer)
- 11 / 56 (not an integer)
- 56 / 80 (not an integer)

This means we can't get simple integer divisions from the start. However, we can have divisions within parentheses.

Let's try to get close to 71.
- 84 - 11 = 73. Remaining numbers are {80, 56}. Can we get -2 from 80 and 56?
  - 80 - 56 = 24 (no)
  - 56 - 80 = -24 (no)
  - 80 + 56 = 136 (no)
  - 80 / 56 (no)
  - 56 / 80 (no)
  - 80 * 56 (no)
  So, (84 - 11) + (something with 80, 56) doesn't seem to work.

- 80 - 11 = 69. Remaining numbers are {84, 56}. Can we get +2 from 84 and 56?
  - 84 - 56 = 28 (no)
  - 56 - 84 = -28 (no)
  - 84 + 56 = 140 (no)
  - 84 / 56 (no)
  - 56 / 84 (no)
  - 84 * 56 (no)
  So, (80 - 11) + (something with 84, 56) doesn't seem to work.

- 84 - 56 = 28. Remaining numbers are {80, 11}. Can we get 71 - 28 = 43 from 80 and 11?
  - 80 - 11 = 69 (no)
  - 80 + 11 = 91 (no)
  - 80 * 11 = 880 (no)
  - 80 / 11 (no)
  - 11 / 80 (no)
  So, (84 - 56) + (something with 80, 11) doesn't seem to work.

- 80 - 56 = 24. Remaining numbers are {84, 11}. Can we get 71 - 24 = 47 from 84 and 11?
  - 84 - 11 = 73 (no)
  - 84 + 11 = 95 (no)
  - 84 * 11 = 924 (no)
  - 84 / 11 (no)
  - 11 / 84 (no)
  So, (80 - 56) + (something with 84, 11) doesn't seem to work.

Let's try combining three numbers first.
- 84 + 80 + 11 = 175 (too large)
- 84 + 80 - 11 = 153 (too large)
- 84 + 80 - 56 = 108 (too large)
- 84 - 80 + 11 = 15. Remaining number is 56. 15 + 56 = 71. This works!
  Equation: (84 - 80 + 11) + 56 = 71.
  Let's check:
  Numbers used: 84, 80, 11, 56. All used exactly once.
  Operations used: -, +, +. Valid.
  Target: 71.
  Calculation: (84 - 80) + 11 + 56 = 4 + 11 + 56 = 15 + 56 = 71.

Let's try another combination to be sure.
- 84 - 80 - 11 = -7. Remaining number is 56. -7 + 56 = 49 (no)
- 84 - 80 - 56 = -52. Remaining number is 11. -52 + 11 = -41 (no)
- 80 - 11 - 56 = 13. Remaining number is 84. 13 + 84 = 97 (no)
- 84 + 11 - 56 = 39. Remaining number is 80. 39 + 80 = 119 (no)
- 84 + 56 - 11 = 129. Remaining number is 80. 129 + 80 = 209 (no)
- 80 + 56 - 11 = 125. Remaining number is 84. 125 + 84 = 209 (no)

Let's consider multiplication with one number.
- 11 * (something with 84, 80, 56)
  - 11 * (84 - 80) = 11 * 4 = 44. Remaining is 56. 44 + 56 = 100 (no)
  - 11 * (80 - 56) = 11 * 24 = 264 (too large)
  - 11 * (84 / 56) - not integer
  - 11 * (56 / 84) - not integer

Let's try division involving intermediate results.
- (84 + 56) / ? = 140 / ?
  - 140 / 11 (not integer)
  - 140 / 80 (not integer)
- (80 + 56) / ? = 136 / ?

The problem requires me to use the numbers 64, 38, 40, and 93 exactly once, along with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 27.

I need to explore different combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations. The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) will be crucial. Parentheses can be used to control the order of operations.

Let's list the numbers: N = {64, 38, 40, 93}. Target value = 27.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op b) op (c op d)
2. ((a op b) op c) op d
3. (a op (b op c)) op d
4. a op ((b op c) op d)
5. a op (b op (c op d))

Let's try some combinations systematically.

**Strategy 1: Try to get close to 27 using two numbers, then adjust with the others.**

*   **Using 64 and 38:**
    *   64 - 38 = 26. This is very close to 27. I need to get +1 from 40 and 93.
        *   Can I get 1 from 40 and 93 using +, -, *, /?
            *   93 - 40 = 53 (No)
            *   93 + 40 = 133 (No)
            *   93 * 40 = 3720 (No)
            *   93 / 40 (Not an integer, unlikely to yield 1 easily)
            *   40 / 93 (No)
        *   What if I combine them differently? (93 op 40) op X = 1.
        *   Let's try to get 1 from (40 op 93).
            *   (40 / 40) = 1, but I need to use 93.
            *   (93 / 93) = 1, but I need to use 40.
            *   Can I make 40 and 93 equal? No.
        *   This path (64 - 38 = 26) seems difficult to adjust by +1 using 40 and 93.

*   **Using 64 and 40:**
    *   64 - 40 = 24. Need +3 from 38 and 93.
        *   93 - 38 = 55 (No)
        *   93 + 38 = 131 (No)
        *   93 / 38 (No)
        *   38 / 93 (No)
    *   64 + 40 = 104. Need -77 from 38 and 93.
        *   93 - 38 = 55 (No)
    *   64 * 40 = 2560 (Too large)
    *   64 / 40 = 1.6 (Not helpful)

*   **Using 64 and 93:**
    *   93 - 64 = 29. Need -2 from 38 and 40.
        *   40 - 38 = 2. So, (93 - 64) - (40 - 38) = 29 - 2 = 27.
        *   Let's check: Numbers used: 93, 64, 40, 38. Operations used: -, -, -. This works!
        *   Equation: (93 - 64) - (40 - 38) = 27.
        *   Let's verify: 93 - 64 = 29. 40 - 38 = 2. 29 - 2 = 27.
        *   All numbers (64, 38, 40, 93) are used exactly once.
        *   Only subtraction is used, which is one of the four fundamental operations.
        *   The result is exactly 27.

This looks like a valid solution. Let me try to explore other possibilities to ensure I'm not missing a simpler or more elegant one, or to confirm this is a robust solution.

**Strategy 2: Try combinations involving multiplication or division early on.**

*   **Consider division:**
    *   Can any number be divided by another to get a useful integer?
        *   64 / ? (No other number divides 64 evenly)
        *   38 / ? (No)
        *   40 / ? (No)
        *   93 / ? (No)
    *   This means division will likely result in fractions or be used in a way that cancels out or leads to an integer later.

*   **Consider multiplication:**
    *   Let's try multiplying two numbers and then adjusting.
    *   38 * ? (Too large quickly)
    *   40 * ? (Too large quickly)
    *   64 * ? (Too large quickly)
    *   What if we multiply by a small number obtained from other numbers?
        *   Example: (40 / 40) = 1. But I need to use all numbers.
        *   Example: (38 / 38) = 1.
        *   Example: (93 / 93) = 1.
        *   Example: (64 / 64) = 1.

    *   Let's try to create a small multiplier or divisor.
    *   Consider (40 / (something)).
    *   Consider (something / 40).

    *   Let's try to get a number close to 27 by multiplying two numbers, then dividing by a third, and adding/subtracting the fourth.
    *   (64 * 38) / 40 ... too large.
    *   (64 * 40) / 38 ... too large.
    *   (64 * 93) / 40 ... too large.

    *   What if we use division to reduce numbers significantly?
    *   Try to make a number that, when operated on with another, gets close to 27.
    *   Consider 93. How can I get 27 from 93?
        *   93 - X = 27 => X = 66. Can I get 66 from {64, 38, 40}?
            *   64 + ? (No)
            *   64 - ? (No)
            *   38 + 40 = 78 (No)
            *   40 - 38 = 2 (No)
            *   38 * 40 (Too large)
            *   40 / 38 (No)
        *   93 / X = 27 (X = 93/27, not integer)
        *   X - 93 = 27 => X = 120. Can I get 120 from {64, 38, 40}?
            *   64 + 38 + 40 = 142 (No)
            *   64 + 38 = 102 (No)
            *   64 + 40 = 104 (No)
            *   38 + 40 = 78 (No)
            *   64 * ? (No)
            *   (64 + 38) + 40 = 142

3129,1618,"<think>The user wants an equation that uses the numbers 25, 91, 50, and 56 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to equal 60.

Let's list the numbers: [25, 91, 50, 56]
Target: 60

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(91 + 56) = 147. How to get 60 from 147, 25, 50? (147 - 50 - 25) = 72. Not 60.
(91 - 56) = 35. How to get 60 from 35, 25, 50? (35 + 25) = 60. Then I have 50 left. (60 * 50) or (60 / 50) or (60 + 50) or (60 - 50). None of these work.
(91 * 56) is too large.
(91 / 56) is not an integer.

Possibility 2: Try combining smaller numbers first.
(25 + 50) = 75. Remaining: [91, 56]. Target from 75: 60. Need to subtract 15. Can I get 15 from 91 and 56? (91 - 56) = 35. No. (56 - 91) is negative. (91/56) not integer. (91*56) too large.
(50 - 25) = 25. Remaining: [91, 56]. Target from 25: 60. Need to add 35. Can I get 35 from 91 and 56? (91 - 56) = 35. Yes!
So, (50 - 25) = 25. And (91 - 56) = 35.
If I add these two results: 25 + 35 = 60.
This uses all numbers: 50, 25, 91, 56.
The operations are subtraction and addition.
The equation would be (50 - 25) + (91 - 56) = 60.

Let's verify:
(50 - 25) = 25
(91 - 56) = 35
25 + 35 = 60.
This works.

Let's try another approach to be sure.

Possibility 3: Multiplication involved.
Maybe one number is multiplied by a result from others.
Let's try dividing 50 by 25: (50 / 25) = 2. Remaining: [91, 56]. Target from 2: 60. Need to get 58 from 91 and 56. (91 - 56) = 35. No. (91 + 56) = 147. No.
Let's try dividing 56 by something. Not obvious.

Let's go back to the successful one: (50 - 25) + (91 - 56) = 60.
This is a valid solution.

Are there other possibilities?
What if we multiply first?
(25 * 2) = 50. But I don't have a 2.
(25 * ?)
(50 * ?)
(56 * ?)
(91 * ?)

Let's consider the numbers again: [25, 91, 50, 56]. Target: 60.
We found (50 - 25) + (91 - 56) = 60.

Let's try to rearrange the terms.
(91 - 56) + (50 - 25) = 60. Same equation.

What about division?
Can we get a number close to 60 by division?
(91 / ?)
(56 / ?)
(50 / ?)
(25 / ?)

Let's try to get a number that, when combined with another, gives 60.
For example, if we can make 10, then 50 + 10 = 60.
Can we make 10 from [25, 91, 56]?
(56 - ?)
(91 - ?)

(91 - 25) = 66.
(56 - 25) = 31.

What if we try to make 12? Then 5 * 12 = 60. I don't have a 5.
What if we try to make 3? Then 20 * 3 = 60. I don't have a 20.
What if we try to make 4? Then 15 * 4 = 60. I don't have a 15.

Let's try to make a number that, when subtracted from another, gives 60.
e.g., X - Y = 60.
If X = 91, Y = 31. Can I make 31 from [25, 50, 56]? (56 - 25) = 31. Yes.
So, 91 - (56 - 25) = 91 - 31 = 60.
This uses 91, 56, 25. I have 50 left. This doesn't work.

If X = 56, Y = -4. Not useful.
If X = 50, Y = -10. Not useful.
If X = 25, Y = -35. Not useful.

What if we try to make a number that, when divided by another, gives 60?
X / Y = 60.
If Y = 1, X = 60.
If Y = 2, X = 120.
If Y = 3, X = 180.

Let's try to make a number that, when added to another, gives 60.
X + Y = 60.
We already found (50 - 25) + (91 - 56) = 25 + 35 = 60.

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by another, gives 60.
X * Y = 60.
Possible integer pairs for (X, Y) are (1, 60), (2, 30), (3, 20), (4, 15), (5, 12), (6, 10).
Can we make any of these pairs from the numbers [25, 91, 50, 56]?

Can we make 6 and 10?
From [25, 91, 50, 56].
(50 / 5) = 10. I don't have a 5.
(56 / ?)
(91 / ?)

Let's try to make 10 from two numbers and 6 from the other two.
Make 10: (50 / 5) - need 5.
Make 6: (56 / ?)

Let's try to make 12 and 5.
Make 12: (56 / ?)
Make 5: (25 / 5) - need 5.

Let's try to make 15 and 4.
Make 15: (50 - ?)
Make 4: (56 / 14) - need 14.

Let's try to make 20 and 3.
Make 20: (50 - ?)
Make 3: (91 / ?)

Let's try to make 30 and 2.
Make 30: (56 - 25) = 31. Close. (50 - ?)
Make 2: (50 / 25) = 2. Yes.
So we have 2 from (50 / 25). Remaining numbers are [91, 56].
Can we make 30 from 91 and 56?
(91 - 56) = 35. No.

I will choose the first one I found: (44 - 32) + 80.

Review:
- Numbers used: 44, 32, 80. All used once.
- Operations used: -, +. Allowed operations.
- Result: (44 - 32) + 80 = 12 + 80 = 92. Correct target value.

5257,61,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 96, 66, and 94, each exactly once, to equal 33. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try combinations:
1.  (96 + 66) - 94 = 162 - 94 = 68 (Too high)
2.  (96 - 66) + 94 = 30 + 94 = 124 (Too high)
3.  (96 * 66) - 94 = 6336 - 94 (Way too high)
4.  96 / 66 ... not a whole number, unlikely to lead to 33 easily.
5.  (96 + 94) - 66 = 190 - 66 = 124 (Too high)
6.  (96 - 94) + 66 = 2 + 66 = 68 (Too high)
7.  (66 + 94) - 96 = 160 - 96 = 64 (Too high)
8.  (66 - 94) + 96 = -28 + 96 = 68 (Too high)
9.  96 - (66 + 94) = 96 - 160 = -64 (Too low)
10. 96 - (94 - 66) = 96 - 28 = 68 (Too high)
11. 66 - (96 - 94) = 66 - 2 = 64 (Too high)
12. 94 - (96 - 66) = 94 - 30 = 64 (Too high)
13. 94 - (66 - 96) = 94 - (-30) = 124 (Too high)

Let's try division with one of the numbers.
Maybe 96 / something? Or 66 / something? Or 94 / something?
If we divide 96 by something, it needs to be a factor. Factors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96. None of the other numbers (66, 94) are factors.

What if we use division to get a smaller number first?
(96 / ?)
(66 / ?)
(94 / ?)

Let's consider the target number 33.
Could it be something like (A * B) / C = 33?
Or A - (B / C) = 33?
Or (A / B) + C = 33?

Let's try to get a number close to 33 by combining two numbers, then adjust with the third.
96 - 66 = 30. We need +3. Can we get 3 from 94? No.
96 - 94 = 2. We need +31. Can we get 31 from 66? No.
66 - 94 = -28. We need +61. Can we get 61 from 96? No.
96 + 66 = 162. We need -129. Can we get 129 from 94? No.
96 + 94 = 190. We need -157. Can we get 157 from 66? No.
66 + 94 = 160. We need -127. Can we get 127 from 96? No.

Let's try division again.
What if we divide 96 by something related to 66 and 94?
What if we divide 66 by something related to 96 and 94?
What if we divide 94 by something related to 96 and 66?

Consider the structure: A - B / C = 33.
If A = 96, then 96 - B/C = 33, so B/C = 96 - 33 = 63.
Can we get 63 from 66 and 94 using division? 66/94 or 94/66? No.

If A = 66, then 66 - B/C = 33, so B/C = 66 - 33 = 33.
Can we get 33 from 96 and 94 using division? 96/94 or 94/96? No.

If A = 94, then 94 - B/C = 33, so B/C = 94 - 33 = 61.
Can we get 61 from 96 and 66 using division? 96/66 or 66/96? No.

Consider the structure: A + B / C = 33.
If A = 96, then 96 + B/C = 33, so B/C = 33 - 96 = -63. Not possible with positive numbers.
If A = 66, then 66 + B/C = 33, so B/C = 33 - 66 = -33. Not possible.
If A = 94, then 94 + B/C = 33, so B/C = 33 - 94 = -61. Not possible.

Consider the structure: A * B / C = 33.
If C = 96, then A*B = 33 * 96 = 3168. Can we get 3168 from 66 and 94? 66*94 = 6204. No.
If C = 66, then A*B = 33 * 66 = 2178. Can we get 2178 from 96 and 94? 96*94 = 9024. No.
If C = 94, then A*B = 33 * 94 = 3102. Can we get 3102 from 96 and 66? 96*66 = 6336. No.

Let's try a different approach.
We need to get 33.
Maybe one of the numbers is used in a division that results in a small integer.
96 / 3 = 32. Can we get 3 from 66 and 94? No.
66 / 2 = 33. Can we get 2 from 96 and 94? Yes, 96 - 94 = 2.
So, 66 / (96 - 94) = 66 / 2 = 33.
This uses 66, 96, and 94 exactly once.
The operations are division and subtraction.
The result is 33.

Let's double check:
Numbers used: 96, 66, 94 (each once).
Operations used: /, -
Result: 66 / (96 - 94) = 66 / 2 = 33.
All conditions are met.

The user wants me to find an equation using the numbers 70, 44, and 60, and the operations +, -, *, /. Each number must be used exactly once, and the target result is 34.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations. Let's list the numbers: N1 = 70, N2 = 44, N3 = 60. Target = 34.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3
2. N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Let's try structure 1: (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3

Trial 1: (70 + 44) - 60
   70 + 44 = 114
   114 - 60 = 54. Not 34.

Trial 2: (70 - 44) + 60
   70 - 44 = 26
   26 + 60 = 86. Not 34.

Trial 3: (70 * 44) - 60
   70 * 44 = 3080
   3080 - 60 = 3020. Not 34.

Trial 4: (70 / 44) - 60
   70 / 44 is not an integer. This might lead to non-integer intermediate results, which is allowed, but let's prioritize integer results first if possible. 70/44 = 1.59...
   1.59... - 60 = -58.41... Not 34.

Trial 5: (70 + 60) - 44
   70 + 60 = 130
   130 - 44 = 86. Not 34.

Trial 6: (70 - 60) + 44
   70 - 60 = 10
   10 + 44 = 54. Not 34.

Trial 7: (70 * 60) - 44
   70 * 60 = 4200
   4200 - 44 = 4156. Not 34.

Trial 8: (70 / 60) - 44
   70 / 60 = 7/6 = 1.166...
   1.166... - 44 = -42.833... Not 34.

Let's try structure 2: N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Trial 9: 70 + (44 - 60)
   44 - 60 = -16
   70 + (-16) = 54. Not 34.

Trial 10: 70 - (44 + 60)
   44 + 60 = 104
   70 - 104 = -34. Close, but negative.

Trial 11: 70 - (60 - 44)
   60 - 44 = 16
   70 - 16 = 54. Not 34.

Trial 12: 70 * (44 - 60)
   44 - 60 = -16
   70 * (-16) = -1120. Not 34.

Trial 13: 70 / (44 - 60)
   44 - 60 = -16
   70 / (-16) = -4.375. Not 34.

Trial 14: 70 + (60 - 44)
   60 - 44 = 16
   70 + 16 = 86. Not 34.

Trial 15: 70 - (60 + 44)
   60 + 44 = 104
   70 - 104 = -34. Still negative.

Let's consider the order of operations more broadly. The numbers are 70, 44, 60. Target is 34.

What if we use division to reduce the numbers?
Maybe 70 / something? Or something / 70?
Maybe 44 / something? Or something / 44?
Maybe 60 / something? Or something / 60?

Let's try combinations that might result in a number around 34.
We have 70, 44, 60.
If we subtract 60 from 70, we get 10. Then we have 10 and 44. 10 + 44 = 54. 44 - 10 = 34.
So, (70 - 60) = 10. Then 44 - 10 = 34.
This means 44 - (70 - 60) = 34.
Let's check:
Numbers used: 44, 70, 60. All used once.
Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
Result: 44 - (10) = 34. Correct.

Let's verify the structure: N2 - (N1 - N3)
44 - (70 - 60) = 44 - 10 = 34. This works.

Are there other possibilities?
Let's try starting with 60.
(60 - 44) = 16. Then we have 16 and 70. 70 - 16 = 54. 16 + 70 = 86.
(60 + 44) = 104. Then we have 104 and 70. 104 - 70 = 34.
So, (60 + 44) - 70 = 34.
Let's check:
Numbers used: 60, 44, 70. All used once.
Operations used: +, -. Allowed.
Result: (104) - 70 = 34. Correct.

This is another valid solution. The prompt asks for *an* equation. I have found two:
1. 44 - (70 - 60) = 34
2. (60 + 44) - 70 = 34

Let's try to see if multiplication or division can be used.
Numbers: 70, 44, 60. Target: 34.

Consider 70. How can we get close to 34?
70 / 2 = 35. Can we make 2 from 44 and 60? No, not easily with one operation.
70 - 36 = 34. Can we make 36 from 44 and 60? 60 - 44 = 16. 44 - 60 = -16. 60 + 44 = 104. 60 * 44 = 2640. 60 / 44. 44 / 60. No.

Consider 44.
44 - 10 = 34. Can we make 10 from 70 and 60? Yes, 70 - 60 = 10.
So, 44 - (70 - 60) = 34. This is the first solution I found.

Consider 60.
60 - 26 = 34. Can we make 26 from 70 and 44? Yes, 70 - 44 = 26.
So, 60 - (70 - 44) = 34.
Let's check:
Numbers used: 60, 70, 44. All used once.
Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
Result: 60 - (26) = 34. Correct.

This is a third valid solution: 60 - (70 - 44) = 34.

Let's try to use division.
Numbers: 70, 44, 60. Target: 34.

What if we divide 70 by something?
70 / x. If x is around 2, we get 35.
Can we make 2 from 44 and 60? No.

What if we divide 60 by something?
60 / x.
60 / (something) + something_else = 34.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 68, 48, and 79, with the result being 37.
I can only use the four basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 68, 48, 79.
Target result: 37.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations.
Possible combinations of operations:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try different arrangements and operations.

Attempt 1: Start with the largest number, 79.
Maybe subtract something from 79 to get closer to 37.
79 - x = 37 => x = 79 - 37 = 42.
Can I get 42 from 68 and 48?
68 - 48 = 20 (No)
68 + 48 = 116 (No)
68 * 48 (Too large)
68 / 48 (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 42 easily)
48 - 68 (Negative)
48 / 68 (Fraction)

Let's try subtracting 48 from 79.
79 - 48 = 31.
Now I need to use 68 to get from 31 to 37.
31 + 68 = 99 (No)
31 - 68 (Negative)
31 * 68 (Too large)
31 / 68 (Fraction)

Let's try subtracting 68 from 79.
79 - 68 = 11.
Now I need to use 48 to get from 11 to 37.
11 + 48 = 59 (No)
11 - 48 (Negative)
11 * 48 (Too large)
11 / 48 (Fraction)

Attempt 2: Start with 68.
68 - x = 37 => x = 68 - 37 = 31.
Can I get 31 from 48 and 79?
79 - 48 = 31.
This looks promising!
So, the equation could be 68 - (79 - 48).
Let's check:
79 - 48 = 31
68 - 31 = 37.
This works! The numbers 68, 79, and 48 are used exactly once. The operations are subtraction.

Let's verify the order of operations and parentheses.
68 - (79 - 48) = 68 - 31 = 37.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough.

Attempt 3: Start with 48.
48 - x = 37 => x = 48 - 37 = 11.
Can I get 11 from 68 and 79?
79 - 68 = 11.
So, the equation could be 48 - (79 - 68).
Let's check:
79 - 68 = 11
48 - 11 = 37.
This also works! The numbers 48, 79, and 68 are used exactly once. The operations are subtraction.

Both 68 - (79 - 48) and 48 - (79 - 68) are valid solutions. I will present one of them. The first one I found was 68 - (79 - 48).

Let's try a different structure, like (a op1 b) op2 c.
(68 - 48) + 79 = 20 + 79 = 99 (No)
(68 + 48) - 79 = 116 - 79 = 37.
This also works!
Numbers used: 68, 48, 79. Operations: +, -. Result: 37.
Equation: (68 + 48) - 79.
Let's check:
68 + 48 = 116
116 - 79 = 37.
This is another valid solution.

Let's try (68 - 79) + 48. This would involve negative numbers early on.
68 - 79 = -11
-11 + 48 = 37.
This also works!
Numbers used: 68, 79, 48. Operations: -, +. Result: 37.
Equation: (68 - 79) + 48.

Let's try (48 - 68) + 79.
48 - 68 = -20
-20 + 79 = 59 (No)

Let's try (48 + 79) - 68.
48 + 79 = 127
127 - 68 = 59 (No)

Let's try (79 - 68) + 48.
79 - 68 = 11
11 + 48 = 59 (No)

Let's try (79 + 48) - 68.
79 + 48 = 127
127 - 68 = 59 (No)

Let's try multiplication or division.
Could division be involved?
If 79 / something is involved, it's unlikely to result in an integer that helps get to 37 easily.
If 68 / 48 or 48 / 68 or 79 / 68 or 79 / 48 or 48 / 79 or 68 / 79 are used, we get fractions.
Let's see if a fraction can be cancelled out.
Example: (68 * 48) / 79? Too large.
Example: (68 / x) * y?

Let's revisit the successful ones:
1. 68 - (79 - 48) = 37
2. 48 - (79 - 68) = 37
3. (68 + 48) - 79 = 37
4. (68 - 79) + 48 = 37

All these are valid. I will pick one that seems straightforward. (68 + 48) - 79 is quite direct.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Numbers: [68 48 79] - used.
- Result: 37 - achieved.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - only + and - used.
- Each number used once - yes.

I will present (68 + 48) - 79.
Intermediate calculation:
68 + 48 = 116
116 - 79 = 37.
This is clear and uses the numbers and operations correctly.

The target number is 33.
The given set of integers is [33, 32, 86, 12].
I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: 33, 32, 86, 12.
Target: 33.

Initial thoughts:
Since 33 is in the set, maybe I can isolate it or use it directly.
If I use 33 directly, I need to combine the remaining numbers (32, 86, 12) to equal 0.
Can I make 0 from 32, 86, 12?
Possible combinations:
32 + 86 - 12 = 118 - 12 = 106 (not 0)
32 - 86 + 12 = -54 + 12 = -42 (not 0)
32 * 86 - 12 = large number
32 / 86 - 12 = fraction
(32 - 86) * 12 = -54 * 12 = -648 (not 0)
(86 - 32) - 12 = 54 - 12 = 42 (not 0)
(86 - 12) - 32 = 74 - 32 = 42 (not 0)
(32 + 12) - 86 = 44 - 86 = -42 (not 0)
(86 + 12) - 32 = 98 - 32 = 66 (not 0)
(32 * 12) - 86 = 384 - 86 = 298 (not 0)
86 - (32 + 12) = 86 - 44 = 42 (not 0)
86 - (32 * 12) = 86 - 384 = -298 (not 0)
86 / (32 - 12) = 86 / 20 = 4.3 (not 0)
(86 - 32) / 12 = 54 / 12 = 4.5 (not 0)
(32 - 12) / 86 = 20 / 86 (fraction)
(86 + 32) / 12 = 118 / 12 (fraction)
(86 + 12) / 32 = 98 / 32 (fraction)
(32 + 86) / 12 = 118 / 12 (fraction)
(32 * 86) / 12 = 2752 / 12 (fraction)
86 / 12 * 32 = fraction
32 / 12 * 86 = fraction

It seems difficult to make 0 from 32, 86, 12. So, using 33 directly might not be the easiest path.

Let's try to build up to 33 using other numbers.
Numbers: 33, 32, 86, 12. Target: 33.

Consider combinations involving multiplication or division first, as they can change magnitudes significantly.

What if I try to get a number close to 33 and then adjust?

86 + 12 = 98
86 - 12 = 74
86 * 12 = 1032
86 / 12 = 7.16...

Let's look for combinations that might lead to 33.
Maybe a large number divided by something?
(86 * 12) / ? = 1032 / ?
1032 / 33 = 31.15...
1032 / 32 = 32.25
1032 / (33-32) = 1032 / 1 = 1032 (uses 33, 32, 86, 12) -> 86 * 12 / (33-32) = 1032. Not 33.

What about subtraction from a larger number?
Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 33 and subtract.
Or a number slightly smaller than 33 and add.

Consider the numbers again: 33, 32, 86, 12. Target: 33.

Let's try to use division to reduce numbers.
86 / 12 is not clean.
32 / 12 is not clean.

What if we combine 32 and 12?
32 + 12 = 44
32 - 12 = 20
32 * 12 = 384

Let's try using 86 and 33.
86 - 33 = 53. Remaining: 32, 12. Can we make 53 from 32, 12? No.
86 + 33 = 119. Remaining: 32, 12. Can we make 119 from 32, 12? No.

Let's try to use 32 and 12.

Let's consider division again.

Or (something) - (something else) = 33.
Or (something) + (something else) = 33.

4364,1002,"<think>The problem asks me to use the numbers 31, 92, 8, and 4 exactly once, with standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target value of 59.

Let's list the numbers: [31, 92, 8, 4]
Target: 59

I need to try different combinations and operations.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to 59 using a subset of the numbers and then incorporate the remaining ones.
3. Consider the order of operations (parentheses).

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
Maybe start with 92.
92 - ? = 59.  92 - 33 = 59. Can I make 33 from 31, 8, 4?
31 + 8 - 4 = 35 (close)
31 + 4 - 8 = 27
31 - 8 + 4 = 27
31 - 4 + 8 = 35
8 * 4 + 31 = 32 + 31 = 63 (too big)
8 * 4 - 31 = 32 - 31 = 1
31 / ? - this is unlikely to yield integers easily.

Attempt 2:
Let's try combining 31 and 92 first.
92 - 31 = 61.  Need to get 59 from 61 using 8 and 4.
61 - (8/4) = 61 - 2 = 59. This looks promising!
Let's check if all numbers are used: 92, 31, 8, 4. Yes.
Let's check if operations are standard: -, /, -. Yes.
Let's check the calculation: 92 - 31 - (8 / 4) = 61 - 2 = 59.

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's try another path to be sure or to explore alternatives.

Attempt 3:
Maybe multiplication is involved to get closer to 59.
8 * 4 = 32.
Can I combine 31 and 92 with 32 to get 59?
31 + 32 = 63.  Need to get 59 from 63 using 92.  63 - 92 is negative.
92 - 32 = 60.  Need to get 59 from 60 using 31.  60 - 31 is not 59.
31 * 4 = 124 (too big)
31 * 8 = 248 (too big)
92 / 4 = 23.
Can I combine 31, 8, and 23 to get 59?
23 + 31 = 54. Need 59 from 54 using 8. 54 + 8 = 62. 54 - 8 = 46.
23 + 8 = 31. Need 59 from 31 using 31. 31 + 31 = 62. 31 - 31 = 0.
23 * 8 = 184 (too big)

Let's go back to the first successful attempt.
Numbers: [31, 92, 8, 4]
Target: 59

Equation: 92 - 31 - (8 / 4)

Let's verify the order of operations:
1. Parentheses first: 8 / 4 = 2
2. Subtraction from left to right: 92 - 31 = 61
3. Final subtraction: 61 - 2 = 59

This is correct.

Let's consider if there are other ways to write it.
(92 - 31) - (8 / 4) = 61 - 2 = 59. This is the same.
92 - (31 + (8/4)) = 92 - (31 + 2) = 92 - 33 = 59. This is also valid.
Let's check the numbers used: 92, 31, 8, 4. All used once.
Operations: -, +, /. Standard.

So, both `92 - 31 - (8 / 4)` and `92 - (31 + (8 / 4))` are valid.
The problem asks for ""an equation"". I will present one of them.
The first one `92 - 31 - (8 / 4)` is slightly more direct in terms of calculation flow.

Let's double check the problem statement: ""present only that final equation, precisely as it should be"".

I will use `92 - 31 - (8 / 4)`.

The user wants me to find a mathematical equation that results in 78 using the numbers [98, 78, 48, 49].
I must use each number exactly once.
I can only use the operations +, -, *, /.

The target is 78.
The numbers are 98, 78, 48, 49.

Let's look at the numbers and the target.
The number 78 is already present in the list. This is a strong hint.
If I can isolate 78, I might be able to add or subtract zero using the other numbers.

Strategy 1: Try to make zero from 98, 48, 49.
Can I make 0 from 98, 48, 49 using +, -, *, /?
(98 - 48) = 50. Then I have 50 and 49. 50 - 49 = 1. Not 0.
(98 - 49) = 49. Then I have 49 and 48. 49 - 48 = 1. Not 0.
(48 - 49) = -1. Then I have 98 and -1. 98 + (-1) = 97. Not 0.
(48 + 49) = 97. Then I have 98 and 97. 98 - 97 = 1. Not 0.
(98 / 49) = 2. Then I have 2 and 48. 48 - 2 = 46. Not 0.
(98 * 48) is a large number.
(48 / 98) is a fraction.
(49 / 98) = 0.5.
(48 / 49) is a fraction.

It seems difficult to make exactly 0 from 98, 48, 49.

Strategy 2: Use 78 directly and manipulate the other numbers to add/subtract/multiply/divide to get the desired result.

If I use 78 as the base, I need to combine 98, 48, 49 to get 0. We already explored this and it was hard.

Let's try other combinations.
Maybe 78 is not the final number added or subtracted.

Consider the numbers: 98, 78, 48, 49. Target: 78.

What if I multiply two numbers?
98 * 78 (too big)
98 * 48 (too big)
98 * 49 (too big)
78 * 48 (too big)
78 * 49 (too big)
48 * 49 = 2352 (too big)

What if I divide?
98 / 48 (fraction)
98 / 49 = 2
98 / 78 (fraction)
78 / 48 (fraction)
78 / 49 (fraction)
48 / 49 (fraction)
49 / 48 (fraction)
49 / 98 = 0.5

Let's try using the division 98 / 49 = 2.
Now I have numbers [2, 78, 48] and the target is 78.
Can I combine 2, 78, 48 to get 78?
If I use 78 directly:
78 + (2 - 48) = 78 + (-46) = 32 (No)
78 + (48 - 2) = 78 + 46 = 124 (No)
78 - (48 - 2) = 78 - 46 = 32 (No)
78 - (2 - 48) = 78 - (-46) = 124 (No)
78 * (something) - this will likely be too big or too small unless the something is 1.
Can I make 1 from 2 and 48? No.

What if 78 is not the number I add/subtract at the end?
Let's go back to 98 / 49 = 2. Numbers are [2, 78, 48]. Target 78.
Maybe the 78 is part of a multiplication or subtraction.

Try combining 48 and 2 first.
48 + 2 = 50. Numbers [50, 78]. Target 78. 78 - 50 = 28. No.
48 - 2 = 46. Numbers [46, 78]. Target 78. 78 - 46 = 32. No.
48 * 2 = 96. Numbers [96, 78]. Target 78. 96 - 78 = 18. No. 78 - 96 = -18. No.
48 / 2 = 24. Numbers [24, 78]. Target 78. 78 - 24 = 54. No.

Let's try combining 78 and 2 first.
78 + 2 = 80. Numbers [80, 48]. Target 78. 80 - 48 = 32. No.
78 - 2 = 76. Numbers [76, 48]. Target 78. 76 + 48 = 124. No. 48 - 76 = -28. No.
78 * 2 = 156. Numbers [156, 48]. Target 78. 156 - 48 = 108. No.
78 / 2 = 39. Numbers [39, 48]. Target 78. 39 + 48 = 87. No. 48 - 39 = 9. No.

Let's try combining 78 and 48 first.
78 + 48 = 126. Numbers [126, 2]. Target 78. 126 - 2 = 124. No.
78 - 48 = 30. Numbers [30, 2]. Target 78. 30 * 2 = 60. No. 30 + 2 = 32. No.
48 - 78 = -30. Numbers [-30, 2]. Target 78. -30 * 2 = -60. No.
78 * 48 (too big)
78 / 48 (fraction)
48 / 78 (fraction)

So, the path (98 / 49) = 2 doesn't seem to lead directly to 78.

Let's reconsider the numbers: 98, 78, 48, 49. Target: 78.

What if 48 is involved in a subtraction from 98?
98 - 48 = 50. Numbers [50, 78, 49]. Target 78.
Can I make 28 from 78 and 49 to add to 50? 78 - 49 = 29. Close. 50 + 29 = 79. No.
Can I make 78 from 50, 78, 49?
50 + 78 - 49 = 128 - 49 = 79. No.
50 + 49 - 78 = 99 - 78 = 21. No.
78 - (50 - 49) = 78 - 1 = 77. No.
78 - (49 - 50) = 78 - (-1) = 79. No.

What if 49 is involved in a subtraction from 98?
98 - 49 = 49. Numbers [49, 78, 48]. Target 78.
Can I make 30 from 78 and 48 to add to 49? 78 - 48 = 30. Yes!
So, 49 + (78 - 48) = 49 + 30 = 79. Close, but not 78.
Let's check the order of operations.
(98 - 49) + (78 - 48) = 49 + 30 = 79.

Let's try another combination with 98 - 49",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants me to find an arithmetic equation using the numbers 14, 34, and 68 exactly once, along with the basic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target value of 28.

Let's list the numbers: [14, 34, 68]
Target: 28

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the four basic ones. This gives a large number of possibilities, but I can try to be strategic.

Let's consider the target value (28) and the given numbers.
The numbers are 14, 34, 68.
The target is 28.

Notice that 14 is half of 28. This might be a useful starting point.
Also, 68 is roughly twice 34.

Let's try to see if we can get 28 by combining two numbers first, and then incorporating the third.

Possibility 1: Start with 14.
If I have 14, how can I get 28 using 34 and 68?
Maybe 14 * 2 = 28. Can I make 2 from 34 and 68?
68 / 34 = 2.
So, (68 / 34) * 14 = 2 * 14 = 28.
This uses 14, 34, and 68 exactly once.
The operations used are division (/) and multiplication (*).
This looks like a valid solution. Let's double-check the order of operations.
(68 / 34) * 14 = 2 * 14 = 28. This is correct.

Let's explore other combinations to be thorough.

Permutations of (14, 34, 68):
1. 14, 34, 68
2. 14, 68, 34
3. 34, 14, 68
4. 34, 68, 14

   - 14 / (34 * 68) (Fraction)
   - 14 / (34 / 68) = 14 / 0.5 = 28. This uses 14, 34, 68. Operations are / and /.
     Let's check: 14 / (34 / 68) = 14 / (1/2) = 14 * 2 = 28.
     This is another valid solution: 14 / (34 / 68).

Let's check the first solution again: (68 / 34) * 14 = 2 * 14 = 28.
This is also valid.

Let's try another permutation.

1916,226,"<think>The problem requires me to form a single arithmetic equation that evaluates to 34, using the numbers 45, 60, 90, and 4 exactly once. I can only use the operators +, -, *, and /.

Let's list the numbers: {45, 60, 90, 4}.
The target value is 34.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operators. Since there are four numbers, there will be three operations. The order of operations matters, so I need to consider parentheses as well, although the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention them. However, to achieve specific intermediate results, parentheses are often necessary. Let's assume standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and explore possibilities.

Let's try to get close to 34 with some initial combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(90 + 60) = 150. Then use 45 and 4. 150 - 45 = 105. 105 / 4 is not an integer.
(90 - 60) = 30. Then use 45 and 4. 30 + 45 = 75. 75 / 4 is not an integer. 30 * 45 = 1350. 1350 / 4 is not an integer. 30 + 4 = 34. This looks promising! If I can use 45 and 60 to get 30, and then add 4, I'd be close.
Let's see if I can get 30 from 45 and 60.
60 - 45 = 15. Not 30.
45 - 60 = -15. Not 30.
60 / 45 is not an integer.
45 / 60 is not an integer.
60 * 45 is too large.

Let's reconsider the 30 + 4 = 34 idea.
If I can make 30 using 45, 60, and 90, and then add 4.
Or if I can make 30 using 45, 60, and 4, and then add 90 (this won't work as 90 is too large).
Or if I can make 30 using 45, 90, and 4, and then add 60 (this won't work).
Or if I can make 30 using 60, 90, and 4, and then add 45 (this won't work).

Let's focus on getting 30 from {45, 60, 90}.
(90 / ?) = 30. 90 / 3 = 30. Can I make 3 from {45, 60}? No.
(? / ?) = 30.
(? * ?) = 30.
(? + ?) = 30.
(? - ?) = 30.

Let's try to get 30 from {45, 60}. No obvious way.
Let's try to get 30 from {45, 90}. 90 / ? = 30 -> 90 / 3. Can't make 3 from 45. 45 / ? = 30. No.
Let's try to get 30 from {60, 90}. 90 - 60 = 30. Yes!
So, if I use (90 - 60) = 30, I have used 90 and 60. The remaining numbers are 45 and 4.
The equation so far is (90 - 60) ... 45 ... 4 = 34.
If I do (90 - 60) + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34. I have used 90, 60, and 4. I still need to use 45.
How can I incorporate 45 without changing the result of 34?
I can multiply by 1, or add 0, or subtract 0.
Can I make 1 from 45? No.
Can I make 0 from 45? No.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe the 4 is used in division.
If 4 is the divisor, the numerator must be 34 * 4 = 136.
Can I make 136 from {45, 60, 90}?
90 + 60 = 150. 150 - 45 = 105. Not 136.
90 + 45 = 135. Close! 135 + 60 = 195. 135 - 60 = 75.
60 + 45 = 105. 105 + 90 = 195. 105 - 90 = 15.
90 * ?
60 * ?
45 * ?

Let's try to get 136 from {45, 60, 90}.
(90 + 45) = 135. I need 1 more. I have 60 left. Can't get 1 from 60.
(90 + 60) = 150. I need to subtract 14. I have 45 left. Can't get 14 from 45.
(60 + 45) = 105. I need to add 31. I have 90 left. Can't get 31 from 90.

What if 4 is not the final divisor?
Let's try combinations that result in numbers around 34.

Consider the numbers: 45, 60, 90, 4. Target: 34.

Try using multiplication first.
45 * 4 = 180. Remaining: {60, 90}. 180 - 90 = 90. 90 + 60 = 150. 90 - 60 = 30. 180 / 60 = 3. 3 + 90 = 93. 3 - 90 = -87.
60 * 4 = 240. Remaining: {45, 90}. 240 - 90 = 150. 150 - 45 = 105. 240 / 90 not integer. 240 / 45 not integer.
90 * 4 = 360. Remaining: {45, 60}. 360 - 60 = 300. 300 - 45 = 255. 360 / 60 = 6. 6 + 45 = 51. 6 - 45 = -39. 360 / 45 = 8. 8 + 60 = 68. 8 - 60 = -52.

Let's try division first.
90 / 45 = 2. Remaining: {60, 4}. 2 + 60 = 62. 62 - 4 = 58. 2 * 60 = 120. 120 - 4 = 116. 2 + 4 = 6. 6 * 60 = 360.
90 / 60 is not integer.
60 / 45 is not integer.
60 / 4 = 15. Remaining: {45, 90}. 15 + 45 = 60. 60 - 90 = -30. 15 * 45 = 675. 675 - 90 = 585. 15 + 90 = 105. 105 - 45 = 60.
45 / ?
4 / ?

Let's go back to the idea of getting close to 34.
We saw (90 - 60) + 4 = 34. We need to incorporate 45.
What if 45 is used to modify one of the numbers before the operation?
Example: (90 - (60 - 45)) + 4 = (90 - 15) + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79.
Example: (90 - (60 + 45)) + 4 = (90 - 105) + 4 = -15",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
5553,12,"<think>The target is 16. The numbers are [21, 39, 34, 36].
I need to combine these four numbers using +, -, *, / to get 16.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are relatively large. Division might be useful to reduce them.
36 / ?
34 / ?
39 / ?
21 / ?

What if I try to get a number close to 16 and then adjust?
36 - 21 = 15. Close. I have 39 and 34 left. Can I get 1 from 39 and 34?
39 - 34 = 5. No.
39 + 34 = 73. No.
39 * 34 = large. No.
39 / 34 = not integer.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe combine two numbers first.
36 - 34 = 2. Left with 21, 39. Can I get 14 from 21 and 39?
21 + 39 = 60. No.
39 - 21 = 18. No.
21 * 39 = large. No.
39 / 21 = not integer.

39 - 36 = 3. Left with 21, 34. Can I get 13 from 21 and 34?
34 - 21 = 13. Yes!
So, (39 - 36) + (34 - 21) = 3 + 13 = 16.
This uses all numbers [21, 39, 34, 36] exactly once.
The operations are +, -, -.

Let's check the order of operations.
(39 - 36) + (34 - 21)
3 + 13 = 16.
This looks correct.

Let's try another one just to be sure.
Maybe division is involved.
36 / (something)
36 / 2 = 18. Need to get -2 from 21, 39, 34.
(39 - 34) - 21 = 5 - 21 = -16. No.
21 - (39 - 34) = 21 - 5 = 16. No.

What if I try to make a number that divides into another?
34 is not easily divisible by 21, 39, 36.
36 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.
Can I make 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 from the other numbers?
Let's try to make 2.
39 - 34 - 21 = 5 - 21 = -16. No.
21 - (39 - 34) = 21 - 5 = 16. No.

Let's go back to the first successful one.
(39 - 36) + (34 - 21) = 16.
This is a valid equation.

Are there other possibilities?
Maybe multiplication first?
21 * ?
39 * ?
34 * ?
36 * ?

Let's try to get a number close to 16 by multiplication and then adjust.
21 * 1 = 21. Need -5 from 39, 34, 36.
34 - 39 = -5. Left with 36.
So, 21 * 1 + (34 - 39) = 21 - 5 = 16.
But I need to use 36. How to get 1 from 36? 36/36 = 1.
So, 21 * (36/36) + (34 - 39) = 21 * 1 + (-5) = 21 - 5 = 16.
This uses 21, 36, 36, 34, 39. I used 36 twice. Not allowed.

Let's reconsider the numbers: [21, 39, 34, 36]. Target: 16.

Try to make a number that can be subtracted from a larger number to get 16.
39 - ? = 16 => ? = 23. Can I get 23 from 21, 34, 36?
34 - 21 = 13. No.
36 - ?
34 - ?
21 - ?

Let's try to make a number that can be added to a smaller number to get 16.
21 + ? = 16 => ? = -5. Can I get -5 from 39, 34, 36?
34 - 39 = -5. Left with 36.
So, 21 + (34 - 39) = 16. I need to use 36.
How to incorporate 36?
Maybe 21 + (34 - 39) * (36/36)? No, uses 36 twice.
Maybe 21 + (34 - 39) + (36 - 36)? No, uses 36 twice.

Let's go back to the first solution: (39 - 36) + (34 - 21) = 16.
This is clean and uses all numbers once.

Let's try to see if division can be used in a different way.
(36 + 21) / ? = 57 / ?
(39 + 21) / ? = 60 / ?
(34 + 21) / ? = 55 / ?
(39 + 34) / ? = 73 / ?
(39 + 36) / ? = 75 / ?
(34 + 36) / ? = 70 / ?

(36 - 21) / ? = 15 / ?
(39 - 21) / ? = 18 / ?
(34 - 21) / ? = 13 / ?
(39 - 34) / ? = 5 / ?
(39 - 36) / ? = 3 / ?
(34 - 36) / ? = -2 / ?

Let's try to make a denominator that works.
If we have 18 / ?, we need ? = 18/16, not integer.
If we have 15 / ?, we need ? = 15/16, not integer.
If we have 3 / ?, we need ? = 3/16, not integer.

What if the division is at the end?
(something) / (something else) = 16.
Let's try to make a large number and divide it.
(39 * 21) / ? = 819 / ?
(36 * 21) / ? = 756 / ?
(34 * 21) / ? = 714 / ?
(39 * 34) / ? = 1326 / ?
(39 * 36) / ? = 1404 / ?
(34 * 36) / ? = 1224 / ?

Let's try to make a denominator from the remaining numbers.
If we use 39*21 = 819, we have 34 and 36 left.
Can we make 819/16 from 34 and 36? No.

Let's try to make a number that can be divided by one of the numbers.
For example, can we make 32 from 21, 39, 34, 36 and then divide by 2?
No, we need to use all numbers.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by one of the numbers, gives a result that can be combined with the others.
Example: 36 / 21 = not integer.
36 / 34 = not integer.
36 / 39 = not integer.

Let's try to make a number that is a multiple of 16.
Can we make 32?
34 - 2 = 32. Need to make 2 from 21, 39, 36.
39 - 36 - 21 = 3 - 21 = -18. No.

404,1260,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 9, 18, 3, and 75 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 25.

My approach will be to systematically try combinations of operations and number placements. I'll start by considering the larger numbers and how they might interact to get closer to 25.

The numbers are: 9, 18, 3, 75.
The target is: 25.

Let's look at the largest number, 75.
How can we get 25 from 75 using the other numbers?
Possible operations with 75:
1. 75 / 3 = 25. This uses 75 and 3. We are left with 9 and 18. We need to combine 9 and 18 to get 0, which is impossible with +, -, *, /. So this direct division doesn't work as the final step.

Let's try other combinations involving 75.
Maybe 75 is part of a larger calculation that is then divided.
Or maybe 75 is added or subtracted from something.

Consider the target 25.
What if we try to make numbers that, when combined with 75, get us closer to 25?
For example, if we subtract something from 75 to get 25, we need to subtract 50. Can we make 50 from 9, 18, and 3?
9 * 3 = 27. 18 + 27 = 45. Not 50.
18 * 3 = 54. 54 - 9 = 45. Not 50.
9 * 18 = 162. Too large.
18 / 3 = 6. 9 + 6 = 15. Not 50.
9 + 18 + 3 = 30. Not 50.

What if we add something to 75? That would make it larger than 25, so we'd need to subtract a lot.

Let's consider division again.
If 25 is the result of a division, say X / Y = 25.
If Y = 3, then X must be 75. We already explored this.
If Y = 9, then X must be 225. Can we make 225 from 18, 3, 75? 75 * 3 = 225. We are left with 18. So (75 * 3) / 9 = 225 / 9 = 25. This uses 75, 3, and 9. We are left with 18. We need to incorporate 18.
So, (75 * 3) / 9 = 25. We have 18 left. How can we use 18 without changing the result?
We could add 0, subtract 0, multiply by 1, or divide by 1.
Can we make 0 from 18? No.
Can we make 1 from 18? No.

Let's try another division.
If Y = 18, then X must be 25 * 18 = 450. Can we make 450 from 9, 3, 75? 75 * 9 = 675. 75 * 3 = 225. 9 * 3 = 27. No obvious way to make 450.

Let's try multiplication.
If 25 is the result of a multiplication, say X * Y = 25.
Possible factors of 25 are 1, 5, 25.
Can we make 5 from the numbers?
9 - 3 - 1 = 5 (but we don't have 1).
18 / 3 = 6. 9 - 6 = 3.
9 + 3 = 12. 18 - 12 = 6.
75 / 3 = 25.
75 / 9 is not an integer.
75 / 18 is not an integer.
18 / 9 = 2.
3 / 9 is not an integer.
3 / 18 is not an integer.

Let's try combining numbers to get factors of 25.
Can we make 5?
(9 + 18) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9.
(18 - 9) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3.
(9 * 3) - 18 = 27 - 18 = 9.
(18 * 3) - 75 = 54 - 75 (negative).
75 / 3 = 25.
75 / (9+18) = 75 / 27 (not integer).
75 / (18-9) = 75 / 9 (not integer).

Let's try to make 5 using some numbers and then multiply by 5 using another number.
If we can make 5 from three numbers, and have a 5 left. We don't have a 5.

Let's reconsider the division (75 * 3) / 9 = 25. We have 18 left.
What if we add 18 in a way that it cancels out?
For example, if we had (75 * 3) / 9 + (18 - 18). This uses 18 twice. Not allowed.
Or (75 * 3) / 9 * (18 / 18). This uses 18 twice. Not allowed.

Let's try to make 25 in a different way.
Maybe 75 is not the first number.
Consider 18 and 9. 18 + 9 = 27. 18 - 9 = 9. 18 * 9 = 162. 18 / 9 = 2.
Consider 18 and 3. 18 + 3 = 21. 18 - 3 = 15. 18 * 3 = 54. 18 / 3 = 6.
Consider 9 and 3. 9 + 3 = 12. 9 - 3 = 6. 9 * 3 = 27. 9 / 3 = 3.

Let's try to build up to 25.
We have 75.
If we divide 75 by something, we get smaller numbers.
75 / 3 = 25. We have 9 and 18 left. We need to combine them to get 0. Impossible.

What if we use 75 and 18?
75 + 18 = 93.
75 - 18 = 57.
75 * 18 = 1350.
75 / 18 (not integer).

What if we use 75 and 9?
75 + 9 = 84.
75 - 9 = 66.
75 * 9 = 675.
75 / 9 (not integer).

Let's try to make a number that, when operated with 75, gives 25.
We saw 75 / 3 = 25.
What if we make 3 from the other numbers?
We have 9, 18, 3. We need to make 3 using 9 and 18.
18 / 9 = 2. Not 3.
18 - 9 = 9. Not 3.
9 - (18/?)

Let's try to make 25 using multiplication as the last step.
X * Y = 25.
If Y = 5, X = 5. Can we make 5 from three numbers?
Numbers: 9, 18, 3, 75.
Let's try to make 5 from 9, 18, 3.
(18 - 9) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3. Not 5.
(9 + 18) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9. Not 5.
(9 * 3) - 18 = 27 - 18 = 9. Not 5.
(18 * 3) - 9 = 54 - 9 = 45. Not 5.

Let's try to make 5 from 9, 18, 75.

The user wants me to find an equation using the numbers 11, 42, and 64, and the operations +, -, *, / to reach the target number 95. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [11, 42, 64]
Target: 95

I need to explore combinations of these numbers with the allowed operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combining 11 and 42 first.
11 + 42 = 53. Then 53 op 64 = 95.
53 + 64 = 117 (too high)
53 - 64 = -11 (too low)
64 - 53 = 11 (too low)
53 * 64 (too high)
53 / 64 (fraction)
64 / 53 (fraction)

11 - 42 = -31. Then -31 op 64 = 95.
-31 + 64 = 33 (too low)
64 - 31 = 33 (too low)
-31 * 64 (too low)
-31 / 64 (fraction)
64 / -31 (fraction)

42 - 11 = 31. Then 31 op 64 = 95.
31 + 64 = 95. This looks promising!

Let's verify this:
(42 - 11) + 64
42 - 11 = 31
31 + 64 = 95

This uses all numbers (11, 42, 64) exactly once and only standard arithmetic operations.

Let's try other initial combinations just to be thorough.

Combine 11 and 64:
11 + 64 = 75. Then 75 op 42 = 95.
75 + 42 = 117 (too high)
75 - 42 = 33 (too low)
42 - 75 = -33 (too low)
75 * 42 (too high)
75 / 42 (fraction)
42 / 75 (fraction)

64 - 11 = 53. Then 53 op 42 = 95.
53 + 42 = 95. This is another solution!

Let's verify this:
(64 - 11) + 42
64 - 11 = 53
53 + 42 = 95

This also uses all numbers (11, 42, 64) exactly once and only standard arithmetic operations.

Combine 42 and 64:
42 + 64 = 106. Then 106 op 11 = 95.
106 - 11 = 95. This is a third solution!

Let's verify this:
(42 + 64) - 11
42 + 64 = 106
106 - 11 = 95

This also uses all numbers (11, 42, 64) exactly once and only standard arithmetic operations.

64 - 42 = 22. Then 22 op 11 = 95.
22 + 11 = 33 (too low)
22 - 11 = 11 (too low)
11 - 22 = -11 (too low)
22 * 11 = 242 (too high)
22 / 11 = 2 (too low)
11 / 22 = 0.5 (fraction)

42 * 64 (too high)
42 / 64 (fraction)
64 / 42 (fraction)

I have found three valid solutions:
1. (42 - 11) + 64 = 95
2. (64 - 11) + 42 = 95
3. (42 + 64) - 11 = 95

The prompt asks for ""a precise equation"". Any of these would be valid. I will present the first one I found.
The structure is (a op b) op c.
Numbers: 11, 42, 64
Target: 95

Step 1: Try combining 42 and 11.
42 - 11 = 31.
Step 2: Use the result (31) and the remaining number (64).
31 + 64 = 95.
This matches the target.
The equation is (42 - 11) + 64 = 95.
All numbers are used once. Operations are standard.

Let's double check the other solutions to ensure no errors.
Solution 2: (64 - 11) + 42
64 - 11 = 53
53 + 42 = 95. Correct.

Solution 3: (42 + 64) - 11
42 + 64 = 106
106 - 11 = 95. Correct.

The user wants me to find a mathematical equation using the numbers 76, 46, and 11, and the operations +, -, *, / to reach the target value of 19. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [76, 46, 11]
Target: 19

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 19
2. a op (b op c) = 19

Let's try combinations:

Try using division first, as 19 is relatively small.
- 76 / 46 is not an integer.
- 76 / 11 is not an integer.
- 46 / 11 is not an integer.
- 46 / 76 is not an integer.
- 11 / 76 is not an integer.
- 11 / 46 is not an integer.

So, division as the first operation on two numbers is unlikely to work unless it's part of a larger expression that results in an integer before the final step.

Let's try multiplication.
- 76 * 46 is too large.
- 76 * 11 is too large.
- 46 * 11 is too large.

This suggests that multiplication might be used in a way that reduces the numbers, or perhaps not used at all.

Let's focus on addition and subtraction.

Possibility 1: (a + b) - c = 19
- (76 + 46) - 11 = 122 - 11 = 111 (Too high)
- (76 + 11) - 46 = 87 - 46 = 41 (Too high)
- (46 + 11) - 76 = 57 - 76 = -19 (Close, but wrong sign)

Possibility 2: (a - b) + c = 19
- (76 - 46) + 11 = 30 + 11 = 41 (Too high)
- (76 - 11) + 46 = 65 + 46 = 111 (Too high)
- (46 - 76) + 11 = -30 + 11 = -19 (Close, but wrong sign)
- (46 - 11) + 76 = 35 + 76 = 111 (Too high)
- (11 - 76) + 46 = -65 + 46 = -19 (Close, but wrong sign)
- (11 - 46) + 76 = -35 + 76 = 41 (Too high)

Possibility 3: a - (b + c) = 19
- 76 - (46 + 11) = 76 - 57 = 19 (This works!)

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 76, 46, 11 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: -, + (basic arithmetic).
Result: 19.

The equation is 76 - (46 + 11) = 19.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one seems correct.

What about division in a different way?
Maybe something like (a * b) / c or a / (b * c)?
- (76 * 46) / 11 - too large
- (76 * 11) / 46 - not integer
- (46 * 11) / 76 - not integer

What about division as the last step?
- (a op b) / c = 19 => a op b = 19 * c
  - If c = 11, a op b = 19 * 11 = 209. Can we get 209 from 76 and 46? 76+46=122, 76-46=30, 46-76=-30, 76*46=3500. No.
  - If c = 46, a op b = 19 * 46 = 874. Can we get 874 from 76 and 11? 76+11=87, 76-11=65, 11-76=-65, 76*11=836. Close with multiplication, but not 874.
  - If c = 76, a op b = 19 * 76 = 1444. Can we get 1444 from 46 and 11? 46+11=57, 46-11=35, 11-46=-35, 46*11=506. No.

What about division as an intermediate step that results in an integer?
- 76 / 46 (no)
- 76 / 11 (no)
- 46 / 11 (no)
- 46 / 76 (no)
- 11 / 76 (no)
- 11 / 46 (no)

What if we use division with a number that is a factor of another?
For example, if we had 10 and 5, 10/5 = 2.
Here, no obvious integer divisions.

Let's re-check the subtraction/addition combinations.
We found 76 - (46 + 11) = 19.

Are there any other possibilities?
Consider the structure a - b - c = 19
- 76 - 46 - 11 = 30 - 11 = 19 (This also works!)

Let's verify this second solution:
Numbers used: 76, 46, 11 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: -, - (basic arithmetic).
Result: 19.

The equation is 76 - 46 - 11 = 19.

The prompt asks for *a* valid mathematical equation. Both are valid. I will present one. The first one I found was 76 - (46 + 11). The second one is 76 - 46 - 11. Both are equally valid. I'll choose the second one as it's slightly simpler without parentheses.

Let's double check the prompt: ""construct a valid mathematical equation that, when solved, precisely equals 19. You are restricted to using only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). It is imperative that each number from the provided set is used exactly one time in your equation.""

Both 76 - (46 + 11) = 19 and 76 - 46 - 11 = 19 satisfy all conditions.
I will present 76 - 46 - 11.

Let's consider if there's any ambiguity in ""solved"". Standard order of operations applies.
For 76 - 46 - 11:
76 - 46 = 30
30 - 11 = 19. Correct.

For 76 - (46 + 11):
46 + 11 = 57
76 - 57 = 19. Correct.

I will present 76 - 46 - 11.

The target is 55. The numbers are 3, 1, 24, and 16. I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's look at the numbers and the target. 55 is a relatively large number. Multiplication is likely to be involved.
The numbers are 1, 3, 16, 24.

Possible multiplications:
16 * 3 = 48. If I have 48, I need to get 55 - 48 = 7 from 24 and 1.
Can I get 7 from 24 and 1?
24 / 1 = 24 (no)
24 + 1 = 25 (no)
24 - 1 = 23 (no)
1 - 24 (negative)
So, 16 * 3 doesn't seem to lead to 55 easily.

16 * 24 is too large.
16 * 1 = 16. Need 55 - 16 = 39 from 3 and 24.
Can I get 39 from 3 and 24?
24 + 3 = 27 (no)
24 * 3 = 72 (no)
24 / 3 = 8 (no)
24 - 3 = 21 (no)

24 * 3 = 72. Need 55 - 72 = -17 from 16 and 1.
Can I get -17 from 16 and 1?
1 - 16 = -15 (close, but no)
16 - 1 = 15 (no)
16 * 1 = 16 (no)
16 / 1 = 16 (no)

24 * 1 = 24. Need 55 - 24 = 31 from 3 and 16.
Can I get 31 from 3 and 16?
16 + 3 = 19 (no)
16 * 3 = 48 (no)
16 - 3 = 13 (no)
3 - 16 (negative)

Let's try combining numbers first before multiplying.
Maybe something like (A + B) * C + D or (A - B) * C + D.

Consider 16 and 24. They are multiples of 8.
16 + 24 = 40. Need 55 - 40 = 15 from 3 and 1.
Can I get 15 from 3 and 1?
3 * 1 = 3 (no)
3 + 1 = 4 (no)
3 - 1 = 2 (no)
3 / 1 = 3 (no)

16 - 24 (negative)
24 - 16 = 8. Need 55 - 8 = 47 from 3 and 1.
Can I get 47 from 3 and 1? No.

What if 1 is used for subtraction or addition to modify a number before multiplication?
(16 - 1) = 15. Numbers left: 3, 24. Target: 55.
Can I get 55 from 15, 3, 24?
15 * 3 = 45. Need 55 - 45 = 10 from 24. No.
15 * 24 (too big)
15 + 3 = 18. Need 55 - 18 = 37 from 24. No.

16 * 3 = 48. 48 + 24 = 72 (no)
16 * 24 (too big)

24 * 3 = 72. Remaining: 16, 1. Target: 55.
72 - 16 = 56. 56 - 1 = 55. This works!
Numbers used: 24, 3, 16, 1. All used exactly once.
Operations: *, -, -. All basic.
Result: 55.

Let's write it out:
(24 * 3) - 16 - 1
72 - 16 - 1
56 - 1
55

This looks correct.

Let's check other possibilities just in case.
What if division is used?
24 / 3 = 8. Remaining: 16, 1. Target: 55.
8 * 16 = 128. 128 + 1 = 129 (no)
8 * 1 = 8. 8 + 16 = 24 (no)
8 + 16 = 24. 24 + 1 = 25 (no)
8 + 1 = 9. 9 + 16 = 25 (no)

16 / ? Not easily divisible by 3 or 24.
24 / 16 (not integer)
16 / 1 = 16. Remaining: 3, 24. Target: 55.
16 * 3 = 48. 48 + 24 = 72 (no)
16 + 3 = 19. 19 + 24 = 43 (no)

25 + 15 = 40. 40 - 2 = 38. Not 35.
25 * 2 = 50. 50 - 15 = 35. Yes!
So, 36 + (25 * 2 - 15) = 36 + (50 - 15) = 36 + 35 = 71.
This uses all numbers (36, 25, 2, 15) exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's check other possibilities just to be sure or to explore.
What if I start with multiplication?
36 * 2 = 72. This is close to 71.
Can I get -1 from 25 and 15?
25 - 15 = 10.
15 - 25 = -10.
25 / 15 is not an integer.
15 / 25 is not an integer.
So, 36 * 2 + (something from 25 and 15) doesn't seem to work easily.

What about 36 * 15? That's too big.
36 * 25? Too big.

Let's try combining the smaller numbers first.
25 * 2 = 50.
Now I have 50, 36, 15. Target 71.
50 + 36 = 86. 86 - 15 = 71.
This is 25 * 2 + 36 - 15 = 50 + 36 - 15 = 86 - 15 = 71.
This also works and uses all numbers exactly once.

Let's try another order for the previous one:
36 + 25 = 61.
Now I have 61, 2, 15. Target 71.
61 + 15 = 76. 76 - 2 = 74. Not 71.
61 - 15 = 46. 46 + 2 = 48. Not 71.
61 * 2 = 122. Too big.
61 / 2 is not integer.

Let's try 36 - 25 = 11.

11 + 15 = 26. 26 * 2 = 52. Not 71.
11 + 2 = 13. 13 * 15 = 195. Too big.

Let's go back to the first successful one: 36 + (25 * 2 - 15).
This is a valid solution.

Let's check the second successful one: 25 * 2 + 36 - 15.
This is also a valid solution.

The problem asks for ""the ultimate solution"". Either one is fine. I'll present the first one I found.
36 + (25 * 2 - 15) = 71.
Numbers used: 36, 25, 2, 15. All used once.
Operations used: +, *, -. All basic.
Result: 71.

Let's write it out clearly.
Numbers: 36, 25, 2, 15. Target: 71.

Attempt 1:
Try to make 71 by adding to 36.
71 - 36 = 35.
Can we make 35 from 25, 2, 15?
25 * 2 = 50.
50 - 15 = 35.
So, 36 + (25 * 2 - 15) = 36 + (50 - 15) = 36 + 35 = 71.
This works.

Attempt 2:
Try to make 71 by multiplying 36 by something.
36 * 2 = 72.
We need to subtract 1. Can we make 1 from 25 and 15? No, not easily with one operation.
What if we use all three remaining numbers?
25 - 15 = 10. 10 / 2 = 5.
25 / (15 - 2) = 25 / 13 (not integer).
(25 - 15) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.
(25 + 15) / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.
25 * 15 = 375.
25 * 2 = 50. 50 - 15 = 35.
15 * 2 = 30. 30 - 25 = 5.
15 + 25 = 40. 40 / 2 = 20.
15 - 25 = -10. -10 * 2 = -20.

Let's re-evaluate 36 * 2 = 72. We need to get -1 from 25 and 15.
This means we need to subtract something that results in 1.
If we have 72, we need to subtract 1.
Can we make 1 from 25 and 15? No.
What if we do 36 * 2 - (something)?
We need 36 * 2 - X = 71, so 72 - X = 71, X = 1.
Can we make 1 from 25 and 15? No.

Let's consider the second solution found: 25 * 2 + 36 - 15.
25 * 2 = 50.
50 + 36 = 86.
86 - 15 = 71.
This is also a valid solution.

I will present the first one found.
36 + (25 * 2 - 15)
Parentheses are important for order of operations.
The problem states ""basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)"". It doesn't explicitly mention parentheses, but they are implied for controlling the order of operations to achieve a specific result. If parentheses were not allowed, the order would be strictly left-to-right or standard PEMDAS.

Let's assume standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) applies, and parentheses can be used to group operations.

The first solution: 36 + (25 * 2 - 15)
PEMDAS:
1. Parentheses: 25 * 2 = 50
2. Parentheses: 50 - 15 = 35
3. Addition: 36 + 35 = 71.
This is correct.

The second solution: 25 * 2 + 36 - 15
PEMDAS:
1. Multiplication: 25 * 2 = 50
2. Addition: 50 + 36 = 86
3. Subtraction: 86 - 15 = 71.
This is also correct.

I will choose the first one.

880,172,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 53, 52, 79, and 23 to equal 21. I can only use +, -, *, /. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combining the numbers.
The target is 21. The numbers are relatively large. This suggests division or subtraction might be important to reduce the values.

Possible combinations:
- Try to get close to 21 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.
- (53 - 52) = 1. Then I have 79 and 23 left. 1 + 79 + 23 = 103 (too big). 1 + 79 - 23 = 57 (too big). 1 - 79 + 23 = -55 (too small). 1 - 79 - 23 = -101 (too small).
- (53 + 52) = 105. Left with 79, 23. 105 - 79 - 23 = 3 (close, but not 21). 105 - 79 + 23 = 49. 105 + 79 - 23 = 161.
- (79 - 53) = 26. Left with 52, 23. 26 + 52 - 23 = 55. 26 - 52 + 23 = -3. 26 - 52 - 23 = -49.
- (79 - 52) = 27. Left with 53, 23. 27 + 53 - 23 = 57. 27 - 53 + 23 = -3. 27 - 53 - 23 = -49.
- (53 / 23) - not an integer.
- (52 / 23) - not an integer.
- (79 / 23) - not an integer.
- (79 / 53) - not an integer.
- (79 / 52) - not an integer.
- (53 / 52) - not an integer.

Let's try multiplication.
- 23 * 1 = 23. Can I make 1 from 53, 52, 79? (53-52) = 1. So, 23 * (53 - 52) = 23. Then I have 79 left. 23 + 79 = 102. 23 - 79 = -56.
- 23 * 2 = 46. Can I make 2 from 53, 52, 79? (53-52) = 1. (79-53) = 26. (79-52) = 27.
- 23 * 3 = 69.
- 23 * 4 = 92.

Let's try to get a number close to 21 by dividing a larger number by a smaller one.
- 79 / ?
- 53 / ?
- 52 / ?

What if I combine two numbers to make a larger number and then subtract or divide?
- (53 + 79) = 132. Left with 52, 23. 132 - 52 - 23 = 57.
- (52 + 79) = 131. Left with 53, 23. 131 - 53 - 23 = 55.
- (53 * 2) = 106.
- (52 * 2) = 104.
- (79 * 2) = 158.

Let's try to make a number that, when operated on with another, gets us closer to 21.
Consider 79. If I subtract something from it, I might get closer.
79 - 53 = 26. Left with 52, 23. 26 - 52 + 23 = -3. 26 + 52 - 23 = 55.
79 - 52 = 27. Left with 53, 23. 27 - 53 + 23 = -3. 27 + 53 - 23 = 57.
79 - 23 = 56. Left with 53, 52. 56 - 53 + 52 = 55. 56 + 53 - 52 = 57.

Consider 53.
53 - 23 = 30. Left with 52, 79. 30 - 52 + 79 = 57. 30 + 52 - 79 = 3.
53 - 52 = 1. Left with 79, 23. 1 + 79 - 23 = 57. 1 - 79 + 23 = -55.

Consider 52.
52 - 23 = 29. Left with 53, 79. 29 - 53 + 79 = 55. 29 + 53 - 79 = 3.

Let's try division again, but maybe with intermediate results.
What if I can make a number that divides nicely?
For example, if I can make 42, then 42 / 2 = 21.
Can I make 42 from 53, 52, 79, 23?
(53 - ?)
(52 - ?)
(79 - ?)
(23 * ?)

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by one of the numbers, gives a result that can be adjusted.
If I can make 42, then 42 / 2 = 21. Can I make 42 and 2 from the numbers?
Numbers: 53, 52, 79, 23.
If I use 23, I need to make 42 from 53, 52, 79.
53 + 52 - 79 = 26.
79 - 53 + 52 = 78.
79 - 52 + 53 = 80.

What if I try to make a number that, when multiplied by one of the numbers, gets close to 21?
23 * 1 = 23. (53-52) = 1. So 23 * (53-52) = 23. Left with 79. 23 + 79 = 102. 23 - 79 = -56.

Let's try to make a number that, when added to or subtracted from another, gives 21.
If I have 53, I need to get -32. Can I make -32 from 52, 79, 23?
52 - 79 - 23 = -50.
52 + 23 - 79 = -4.
79 - 52 - 23 = 4.

If I have 52, I need to get -31. Can I make -31 from 53, 79, 23?
53 - 79 - 23 = -49.
53 + 23 - 79 = -3.
79 - 53 - 23 = 3.

If I have 79, I need to get -58. Can I make -58 from 53, 52, 23?
53 - 52 - 23 = -22.
53 + 23 - 52 = 24.
52 - 53 - 23 = -24.

If I have 23, I need to get -2. Can I make -2 from 53, 52, 79?
53 - 52 - 79 = -78.
52 - 53 - 79 = -80.
53 + 52 - 79 = 26.

The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers [76, 90, 60, 35] to reach the target result of 11.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 76, 90, 60, 35
Target: 11

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to get 11.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite large, so division might be useful to reduce them.
Or, multiplication might be used to create larger numbers that can then be reduced.

Possible starting points:
1. Try to get close to 11 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.
2. Try to create a number that is a multiple of 11 or close to it.
3. Look for divisions that result in integers.

Let's examine the numbers:
76
90
60
35

Divisions:
90 / 60 is not an integer.
90 / 35 is not an integer.
90 / 76 is not an integer.
60 / 35 is not an integer.
60 / 76 is not an integer.
35 / 76 is not an integer.
76 / 35 is not an integer.
76 / 60 is not an integer.
76 / 90 is not an integer.
35 / 60 is not an integer.
35 / 90 is not an integer.
60 / 90 is not an integer.

This means direct division between any two numbers won't yield a simple integer to work with immediately. However, division can be used in conjunction with other operations.

Let's try to combine numbers to get something that divides nicely.
For example, can we make a multiple of 11?
11 * 1 = 11
11 * 2 = 22
11 * 3 = 33
11 * 4 = 44
11 * 5 = 55
11 * 6 = 66
11 * 7 = 77
11 * 8 = 88
11 * 9 = 99

Let's see if we can form any of these numbers or numbers that can lead to them.

Consider 90 and 76.
90 - 76 = 14. Not very helpful.
90 + 76 = 166.
90 * 76 = large.
90 / 76 = not integer.

Consider 60 and 35.
60 - 35 = 25.
60 + 35 = 95.
60 * 35 = large.
60 / 35 = not integer.

Consider 90 and 60.
90 - 60 = 30.
90 + 60 = 150.
90 * 60 = large.
90 / 60 = 1.5.

Consider 76 and 35.
76 - 35 = 41.
76 + 35 = 111. This is 11 * 10 + 1, or 11 * 10.1. Interesting.
76 * 35 = large.
76 / 35 = not integer.

Let's explore 76 + 35 = 111.
We have 90 and 60 left.
Can we combine 90 and 60 with 111 to get 11?
111 + 90 + 60 = large.
111 - 90 - 60 = 111 - 150 = -39.
111 + 90 - 60 = 201 - 60 = 141.
111 - 90 + 60 = 21 + 60 = 81.
111 * 90 * 60 = very large.
111 / 90 = not integer.
111 / 60 = not integer.

What if we use division to get smaller numbers?
Maybe we can create a number that divides another number to get something useful.

Let's try to make a number that divides 90 or 60 or 76 or 35.
For example, can we make 30? 90 / 30 = 3.
We have 76, 60, 35. Can we make 30 from these?
60 - 35 + 76 = 25 + 76 = 101.
60 + 35 - 76 = 95 - 76 = 19.
60 / (76 - 35) = 60 / 41. No.
(60 - 35) * ? = 25 * ?

Let's try to make a number that divides 76.
Factors of 76: 1, 2, 4, 19, 38, 76.
Can we make 19 from 90, 60, 35?

60 - 35 = 25.
90 - 60 = 30.
90 - 35 = 55.
60 + 35 = 95.
90 + 60 = 150.
90 + 35 = 125.
(90 + 60) / ?
(90 - 60) / ? = 30 / ?
(60 - 35) = 25.
(90 - 35) = 55.

Let's try to make 38.
Can we make 38 from 90, 60, 35?
90 - 60 + 35 = 30 + 35 = 65.
90 + 60 - 35 = 150 - 35 = 115.
60 + 35 - 90 = 95 - 90 = 5.

Let's try to make a number that divides 35.
Factors of 35: 1, 5, 7, 35.
Can we make 5 from 76, 90, 60?
90 - 76 - 60 = 14 - 60 = -46.
90 - 60 - 76 = 30 - 76 = -46.
76 - 60 - 90 = 16 - 90 = -74.
90 - (76 + 60) = 90 - 136 = -46.
(90 + 60) - 76 = 150 - 76 = 74.
(90 - 60) + 76 = 30 + 76 = 106.
(76 - 60) + 90 = 16 + 90 = 106.
(76 + 60) - 90 = 136 - 90 = 46.

Can we make 7 from 76, 90, 60?
90 - 76 = 14. 14 / 2 = 7. But we don't have 2.
(90 - 76) / ?
(90 + 60) / ?
(76 + 60) / ?

Let's try to make 11 directly or indirectly.
Maybe a large number divided by a number close to it.
Or a number close to 11 multiplied by something.

Let's try to make 11 using multiplication and subtraction/addition.
Example: (A * B) - C + D = 11

Consider 90 and 60.

The user wants a mathematical expression that evaluates to 59 using the numbers 31, 92, 8, and 4 exactly once. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: [31, 92, 8, 4]
Target: 59

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. I should try different groupings and orders of operations.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to 59 and then use the remaining numbers to adjust.
3. Consider multiplication first, as it can change the magnitude significantly.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using 92 and 31 first.
92 - 31 = 61. Remaining numbers are 8 and 4.
Can I get -2 from 8 and 4?
8 / 4 = 2. So, 61 - 2 = 59.
This looks promising. The expression would be (92 - 31) - (8 / 4).
Let's check:
92 - 31 = 61
8 / 4 = 2
61 - 2 = 59.
This uses all numbers (31, 92, 8, 4) exactly once.
It uses subtraction and division.
The result is 59.
This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to be sure or to see if there are simpler ones (though simplicity wasn't a requirement, it's good practice).

Attempt 2: Try multiplication with 8 and 4.
8 * 4 = 32. Remaining numbers are 31 and 92.
Can I get 59 from 31 and 92 and 32?
Maybe 92 - 31 + 32? 61 + 32 = 93. Too high.
Maybe 92 + 31 - 32? 123 - 32 = 91. Too high.
Maybe 31 + 92 - (8*4)? 123 - 32 = 91.
Maybe 92 - (31 - (8*4))? 92 - (31 - 32) = 92 - (-1) = 93.
Maybe (92 - 31) + (8*4)? 61 + 32 = 93.

Attempt 3: Try multiplication with 31 and 4.
31 * 4 = 124. Remaining numbers are 92 and 8.
Can I get 59 from 124, 92, and 8?
124 - 92 = 32. Remaining is 8. 32 + 8 = 40. Not 59.
124 - 8 = 116. Remaining is 92. 116 - 92 = 24. Not 59.
92 - 8 = 84. 124 - 84 = 40. Not 59.

Attempt 4: Try multiplication with 31 and 8.
31 * 8 = 248. Remaining numbers are 92 and 4.
This is a large number.
248 - 92 = 156. Remaining is 4. 156 - 4 = 152.
248 - 4 = 244. Remaining is 92. 244 - 92 = 152.
92 - 4 = 88. 248 - 88 = 160.

Attempt 5: Try division with 92 and 4.
92 / 4 = 23. Remaining numbers are 31 and 8.
Can I get 59 from 23, 31, and 8?
23 + 31 = 54. Remaining is 8. 54 + 8 = 62. Close.
23 + 8 = 31. Remaining is 31. 31 + 31 = 62.
31 + 8 = 39. 23 + 39 = 62.
What about subtraction?
31 - 8 = 23. 23 + 23 = 46.
31 + 23 = 54. 54 + 8 = 62.
31 + 23 - 8 = 54 - 8 = 46.
31 - 23 = 8. 8 + 8 = 16.
8 - (31 - 23) = 8 - 8 = 0.
(31 + 8) + 23 = 39 + 23 = 62.
(31 - 8) + 23 = 23 + 23 = 46.
31 + (23 - 8) = 31 + 15 = 46.
31 - (23 - 8) = 31 - 15 = 16.
31 + (8 - 23) = 31 + (-15) = 16.

Attempt 6: Try division with 92 and 8.
92 / 8 = 11.5. This involves decimals, which might be allowed but usually, these puzzles stick to integers unless specified. Let's avoid decimals for now.

Attempt 7: Try division with 8 and 4.
8 / 4 = 2. Remaining numbers are 31 and 92.
Can I get 59 from 2, 31, and 92?
92 - 31 = 61. 61 - 2 = 59. This is the same as Attempt 1.
92 + 31 = 123. 123 - 2 = 121.
31 - 2 = 29. 92 - 29 = 63.
92 - 2 = 90. 90 - 31 = 59.
This gives another solution: (92 - (8 / 4)) - 31.
Let's check:
8 / 4 = 2
92 - 2 = 90
90 - 31 = 59.
This also uses all numbers once and correct operations.

Let's compare the two solutions found:
Solution 1: (92 - 31) - (8 / 4)
Solution 2: (92 - (8 / 4)) - 31

Both are valid. The first one seems slightly more straightforward in terms of grouping.

Let's try one more structure.
Maybe something like A * B + C - D or A * B - C + D.

Attempt 8: Try 31 * 2 (from 8/4).
31 * (8/4) = 31 * 2 = 62. Remaining number is 92.
Can I get 59 from 62 and 92?
62 - 92 = -30.
92 - 62 = 30.
This doesn't work.

Attempt 9: Try 4 * 8 = 32. Remaining 31, 92.
92 - 31 = 61. 61 - 32 = 29.
31 + 92 = 123. 123 - 32 = 91.

Attempt 10: Try 31 + 92 = 123. Remaining 8, 4.
123 - 8 = 115. 115 / 4 is not an integer.
123 - 4 = 119. 119 / 8 is not an integer.
123 - (8*4) = 123 - 32 = 91.
123 - (8/4) = 123 - 2 = 121.

Attempt 11: Try 92 - 8 = 84. Remaining 31, 4.
84 - 31 = 53. 53 + 4 = 57. Close.
84 - 4 = 80. 80 - 31 = 49.
84 + 4 = 88. 88 - 31 = 57.
84 + 31 = 115. 115 - 4 = 111.

I need to explore different combinations of these numbers and operations. Let's list the numbers: 48, 15, 41. Target: 74.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then incorporating the third.

Combination 1: Using 48 and 15 first.
- 48 + 15 = 63. Remaining number is 41. To get 74 from 63 and 41:
    - 63 + 41 = 104 (Too high)

- 48 - 15 = 33. Remaining number is 41. To get 74 from 33 and 41:
    - 33 + 41 = 74 (This works!)
    The equation would be (48 - 15) + 41 = 74.
    Let's check the constraints:
    - Uses 48, 15, 41 exactly once. (Yes)
    - Uses standard arithmetic operations. (Yes)
    - Equals 74. (Yes)
    This seems like a valid solution.

Let's continue exploring other combinations to be thorough, although I've found a solution.

- 48 * 15 = 720 (Too high)
- 48 / 15 = not integer

Combination 2: Using 48 and 41 first.
- 48 + 41 = 89. Remaining number is 15. To get 74 from 89 and 15:
    - 89 - 15 = 74 (This works!)
    The equation would be (48 + 41) - 15 = 74.
    Let's check the constraints:
    - Uses 48, 41, 15 exactly once. (Yes)
    - Uses standard arithmetic operations. (Yes)
    - Equals 74. (Yes)
    This is another valid solution.

- 48 - 41 = 7. Remaining number is 15. To get 74 from 7 and 15:
    - 7 + 15 = 22 (Too low)
    - 15 - 7 = 8 (Too low)
    - 7 * 15 = 105 (Too high)
    - 7 / 15 = not integer
    - 15 / 7 = not integer
- 48 * 41 = large (Too high)
- 48 / 41 = not integer

    - 56 + 48 = 104 (Too high)
    - 56 - 48 = 8 (Too low)
    - 48 - 56 = -8 (Not useful)
    - 56 * 48 = large (Too high)
    - 56 / 48 = not integer
    - 48 / 56 = not integer
- 15 - 41 = -26. Remaining number is 48. To get 74 from -26 and 48:
    - -26 + 48 = 22 (Too low)
    - 48 - (-26) = 48 + 26 = 74 (This works!)
    The equation would be 48 - (15 - 41) = 74.
    Let's check the constraints:
    - Uses 48, 15, 41 exactly once. (Yes)
    - Uses standard arithmetic operations. (Yes)
    - Equals 74. (Yes)
    This is a third valid solution.

- 41 - 15 = 26. Remaining number is 48. To get 74 from 26 and 48:
    - 26 + 48 = 74 (This works!)
    The equation would be (41 - 15) + 48 = 74.
    Let's check the constraints:
    - Uses 41, 15, 48 exactly once. (Yes)
    - Uses standard arithmetic operations. (Yes)
    - Equals 74. (Yes)
    This is a fourth valid solution.

- 15 * 41 = 615 (Too high)
- 15 / 41 = not integer
- 41 / 15 = not integer

I have found multiple valid solutions:
1. (48 - 15) + 41 = 74
2. (48 + 41) - 15 = 74
3. 48 - (15 - 41) = 74
4. (41 - 15) + 48 = 74

The problem asks for ""an equation"". I will pick one of them. The first one found, (48 - 15) + 41, is straightforward.

Self-check for (48 - 15) + 41 = 74:
- Numbers used: 48, 15, 41. Each used exactly once. (Pass)
- Operations used: Subtraction, Addition. Standard arithmetic operations. (Pass)
- Result: 48 - 15 = 33. 33 + 41 = 74. The target value is 74. (Pass)

All constraints are met. I will present this equation.

I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(76 + 76) - 96 = 152 - 96 = 56.
This uses all numbers and only allowed operations.

Let's verify:
76 + 76 = 152
152 - 96 = 56

This looks correct.

Let's try another one just to be sure there aren't other simple ones.

Attempt 2:
96 - (76 - 76) = 96 - 0 = 96. Not 56.
96 / (76 - 76) - division by zero, not allowed.
(96 - 76) + 76 = 20 + 76 = 96. Not 56.
(96 + 76) - 76 = 172 - 76 = 96. Not 56.
76 * (96 / 76) - This would involve fractions if 96 is not divisible by 76. 96/76 is not an integer.
76 / (96 / 76) - This would also involve fractions.

The first attempt seems to be the most straightforward and correct.
(76 + 76) - 96 = 56.

2483,433,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 88, 8, and 30 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target number 66.

I need to explore different combinations of operations and number order.

Let's list the numbers: 88, 8, 30.
Target: 66.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with 88:**
    *   88 + 8 + 30 = 126 (Too high)
    *   88 + 8 - 30 = 66 (This looks promising!)
    *   88 - 8 + 30 = 110 (Too high)
    *   88 - 8 - 30 = 50 (Too low)
    *   88 * 8 ... (This will be very large, unlikely to get to 66)
    *   88 / 8 = 11. Then 11 + 30 = 41 (Too low). 11 - 30 = -19 (Too low). 11 * 30 = 330 (Too high).

2.  **Start with 30:**
    *   30 + 88 + 8 = 126 (Too high)
    *   30 + 88 - 8 = 110 (Too high)
    *   30 - 88 ... (Negative, unlikely)
    *   30 * 8 = 240. Then 240 + 88 (Too high). 240 - 88 = 152 (Too high). 240 / 88 (Not a whole number, unlikely).
    *   30 / 8 (Not a whole number, unlikely).

3.  **Start with 8:**
    *   8 + 88 + 30 = 126 (Too high)
    *   8 + 88 - 30 = 66 (This is the same as the second combination in step 1, just reordered: 88 + 8 - 30 = 66)
    *   8 - 88 ... (Negative, unlikely)
    *   8 * 88 ... (Too large)
    *   8 * 30 = 240. Then 240 + 88 (Too high). 240 - 88 = 152 (Too high). 240 / 88 (Not a whole number).
    *   8 / 88 (Fraction, unlikely).

The combination `88 + 8 - 30` yielded 66.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 88 (yes), 8 (yes), 30 (yes).
Let's check if only basic operations are used: + (yes), - (yes).

The order of operations matters. In `88 + 8 - 30`, addition and subtraction are performed from left to right.
88 + 8 = 96
96 - 30 = 66.

This works.

Another possibility could be `8 + 88 - 30`.
8 + 88 = 96
96 - 30 = 66.
This also works and uses the same numbers and operations.

Let's consider if there are any other possibilities.
What about multiplication or division first?
If we do `88 / 8 = 11`, then `11 + 30 = 41` or `11 - 30 = -19` or `30 - 11 = 19`. None are 66.
If we do `30 / 8` or `8 / 30` or `88 / 30` or `30 / 88` or `8 / 88`, these don't result in integers, making it harder to reach 66 with simple operations.

What about `8 * 30 = 240`?
`240 + 88` (too big)
`240 - 88 = 152` (too big)
`88 - 240` (negative)

What about `88 * 8`? Too big.
What about `88 * 30`? Too big.

It seems the most straightforward solution involves addition and subtraction.
The equation `88 + 8 - 30 = 66` satisfies all conditions.
The equation `8 + 88 - 30 = 66` also satisfies all conditions.
I will present one of them.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with larger numbers and adjust.
2. Try multiplication to get closer to the target.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers close to 48 or factors of numbers that could lead to 48.

Let's try some combinations:

- (33 + 25) = 58. Then I have 35 and 4 left. 58 - 35 = 23. 23 + 4 = 27 (not 48). 58 - 4 = 54. 54 - 35 = 19 (not 48).
- (33 - 25) = 8. Then I have 35 and 4 left. 8 + 35 + 4 = 47 (close again). 8 * 4 = 32. 32 + 35 = 67 (not 48).

19. 13 * 3 + 20 = 39 + 20 = 59
20. 13 * 3 - 20 = 39 - 20 = 19

The equation (20 * 3) - 13 = 47 works.
Let's check if any other order works.
3 * 20 - 13 = 47. This is the same calculation.

What about division?
(20 + 13) / 3 = 33 / 3 = 11

(20 / 13) ...
(3 / 20) ...

The most straightforward solution is (20 * 3) - 13.
Let's ensure all numbers are used and operators are standard. Yes, 20, 3, 13 are used once. Operators are * and -.

Target: T = 79

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for the operations, and each operation can be one of the four types. This gives a large number of combinations, but since there are only three numbers, the structure of the equation will be relatively simple: (a op1 b) op2 c or a op1 (b op2 c).

Let's try some combinations systematically.

Possible structures:
1. (83 op1 88) op2 74 = 79
2. 83 op1 (88 op2 74) = 79

Let's check: (88 - 83) + 74 = 5 + 74 = 79.
This uses 88, 83, and 74 exactly once. The operations are subtraction and addition. This fits the criteria.

Let's verify the other permutations and structures just to be thorough and ensure there isn't a simpler or more elegant solution, although the first one found is valid.

Let's check: (74 - 83) + 88 = -9 + 88 = 79.
This also uses the numbers and operations correctly.

- (88 + 74) - 83 = 162 - 83 = 79 (Found another one! Using 88, 74, 83)
Let's check: (88 + 74) - 83 = 162 - 83 = 79.
This also uses the numbers and operations correctly.

Permutation 6: 74, 88, 83
- (74 + 88) - 83 = 162 - 83 = 79 (Same as permutation 4)

96 / 6 = 16. 33 - 16 = 17 (no)
96 / 33 (no)
33 / 6 (no)

Let's try X - 96 = 57 => X = 153. Can we get 153 from [6, 81, 33]?
81 + 33 + 6 = 120 (no)
81 * ? (too big)

Let's try X - 81 = 57 => X = 138. Can we get 138 from [96, 6, 33]?
96 + 33 + 6 = 135 (close)
96 + 33 = 129. 129 + 6 = 135.
96 + 6 = 102. 102 + 33 = 135.
96 * ? (too big)

Let's try X - 33 = 57 => X = 90. Can we get 90 from [96, 6, 81]?
96 - 6 = 90. Yes!
So, (96 - 6) - 81 = 90 - 81 = 9. Not 57.
We need to use 81.
So, (96 - 6) + 81 = 90 + 81 = 171.
(96 - 6) * 81 (too big)
(96 - 6) / 81 (no)

Let's try X - 6 = 57 => X = 63. Can we get 63 from [96, 81, 33]?
81 - ?
81 - 33 = 48 (no)
96 - 33 = 63. Yes!
So, (96 - 33) - 6 = 63 - 6 = 57.
This uses 96, 33, 6. We still have 81. This doesn't work.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 57.
Or (A + B) * C - D = 57.

Let's try using 6 as a multiplier or divisor.
If 6 is a multiplier:
(A + B + C) * 6 = 57 (no, 57 not divisible by 6)
(A + B - C) * 6 = 57 (no)
(A * B + C) * 6 = 57 (no)

If 6 is a divisor:
(A + B + C) / 6 = 57 => A + B + C = 342. (too big)
(A * B + C) / 6 = 57 => A * B + C = 342. (too big)

Let's try 33.
If 33 is a multiplier:
(A + B + C) * 33 = 57 (no)

If 33 is a divisor:
(A + B + C) / 33 = 57 => A + B + C = 1881 (too big)

Let's try 81.
If 81 is a multiplier:
(A + B + C) * 81 = 57 (no)

If 81 is a divisor:
(A + B + C) / 81 = 57 => A + B + C = 4617 (too big)

Let's try 96.
If 96 is a multiplier:
(A + B + C) * 96 = 57 (no)

If 96 is a divisor:
(A + B + C) / 96 = 57 => A + B + C = 5472 (too big)

Let's go back to subtraction.
We had 96 - 33 = 63. We need to get 57 from 63 and [6, 81].
63 - 6 = 57. We used 96, 33, 6. We have 81 left.
So, (96 - 33) - 6 = 57. We need to incorporate 81.
How about (96 - 33) - 6 + 81? = 57 + 81 = 138.
How about (96 - 33) - (81 - 6)? = 63 - 75 = -12.
How about (96 - 33) - (81 / 6)? (not integer)

Let's try 81 - 33 = 48. We need to get 57 from 48 and",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 83.
If I subtract something from 83, I need to get a number close to 11.
83 - X = 11 => X = 72.
Can I make 72 from 66 and 77 using +, -, *, /?
66 + 77 = 143 (too large)
77 - 66 = 11 (not 72)
66 * 77 (too large)
77 / 66 (not an integer, not 72)
66 / 77 (not an integer, not 72)
So, 83 - (something from 66 and 77) doesn't seem to work.

Possibility 2: Start with 77.
77 - X = 11 => X = 66.
Can I make 66 from 83 and 66? This is trivial, but I need to use 83 and 66 to make 66. This is not possible as I need to use both numbers.
Let's rephrase: 77 - (something from 83 and 66) = 11.
So, (something from 83 and 66) must equal 66.
83 + 66 = 149
83 - 66 = 17
66 - 83 = -17
83 * 66 (too large)
83 / 66 (not integer)
66 / 83 (not integer)
This doesn't work.

Possibility 3: Start with 66.
66 + X = 11 => X = -55.
Can I make -55 from 83 and 77?
83 + 77 = 160
83 - 77 = 6
77 - 83 = -6
83 * 77 (too large)
83 / 77 (not integer)
77 / 83 (not integer)
This doesn't work.

Let's try multiplication or division first.
Maybe a division results in a small number that can be combined.

Consider (77 / 7) = 11. But I don't have 7.
Consider (66 / 6) = 11. But I don't have 6.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then the third.
(83 + 66) = 149. 149 ? 77 = 11.
149 - 77 = 72 (no)
149 + 77 = 226 (no)
149 * 77 (too large)
149 / 77 (not integer)

(83 - 66) = 17. 17 ? 77 = 11.
17 + 77 = 94 (no)
77 - 17 = 60 (no)
17 - 77 = -60 (no)
17 * 77 (too large)
17 / 77 (not integer)
77 / 17 (not integer)

(66 - 83) = -17. -17 ? 77 = 11.
-17 + 77 = 60 (no)
77 - (-17) = 94 (no)
-17 - 77 = -94 (no)

(83 * 66) - 77 (too large)
(83 / 66) - 77 (not integer)

(77 + 66) = 143. 143 ? 83 = 11.
143 - 83 = 60 (no)
143 + 83 = 226 (no)

(77 - 66) = 11. 11 ? 83 = 11.
This is promising! I have 11 from (77 - 66). Now I need to use 83 to get 11.
This means I need to combine 11 and 83 to get 11.
The only way to do this is if the operation with 83 results in 0, and then I add it to 11.
But I can't make 0 from 83 alone.
Or, if the operation with 83 results in 1, and I multiply it by 11. But I can't make 1 from 83 alone.
Or, if the operation with 83 results in 11, and I add 0.

Let's rethink the structure. Maybe the 83 is involved in a division that reduces it significantly.
What if 83 is part of a subtraction that results in a number that can be divided?

Let's try to get a number that divides nicely.
If I can get 77 / X = 11, then X must be 7. Can I make 7 from 83 and 66?
83 - 66 = 17 (no)
66 - 83 = -17 (no)
83 + 66 = 149 (no)
83 * 66 (too large)
83 / 66 (not integer)
66 / 83 (not integer)

If I can get 66 / X = 11, then X must be 6. Can I make 6 from 83 and 77?
83 - 77 = 6. Yes!
So, I can have 66 / (83 - 77).
Let's check: 66 / (83 - 77) = 66 / 6 = 11.
This uses 66, 83, and 77 exactly once.
The operations are /, -, and the result is 11.

Let's verify the conditions:
1. Numbers used: 83, 66, 77. Yes, all used exactly once.
2. Operations used: +, -, *, /. Yes, only these are used.
3. Evaluates to 11. Yes, 66 / (83 - 77) = 66 / 6 = 11.

This looks correct.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.
What if 83 is the divisor?
X / 83 = 11 => X = 913. Can I make 913 from 66 and 77? No.

What if 77 is the divisor?
X / 77 = 11 => X = 847. Can I make 847 from 83 and 66? No.

What if 66 is the divisor?
X / 66 = 11 => X = 726. Can I make 726 from 83 and 77? No.

What about addition/subtraction leading to 11?

(83 + 77) - 66 = 160 - 66 = 94 (no)

Let's try combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest numbers:**
    *   73 - 34 = 39. Need to get 6 from 7 and 12. (12 - 7 = 5, 7 + 12 = 19, 12 * 7 = 84, 12 / 7 is not integer). Doesn't work.

2.  **Try combining smaller numbers first:**

    *   12 * 7 = 84. Need to get -39 from 34 and 73. (34 - 73 = -39). This works!
        Equation: (12 * 7) + (34 - 73) = 84 + (-39) = 45.
        Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 12, 7, 34, 73. Yes.

*   34 / 7 is not integer.

The first solution found seems correct and valid.
(12 * 7) + (34 - 73) = 45
Let's reorder it to be more standard if possible, but the current form is fine.
(7 * 12) + (34 - 73) = 45
7 * 12 + 34 - 73 = 45 (Order of operations: 84 + 34 - 73 = 118 - 73 = 45)

Another possibility:
73 - (12 * 7 / ?) No.
73 - 34 = 39. Need 6 from 12 and 7. (12-7=5, 7-12=-5, 12/7 not int, 7/12 not int).

12 / (7 - 34/73) No.

Let's re-verify 7 * 12 + 34 - 73 = 45.
Numbers used: 7, 12, 34, 73. All used once.
Operations: *, +, -. Basic operations.
Result: 45.

Consider other groupings:
(73 - 34) + (12 - 7) = 39 + 5 = 44. Close.
(73 - 12) + (7 - 34) = 61 + (-27) = 34.
(34 - 7) + (73 - 12) = 27 + 61 = 88.
(34 - 12) + (73 - 7) = 22 + 66 = 88.

What about division?
(73 + 7) / ? = 80 / ?
(34 + 12) / ? = 46 / ?
(73 - 7) / ? = 66 / ?
(34 - 12) / ? = 22 / ?

Let's try division with one of the numbers.
(73 + 34 + 12) / 7 = 119 / 7 = 17. Not 45.
(73 + 34 - 12) / 7 = 95 / 7. Not integer.
(73 - 34 + 12) / 7 = 51 / 7. Not integer.
(34 + 12 - 7) / 73 = 39 / 73. Not integer.

Let's go back to the successful one: 7 * 12 + 34 - 73 = 45.
This is a valid solution.
The order of operations is important.
7 * 12 = 84
84 + 34 = 118
118 - 73 = 45.

Another way to write it:
34 + (7 * 12) - 73 = 45
34 + 84 - 73 = 118 - 73 = 45.

Or:
(34 - 73) + (7 * 12) = -39 + 84 = 45.

The simplest form without unnecessary parentheses is usually preferred if order of operations handles it.
7 * 12 + 34 - 73 = 45.

Let's check if there's another one.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Start with the largest number, 89.
89 + 25 = 114. Then I need to use 19 to get to 95. 114 - 19 = 95.
This uses all numbers and allowed operations.
Equation: 89 + 25 - 19 = 95.
Check: 89 + 25 = 114. 114 - 19 = 95. This works.

Let's explore other possibilities to ensure this is the only or a valid solution.

Attempt 2: Try multiplication.
19 * 25 = 475. This is too large.
19 * 89 = 1691. Too large.
25 * 89 = 2225. Too large.

Attempt 3: Try division.
89 / 19 is not an integer.
89 / 25 is not an integer.
25 / 19 is not an integer.
25 / 89 is not an integer.
19 / 25 is not an integer.
19 / 89 is not an integer.
Division might be useful if it results in a smaller number that can be combined.

Let's reconsider the first successful attempt: 89 + 25 - 19 = 95.
This is a valid equation.

Let's try another order of operations with addition and subtraction.
(89 - 19) + 25 = 70 + 25 = 95. This also works.
Equation: (89 - 19) + 25 = 95.

(25 - 19) + 89 = 6 + 89 = 95. This also works.
Equation: (25 - 19) + 89 = 95.

Let's try subtraction first with the largest number.
89 - 25 = 64. Need to use 19 to get 95. 64 + 19 = 83. Not 95.
89 - 19 = 70. Need to use 25 to get 95. 70 + 25 = 95. This is the same as (89 - 19) + 25.

Let's try multiplication with one number and then add/subtract the others.
19 * ?
If we do 19 * 5, we get 95. Can we make 5 from 25 and 89?
25 / 5 = 5. But we don't have 5.

Let's try to get a number close to 95 using multiplication.
19 * 5 = 95. Can we make 5 from 25 and 89? No simple way.
25 * 4 = 100. Can we make 4 from 19 and 89? No simple way.
89 * 1 = 89. Can we make 1 from 19 and 25? No simple way.

Let's consider division again, but perhaps as the last operation.
(Something) / (Something) = 95. This seems unlikely with these numbers.

Let's go back to the successful additive/subtractive combinations.
We found:
1. 89 + 25 - 19 = 95
2. (89 - 19) + 25 = 95
3. (25 - 19) + 89 = 95

All these equations use the numbers 19, 25, and 89 exactly once and only use addition and subtraction. The problem asks for *an* equation. Any of these would be valid. I will pick the first one I found.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Set of numbers: [19, 25, 89] - Used exactly once. Yes.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - Only +, - used. Yes.
- Target value: 95 - Equation evaluates to 95. Yes.

Target: 78.

I need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 78
2. a op (b op c) = 78

Let's try combinations with 93 first.

- 93 - 76 + 61 = 78 (This looks promising!)
Let's check: 93 - 76 = 17. Then 17 + 61 = 78.
This uses all numbers (93, 76, 61) exactly once and results in 78. The operations are subtraction and addition.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, although I've found a solution.

- 93 - 76 - 61 = -44 (Incorrect)
- 93 * 76 ... (Will be very large, unlikely to get 78)
- 93 / 76 ... (Fraction, unlikely to get 78 with integer operations)

- 76 + 61 - 93 = 44 (Incorrect)
- 76 - 61 + 93 = 108 (Too high)

Let's try starting with 61.
- 61 + 93 - 76 = 78 (This is the same as 93 - 76 + 61, just reordered)
Let's check: 61 + 93 = 154. Then 154 - 76 = 78.
This also works.

- 61 - 93 + 76 = 44 (Incorrect)
- 61 + 76 - 93 = 44 (Incorrect)
- 61 - 76 + 93 = 78 (This is the same as 93 - 76 + 61, just reordered)
Let's check: 61 - 76 = -15. Then -15 + 93 = 78.
This also works.

So, I have found multiple valid equations:
1. 93 - 76 + 61 = 78
2. 61 + 93 - 76 = 78
3. 61 - 76 + 93 = 78

4011,1635,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 2, 62, and 31, exactly once each, with only the operations +, -, *, /. The target result is 93.

Let's list the numbers: [2, 62, 31].
Target: 93.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation has 4 choices. This gives 6 * 4^2 = 96 possible combinations of operations and numbers. However, the order of operations matters (parentheses).

Let's try some combinations systematically.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's consider the numbers and the target. 93 is relatively close to 62 + 31 = 93. This is a good starting point.

Attempt 1: Use addition directly.
62 + 31 = 93.
This uses 62 and 31. I still need to incorporate 2.
How can I incorporate 2 without changing the sum of 93?
I could add 0. Can I make 0 using 2 and one of the other numbers? No, not easily with just one operation.
I could multiply by 1. Can I make 1 using 2 and one of the other numbers? No.
I could add 2 and then subtract 2. But I only have one 2.

Let's try to build towards 93.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 79, 8, 27, and 47, using each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach a result of 91.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Start with the largest number, 79.
    *   79 + ? = 91. Need 12. Can we make 12 from 8, 27, 47?
        *   8 + 27 = 35. 47 - 35 = 12. So, 79 + (47 - (8 + 27)) = 79 + (47 - 35) = 79 + 12 = 91. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 79, 47, 8, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations used: +, -, +. Basic arithmetic.
Result: 91.

The equation is 79 + (47 - (8 + 27)).

Let's try another approach to be sure.

2.  Try multiplication.
    *   Maybe 8 * ?
        *   8 * 10 = 80. Need 11. Can we make 11 from 79, 27, 47? No obvious way.
        *   8 * 11 = 88. Need 3. Can we make 3 from 79, 27, 47? No obvious way.
        *   8 * 12 = 96. Need -5. Can we make -5 from 79, 27, 47? No obvious way.

3.  Try division.
    *   27 / ?
    *   47 / ?
    *   8 / ?

4.  Let's go back to the first successful attempt.
    *   79 + (47 - (8 + 27)) = 91
    *   This uses all numbers and basic operations.

Let's check if there are other possibilities.
*   (79 + 8) + (47 - 27) = 87 + 20 = 107 (Too high)
*   (79 - 8) + (47 - 27) = 71 + 20 = 91. This also works!
    *   Numbers used: 79, 8, 47, 27. All used exactly once.
    *   Operations used: -, +, -. Basic arithmetic.
    *   Result: 91.

So, (79 - 8) + (47 - 27) = 91 is another valid equation.
The user asked for ""an equation"", so either is fine. I'll provide the second one as it might be slightly simpler in structure.

Let's double check the second one:
(79 - 8) + (47 - 27)
79 - 8 = 71
47 - 27 = 20
71 + 20 = 91.

This is correct.

    *   24 * (28 - 26) = 24 * 2 = 48 (This works!)

Let's verify this:
(28 - 26) = 2
24 * 2 = 48

This uses all numbers (24, 26, 28) exactly once and only uses the allowed operators.

Let's try other starting points just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives, though the first one found is sufficient.

2.  **Start with 26:**

    *   26 * (28 - 24) = 26 * 4 = 104 (too high)
    *   26 * (24 / 28) ... (fraction)

3.  **Start with 28:**
    *   28 + 24 + 26 = 78
    *   28 * 24 ... (too large)
    *   28 + (26 - 24) = 28 + 2 = 30 (too low)
    *   28 + (24 - 26) = 28 + (-2) = 26 (too low)
    *   28 * (26 - 24) = 28 * 2 = 56 (close, but not 48)
    *   28 * (24 / 26) ... (fraction)

The combination (28 - 26) * 24 = 48 seems to be the most straightforward and correct solution.

    93 - 69 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26.
    69 - 93 + 2 = -24 + 2 = -22.

    Let's revisit 26 / 2 = 13.
    Numbers are 93, 95, 13. Target 14.
    We need to get +1 from 93 and 95.
    This is not possible with +, -, *, /.

    Let's try another division.
    93 / ?
    95 / ?

    What if we use subtraction to get a number that divides nicely?
    95 - 2 = 93.

5128,305,"<think>The user wants an equation that uses the numbers 75, 41, and 54 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to result in 20.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with 75:**
    *   (75 / ?) ... doesn't seem easy to get to 20 with 41 and 54.
    *   (75 - ?) ...
        *   75 - 41 = 34. Need to get 20 from 34 and 54. 34 - 54 = -20 (close, but wrong sign). 54 - 34 = 20. So, 54 - (75 - 41) = 54 - 34 = 20. This works!
    *   (75 + ?) ...
    *   (75 * ?) ...

2.  **Let's verify the found solution:** 54 - (75 - 41)
    *   Numbers used: 54, 75, 41 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: -, - (allowed).
    *   Calculation: 75 - 41 = 34. Then 54 - 34 = 20.

This solution meets all the criteria.

Let's try another path just to be sure or see if there are alternatives.

*   Try starting with 41:
    *   41 - 75 = -34. Need to get 20 from -34 and 54. -34 + 54 = 20. So, (41 - 75) + 54 = -34 + 54 = 20. This also works!
    *   Numbers used: 41, 75, 54 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: -, + (allowed).
    *   Calculation: 41 - 75 = -34. Then -34 + 54 = 20.
    *   Result: 20.

Both 54 - (75 - 41) and (41 - 75) + 54 are valid. I'll pick one. The first one seems slightly more straightforward in terms of intermediate positive numbers.

Let's re-check the first one: 54 - (75 - 41)
Numbers: 75, 41, 54 (used once)
Operations: -, - (allowed)
Result: 54 - (34) = 20. Correct.

Let's re-check the second one: (41 - 75) + 54
Numbers: 41, 75, 54 (used once)
Operations: -, + (allowed)
Result: (-34) + 54 = 20. Correct.

I will provide the first one.

The user wants me to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers [36, 70, 90, 42] exactly once to reach the target value 85. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: 36, 70, 90, 42.
Target: 85.

I need to combine these four numbers.
Possible approaches:
1. Try to get close to 85 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.
2. Try combinations of operations.

Let's look at the numbers and the target. 85 is not a multiple of any of the numbers.
The numbers are relatively large.

Let's try some combinations:
- 90 is close to 85. Maybe 90 - something?
  - 90 - 5 = 85. Can I make 5 from 36, 70, 42?
    - 70 / (36/?) - doesn't seem easy.
    - (70 - 42) / ? = 28 / ? - not 5.
    - (42 - 36) / ? = 6 / ? - not 5.
    - 70 - 36 - 42 = 34 - 42 = -8.
    - 70 + 36 + 42 = 148.
    - 70 * 36 * 42 - too big.
    - 70 / 36 - not integer.
    - 70 / 42 - not integer.
    - 36 / 42 - not integer.
    - 42 / 36 - not integer.

- What if I use multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract?
  - 36 * 2 = 72 (not using 2)
  - 36 * 3 = 108 (not using 3)
  - 42 * 2 = 84 (close!)
    - If I use 42 * 2, I need to make 2 from 36, 70, 90. This is not possible as I can only use each number once.

Let's try combining pairs first.
- 36 + 70 = 106
- 36 + 90 = 126
- 36 + 42 = 78
- 70 + 90 = 160
- 70 + 42 = 112
- 90 + 42 = 132

- 70 - 36 = 34
- 90 - 36 = 54
- 42 - 36 = 6
- 90 - 70 = 20
- 70 - 42 = 28
- 90 - 42 = 48

- 36 * 70 = 2520 (too big)
- 36 * 90 = 3240 (too big)
- 36 * 42 = 1512 (too big)
- 70 * 90 = 6300 (too big)
- 70 * 42 = 2940 (too big)
- 90 * 42 = 3780 (too big)

- 70 / 36 (not integer)
- 90 / 36 = 2.5
- 42 / 36 (not integer)
- 90 / 70 (not integer)
- 42 / 70 (not integer)
- 42 / 90 (not integer)

Let's try combining three numbers first.
- (90 + 42) - 36 = 132 - 36 = 96. Need to adjust with 70. 96 - 70 = 26. 96 + 70 = 166.
- (90 - 42) + 36 = 48 + 36 = 84. Need to adjust with 70. 84 - 70 = 14. 84 + 70 = 154.
- (90 - 36) + 42 = 54 + 42 = 96. Need to adjust with 70. 96 - 70 = 26. 96 + 70 = 166.
- (70 + 42) - 36 = 112 - 36 = 76. Need to adjust with 90. 76 + 90 = 166. 76 - 90 = -14.
- (70 - 42) + 36 = 28 + 36 = 64. Need to adjust with 90. 64 + 90 = 154. 64 - 90 = -26.
- (70 + 36) - 42 = 106 - 42 = 64. Need to adjust with 90. 64 + 90 = 154. 64 - 90 = -26.

Let's try division more strategically.
Maybe a division results in a small integer that can be used.
- 90 / ?
- 70 / ?
- 42 / ?
- 36 / ?

Consider 90 / (something).
If I can make 90 / X = Y, and then use the remaining numbers to get 85.

Let's try to get a number close to 85 by adding/subtracting.
- 70 + 42 = 112. 112 - 36 = 76. 76 + 90 = 166. 76 - 90 = -14.
- 90 + 36 = 126. 126 - 42 = 84. Close! Need to use 70.
  - (90 + 36) - 42 = 84. Now use 70.
    - 84 + 70 = 154.
    - 84 - 70 = 14.
    - 70 - 84 = -14.
    - 84 * 70 (too big)
    - 84 / 70 (not integer)
    - 70 / 84 (not integer)

Let's try another combination that gets close to 85.
- 90 - 42 = 48.
- 70 - 36 = 34.
- 48 + 34 = 82. Close!
  - So, (90 - 42) + (70 - 36) = 48 + 34 = 82.
  - This uses all numbers: 90, 42, 70, 36.
  - The result is 82. The target is 85. I need to add 3.
  - This combination doesn't work directly.

Let's rethink the structure.
Maybe something like (A + B) * C / D or A * B + C - D.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 85 and subtract.
- 90 + 70 = 160.
- 42 + 36 = 78.
- 160 - 78 = 82. (Same as above)

What if division is used to reduce a number?
- 70 / ?
- 42 / ?
- 36 / ?
- 90 / ?

Consider 42 / 36. Not integer.
Consider 70 / 36. Not integer.
Consider 90 / 36 = 2.5. Not integer.
Consider 42 / 70. Not integer.

Consider 90 / 70. Not integer.
Consider 36 / 42. Not integer.

The problem asks us to find an equation that evaluates to 53 using the numbers 43, 96, 80, and 80 exactly once, with the allowed operations being addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The target number is 53. The available numbers are 43, 96, 80, 80.

Let's list the numbers: N = {43, 96, 80, 80}.
The target is T = 53.

We need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. The order of operations matters, so we'll consider parentheses.

Let's try to get close to 53.
The numbers are roughly in the range of 40-100.
53 is a relatively small number compared to the products we can get from these numbers. This suggests that division or subtraction will likely be important.

Let's consider combinations of two numbers first, then incorporate the others.

Possible pairs and their operations:
43 + 96 = 139
43 - 96 = -53
96 - 43 = 53  <-- This is interesting! If we can make the remaining two 80s cancel out or become 0, we might have a solution.
43 * 96 = 4128
96 / 43 (not an integer)

43 + 80 = 123
43 - 80 = -37
80 - 43 = 37
43 * 80 = 3440
80 / 43 (not an integer)

96 + 80 = 176
96 - 80 = 16
80 - 96 = -16
96 * 80 = 7680
96 / 80 = 1.2

80 + 80 = 160
80 - 80 = 0  <-- This is very useful!
80 * 80 = 6400
80 / 80 = 1

Let's focus on the 96 - 43 = 53.
We have used 96 and 43. The remaining numbers are 80 and 80.
We need to combine 80 and 80 in such a way that when combined with 53, the result is 53.
This means the combination of 80 and 80 must evaluate to 0, and we should add it to 53.
(96 - 43) + (80 - 80) = 53 + 0 = 53.
This uses all numbers (43, 96, 80, 80) exactly once.
The operations used are subtraction and addition.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's verify:
Numbers: 43, 96, 80, 80.
Target: 53.
Equation: (96 - 43) + (80 - 80)
Step 1: 96 - 43 = 53
Step 2: 80 - 80 = 0
Step 3: 53 + 0 = 53.
This works.

Let's explore other possibilities to be thorough.

What if we start with the two 80s?
80 - 80 = 0. We need to get 53 from 43 and 96.
We can't get 53 from 43 and 96 using only one operation.
If we have 0, we need to combine it with the result of (43 op 96).
(43 op 96) op 0 = 53.
If op is +, then (43 op 96) + 0 = 53, so 43 op 96 = 53. We already saw 96 - 43 = 53.
So, (96 - 43) + (80 - 80) = 53. This is the same solution.

If op is -, then (43 op 96) - 0 = 53, so 43 op 96 = 53. Again, 96 - 43 = 53.
So, (96 - 43) - (80 - 80) = 53. This is also a valid solution.

If op is *, then (43 op 96) * 0 = 0, not 53.

If op is /, then (43 op 96) / 0 is undefined.

What if we use 80 / 80 = 1?
We have 1, 43, 96. We need to get 53.
Possible combinations:
(43 op 96) op 1 = 53
(43 op 1) op 96 = 53
(96 op 1) op 43 = 53

Case 1: (43 op 96) op 1 = 53
If op is +, then (43 op 96) + 1 = 53, so 43 op 96 = 52.
43 + 96 = 139
96 - 43 = 53
43 - 96 = -53
43 * 96 = 4128
96 / 43 (not integer)
None of these give 52.

If op is -, then (43 op 96) - 1 = 53, so 43 op 96 = 54.
None of these give 54.

If op is *, then (43 op 96) * 1 = 53, so 43 op 96 = 53.
We know 96 - 43 = 53.
So, (96 - 43) * (80 / 80) = 53 * 1 = 53.
This is another valid solution: (96 - 43) * (80 / 80).

Let's check this one:
Numbers: 43, 96, 80, 80.
Target: 53.
Equation: (96 - 43) * (80 / 80)
Step 1: 96 - 43 = 53
Step 2: 80 / 80 = 1
Step 3: 53 * 1 = 53.
This also works.

Case 2: (43 op 1) op 96 = 53
43 + 1 = 44. Then 44 op 96 = 53.
44 + 96 = 140
96 - 44 = 52
44 - 96 = -52
44 * 96 = 4224
96 / 44 (not integer)
None give 53.

43 - 1 = 42. Then 42 op 96 = 53.
42 + 96 = 138
96 - 42 = 54
42 - 96 = -54
42 * 96 = 4032
96 / 42 (not integer)
None give 53.

43 * 1 = 43. Then 43 op 96 = 53.
43 + 96 = 139
96 - 43 = 53. So, (43 * 1) + (96 - 43) is not using numbers correctly. We have used 43 twice.
We need to combine 43, 1, and 96.
(43 * 1) + 96 = 43 + 96 = 139
(43 * 1) - 96 = 43 - 96 = -53
96 - (43 * 1) = 96 - 43 = 53.
So, 96 - (43 * (80 / 80)) = 96 - (43 * 1) = 96 - 43 = 53.
This is another valid solution: 96 - (43 * (80 / 80)).

The target number is 72.

Strategy 1: Try to get close to 72 with a few numbers and then adjust with the remaining ones.

If I multiply 76 by something, it will likely exceed 72 quickly unless I divide.

   - odd / even = not integer (usually)
   - even / odd = not integer (usually)
   - even * even = even
   - even + even = even
   - even - even = even
   - even / even = even or odd

This parity analysis suggests that to get an odd number (81), I'll likely need an odd number of odd numbers in additions/subtractions, or a multiplication involving an odd number. Since I only have one odd number (45), it's likely to be involved in a way that preserves its oddness or converts an even result to odd.

Let's try combining pairs first:
- 45 + 2 = 47
- 45 - 2 = 43
- 45 * 2 = 90
- 45 / 2 = 22.5 (not useful)

- 45 + 32 = 77
- 45 - 32 = 13
- 45 * 32 = 1440
- 45 / 32 (not useful)

- 45 + 92 = 137
- 45 - 92 = -47
- 45 * 92 = 4140
- 45 / 92 (not useful)

- 2 + 32 = 34
- 2 - 32 = -30
- 2 * 32 = 64
- 32 / 2 = 16

- 2 + 92 = 94
- 2 - 92 = -90
- 2 * 92 = 184
- 92 / 2 = 46

- 32 + 92 = 124
- 32 - 92 = -60
- 32 * 92 = 2944
- 92 / 32 (not useful)

Let's try to get close to 81.
92 is the largest.
92 - ? = 81 => ? = 11. Can I make 11 from [45, 2, 32]?
   - 45 - 32 - 2 = 11. This looks promising!
   - So, 92 - (45 - 32 - 2) = 92 - (13 - 2) = 92 - 11 = 81.
   - Let's check the numbers used: 92, 45, 32, 2. All used once.
   - Operations: -, -, -. All basic.
   - This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's try another path to confirm.
What if I multiply?
Maybe 32 * 2 = 64.
Remaining numbers: [45, 92]. Target: 81.
Can I get 81 from 64 and [45, 92]?
   - 64 + 45 = 109. Need to subtract 28. Can't make 28 from 92.
   - 64 + 92 = 156. Need to subtract 75. Can't make 75 from 45.
   - 64 - 45 = 19. Need to add 62. Can't make 62 from 92.
   - 64 - 92 = -28. Need to add 109. Can't make 109 from 45.
   - 45 - 64 = -19. Need to add 100. Can't make 100 from 92.
   - 92 - 64 = 28. Need to add 53. Can't make 53 from 45.

What about 45 * 2 = 90?
Remaining numbers: [32, 92]. Target: 81.
   - 90 + 32 = 122. Need to subtract 41. Can't make 41 from 92.
   - 90 - 32 = 58. Need to add 23. Can't make 23 from 92.
   - 90 + 92 = 182. Need to subtract 101. Can't make 101 from 32.
   - 90 - 92 = -2. Need to add 83. Can't make 83 from 32.
   - 32 - 90 = -58. Need to add 139. Can't make 139 from 92.
   - 92 - 90 = 2. Need to add 79. Can't make 79 from 32.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution: 92 - (45 - 32 - 2) = 81.
This is 92 - (13 - 2) = 92 - 11 = 81.
The order of operations is important.
If I write it as 92 - 45 - 32 - 2, it would be 47 - 32 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13. Incorrect.
So parentheses are needed.
The expression is 92 - (45 - 32 - 2).
This uses 92, 45, 32, 2. All once.
Operations are -, -, -. All basic.
Result is 81.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 81 or (A + B) * C - D = 81.

Consider 32 / 2 = 16. Numbers left: [45, 92]. Target: 81.
   - 16 + 45 = 61. Need to add 20. Can't make 20 from 92.
   - 16 + 92 = 108. Need to subtract 27. Can't make 27 from 45.
   - 45 - 16 = 29. Need to add 52. Can't make 52 from 92.
   - 92 - 16 = 76. Need to add 5. Can't make 5 from 45.

Consider 92 / 2 = 46. Numbers left: [45, 32]. Target: 81.
   - 46 + 45 = 91. Need to subtract 10. Can't make 10 from 32.
   - 46 + 32 = 78. Need to add 3. Can't make 3 from 45.
   - 45 - 46 = -1. Need to add 82. Can't make 82 from 32.
   - 46 - 45 = 1. Need to add 80. Can't make 80 from 32.
   - 45 - 32 = 13. Need to add 68. Can't make 68 from 46.
   - 32 - 45 = -13. Need to add 94. Can't make 94 from 46.

Let's go back to the first solution: 92 - (45 - 32 - 2) = 81.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to find another one just in case.
What if 45 is involved in multiplication?
45 *",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
5686,1776,"<think
The user wants me to create an equation that evaluates to 100 using the numbers [95, 12, 96, 47] exactly once, and only using the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's list the numbers: 95, 12, 96, 47.
Target: 100.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations. I can try different groupings and orders.

Strategy 1: Start with the largest numbers and see if I can get close to 100.
- 96 + 47 = 143. Too high.
- 96 - 47 = 49. Need to get 100 from 95 and 12 and 49. (95 + 12) + 49 = 107 + 49 = 156. (95 - 12) + 49 = 83 + 49 = 132. (95 * 12) + 49 = 1140 + 49 = 1189. (95 / 12) is not an integer.
- 95 + 47 = 142. Need to get 100 from 96 and 12 and 142. (96 + 12) + 142 = 108 + 142 = 250. (96 - 12) + 142 = 84 + 142 = 226. (96 * 12) + 142 = 1152 + 142 = 1294. (96 / 12) = 8. So, 8 + 142 = 150. Not 100.
- 95 - 47 = 48. Need to get 100 from 96 and 12 and 48. (96 + 12) + 48 = 108 + 48 = 156. (96 - 12) + 48 = 84 + 48 = 132. (96 * 12) + 48 = 1152 + 48 = 1200. (96 / 12) = 8. So, 8 + 48 = 56. Not 100.

Strategy 2: Look for combinations that might result in numbers that are easy to work with, like multiples of 10 or numbers close to 100.
- 96 / 12 = 8. Now I have [95, 47, 8]. Target 100.
  - 95 + 47 + 8 = 150.
  - 95 - 47 + 8 = 48 + 8 = 56.
  - 95 + 47 - 8 = 142 - 8 = 134.
  - 95 - (47 - 8) = 95 - 39 = 56.
  - 95 + (47 - 8) = 95 + 39 = 134.
  - 95 * 8 = 760. Then 760 + 47 or 760 - 47. Too big.
  - 47 * 8 = 376. Then 376 + 95 or 376 - 95. Too big.
  - (95 + 47) * 8 = 142 * 8. Too big.
  - (95 - 47) * 8 = 48 * 8 = 384. Too big.

Let's try another division.
- 96 / 47 is not an integer.
- 95 / 12 is not an integer.
- 95 / 47 is not an integer.
- 47 / 12 is not an integer.
- 12 / 96 is a fraction.
- 12 / 47 is a fraction.
- 47 / 96 is a fraction.
- 47 / 95 is a fraction.

It seems division might be used to simplify numbers or create smaller integers. The 96/12 = 8 was promising.

Let's reconsider the numbers: 95, 12, 96, 47. Target: 100.

What if I try to make a number close to 100 using two numbers, and then adjust with the other two?
- 95 + 12 = 107. Need to get -7 from 96 and 47. 47 - 96 = -49. 96 - 47 = 49. No.
- 95 - 12 = 83. Need to get 17 from 96 and 47. 96 - 47 = 49. 47 - 96 = -49. No.
- 96 + 4 = 100. Can I make 4 from 95, 12, 47?
  - 47 - (95 - 12) = 47 - 83 = -36.
  - (95 - 12) - 47 = 83 - 47 = 36.
  - 95 - (47 + 12) = 95 - 59 = 36.
  - (95 + 12) - 47 = 107 - 47 = 60.
  - 95 / ? No.
  - 12 / ? No.
  - 47 / ? No.

Let's try to make 100 directly.
Maybe a multiplication is involved that gets us close.
- 12 * 8 = 96. We have 95, 47, 96. Target 100.
  - (96 / 12) = 8. Numbers are 95, 47, 8. Target 100.
    - 95 + 47 - 8 = 134.
    - 95 - 47 + 8 = 56.
    - 95 + 8 - 47 = 56.
    - 47 + 8 + 95 = 150.
    - 95 + (47 - 8) = 95 + 39 = 134.
    - 95 - (47 - 8) = 95 - 39 = 56.
    - 47 + (95 - 8) = 47 + 87 = 134.
    - 47 - (95 - 8) = 47 - 87 = -40.
    - 8 + (95 - 47) = 8 + 48 = 56.
    - 8 - (95 - 47) = 8 - 48 = -40.

Let's try another approach. What if we subtract from a larger number?
- 96 + 47 = 143. Need to subtract 43. Can I make 43 from 95 and 12?
  - 95 - 12 = 83. No.
  - 95 + 12 = 107. No.
  - 95 / 12. No.
  - 12 / 95. No.

What if we use multiplication to get a number slightly larger than 100 and then subtract?
- 12 * 9 = 108. Can I make 9 from 95, 47, 96? No.
- 12 * 10 = 120. Can I make 10 from 95, 47, 96? No.

Let's try combining two numbers to get something that, when combined with the other two, reaches 100.
Consider (A op B) op C op D = 100.

Try to make a number that, when added to another, gives 100.
- 95 + 5 = 100. Can I make 5 from 12, 96, 47?
  - 47 - (96 / 12) = 47 - 8 = 39. No.

4739,1343,"<think>The target is 77. The numbers are 78, 42, 84, 42.
I need to combine these four numbers using +, -, *, / to get 77.

Let's try to get close to 77 first.
78 is close to 77. Maybe I can subtract 1 from 78.
How can I get 1 from 42, 84, 42?
84 / 42 = 2.
Then I have 2 and 42.
Can I get 1 from 2 and 42?
42 / 2 = 21 (no)
42 - 2 = 40 (no)
2 - 42 = -40 (no)
2 * 42 = 84 (no)

Let's try another approach.
Maybe I can get a number slightly larger than 77 and subtract something.
Or a number slightly smaller than 77 and add something.

Let's look at the numbers again: 78, 42, 84, 42.
Notice that 84 is 2 * 42.
So, 84 / 42 = 2.
This leaves me with 78, 42, and 2.
I need to combine 78, 42, 2 to get 77.

Let's try combining 78 and 42 first.
78 + 42 = 120
78 - 42 = 36
42 - 78 = -36
78 * 42 = large
78 / 42 = not integer

Let's try combining 42 and 2 first.
42 + 2 = 44
42 - 2 = 40
2 - 42 = -40
42 * 2 = 84
42 / 2 = 21

If I have 21 from 42/2, I have 78 and 42 left.
Can I combine 78, 42, 21 to get 77?
78 + 42 + 21 = 141
78 - 42 + 21 = 36 + 21 = 57
78 + 42 - 21 = 120 - 21 = 99
78 - 42 - 21 = 36 - 21 = 15
78 + 21 - 42 = 99 - 42 = 57
78 - 21 + 42 = 57 + 42 = 99
42 + 21 - 78 = 63 - 78 = -15
42 - 21 + 78 = 21 + 78 = 99
21 + 42 - 78 = 63 - 78 = -15
21 - 42 + 78 = -21 + 78 = 57

Let's go back to 84 / 42 = 2.
Numbers left: 78, 42, 2. Target: 77.
Try combining 78 and 2.
78 + 2 = 80
78 - 2 = 76
2 - 78 = -76
78 * 2 = 156
78 / 2 = 39

If I have 76 from 78-2, I have 42 left.
Can I combine 76 and 42 to get 77?
76 + 42 = 118
76 - 42 = 34
42 - 76 = -34
76 * 42 = large
76 / 42 = not integer

If I have 39 from 78/2, I have 42 left.
Can I combine 39 and 42 to get 77?
39 + 42 = 81 (close!)
42 - 39 = 3
39 - 42 = -3
39 * 42 = large
39 / 42 = not integer

So, (78 / 2) + 42 = 39 + 42 = 81. This is not 77.

Let's reconsider the 84 / 42 = 2 step.
The numbers are 78, 42, 84, 42.
Let's try using the two 42s together.
42 + 42 = 84. Numbers left: 78, 84. Target: 77.

78 - 84 = -6
84 - 78 = 6
78 * 84 = large
78 / 84 = not integer
84 / 78 = not integer

Let's try combining 78 with one of the 42s.
78 + 42 = 120. Numbers left: 84, 42. Target: 77.
120 + 84 + 42 = large
120 - 84 + 42 = 36 + 42 = 78 (close!)
120 + 84 - 42 = 204 - 42 = 162
120 - 84 - 42 = 36 - 42 = -6
120 + 42 - 84 = 162 - 84 = 78 (close!)
120 - 42 + 84 = 78 + 84 = 162

Let's try 120 - 84 + 42 = 78. This is not 77.
Let's try 120 + 42 - 84 = 78. This is not 77.

What if I use subtraction to get 77?
Maybe something like X - Y = 77.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 77.
78 is already there.
Can I get 1 from 42, 84, 42?
84 / 42 = 2. Left with 42, 2.
42 / 2 = 21.
42 - 2 = 40.
2 - 42 = -40.
2 * 42 = 84.

Let's try to get a number slightly smaller than 77.
Maybe 76?
78 - 2 = 76. How to get 2 from 42, 84, 42?
84 / 42 = 2. This uses 84 and one 42.
So, 78 - (84 / 42) = 78 - 2 = 76.
Numbers used: 78, 84, 42. Number left: 42.

The available numbers are [49, 37, 1].
I need to use each number exactly once with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with multiplication:**
    *   49 * 37 = 1813 (Too large, unlikely to get to 86 by subtracting 1)
    *   49 * 1 = 49. Then I need to get 86 from 49 and 37. 86 - 49 = 37. So, 49 * 1 + 37 = 86. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 49, 1, 37. All used exactly once.
Operations used: multiplication, addition. Allowed.
Result: 49 * 1 + 37 = 49 + 37 = 86. Correct.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, though the first one is a valid solution.

    *   1 - 37 = -36. Then I need to get 86 from -36 and 49.
        *   -36 + 49 = 13 (No)
        *   49 - (-36) = 85 (No)

4.  **Start with division:**
    *   49 / 37 (Not an integer)
    *   37 / 49 (Not an integer)
    *   49 / 1 = 49. Then I need to get 86 from 49 and 37. 86 - 49 = 37. So, 49 / 1 + 37 = 86. This is the same as 49 * 1 + 37.
    *   1 / 49 (Not an integer)
    *   37 / 1 = 37. Then I need to get 86 from 37 and 49. 86 - 37 = 49. So, 37 / 1 + 49 = 86. This is the same as 37 + 49.
    *   1 / 37 (Not an integer)

The two valid solutions found are:
1.  49 * 1 + 37 = 86
2.  (49 + 37) * 1 = 86

I will present the first one as it's slightly more direct.

5380,991,"<think>Numbers: [42, 91, 94]. Target: 45.
I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations:
1. Start with 94:
   - 94 - 42 = 52. Now I need to use 91 to get 45 from 52. 52 - 91 is negative, 52 + 91 is too big, 52 * 91 is too big, 52 / 91 is a fraction. This path doesn't seem promising.
   - 94 - 91 = 3. Now I need to use 42 to get 45 from 3. 3 + 42 = 45. This looks like a solution.
   Let's verify: (94 - 91) + 42 = 3 + 42 = 45.
   This uses all numbers [42, 91, 94] exactly once and results in 45.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

2. Start with 91:
   - 91 - 42 = 49. Need to use 94 to get 45. 49 - 94 is negative, 49 + 94 is too big, 49 * 94 is too big, 49 / 94 is a fraction.
   - 91 - 94 is negative.
   - 91 + 42 = 133. Need to use 94. 133 - 94 = 39 (not 45). 133 + 94 is too big.
   - 91 * 42 is too big.
   - 91 / 42 is a fraction.

3. Start with 42:
   - 42 + 91 = 133. Need to use 94. 133 - 94 = 39 (not 45).
   - 42 + 94 = 136. Need to use 91. 136 - 91 = 45. This is another solution.
   Let's verify: (42 + 94) - 91 = 136 - 91 = 45.
   This also uses all numbers [42, 91, 94] exactly once and results in 45.

   - 42 - 91 is negative.
   - 42 - 94 is negative.
   - 42 * 91 is too big.
   - 42 / 91 is a fraction.

We have found two valid equations:
1. (94 - 91) + 42 = 45
2. (42 + 94) - 91 = 45

The user wants an equation using the numbers 65, 8, 63, and 62 to reach the target number 73.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining the numbers.

Numbers: [65, 8, 63, 62]

Possible combinations:
- Start with the largest number, 65.

      - So, 65 + ((63 - 62) * 8) = 65 + (1 * 8) = 65 + 8 = 73.
      - This uses 65, 63, 62, and 8. All numbers are used once.
      - The equation is 65 + ((63 - 62) * 8) = 73.

The user wants a mathematical equation that results in 34.
I must use the numbers [61, 26, 21, 20] exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: 61, 26, 21, 20.
Target: 34.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations to get 34.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite spread out. 61 is the largest, 20 is the smallest.

Maybe start with the largest number and subtract others?
61 - 26 = 35. Close!
Now I have 21 and 20 left. I need to get -1 from 21 and 20 to add to 35 to get 34.
Can I get -1 from 21 and 20?
21 - 20 = 1. Not -1.
20 - 21 = -1. Yes!
So, (61 - 26) + (20 - 21) = 35 + (-1) = 34.
This uses all numbers (61, 26, 20, 21) exactly once.
It uses allowed operations (+, -, -).

Let's check the constraints:
- Numbers used: 61, 26, 21, 20. All used exactly once. (Yes)
- Target value: 34. (Yes)
- Allowed operations: +, -, *. (Yes)

The equation is (61 - 26) + (20 - 21) = 34.

Let's try another approach to be sure.
Maybe multiplication is involved?
20 * 2 = 40. Not helpful.
20 * 1 = 20.
21 * 1 = 21.
26 * 1 = 26.
61 * 1 = 61.

What if I try to make a number close to 34 using two numbers and then adjust with the other two?
20 + 21 = 41. Left with 61, 26. Need to get -7 from 61 and 26.
61 - 26 = 35. Not -7.
26 - 61 = -35. Not -7.
61 / 26 is not an integer.
26 / 61 is not an integer.
61 * 26 is too large.

20 + 26 = 46. Left with 61, 21. Need to get -12 from 61 and 21.
61 - 21 = 40. Not -12.
21 - 61 = -40. Not -12.

20 + 61 = 81. Left with 26, 21. Need to get -47 from 26 and 21.
26 - 21 = 5. Not -47.
21 - 26 = -5. Not -47.

21 + 26 = 47. Left with 61, 20. Need to get -13 from 61 and 20.
61 - 20 = 41. Not -13.
20 - 61 = -41. Not -13.

21 + 61 = 82. Left with 26, 20. Need to get -48 from 26 and 20.
26 - 20 = 6. Not -48.
20 - 26 = -6. Not -48.

26 + 61 = 87. Left with 21, 20. Need to get -53 from 21 and 20.
21 - 20 = 1. Not -53.
20 - 21 = -1. Not -53.

Let's try subtraction first.
61 - 20 = 41. Left with 26, 21. Need to get -7 from 26 and 21.
26 - 21 = 5. Not -7.
21 - 26 = -5. Not -7.

61 - 21 = 40. Left with 26, 20. Need to get -6 from 26 and 20.
26 - 20 = 6. Not -6.
20 - 26 = -6. Yes!
So, (61 - 21) + (20 - 26) = 40 + (-6) = 34.
This also works! Uses 61, 21, 20, 26 exactly once. Uses +, -, -.

Let's check this second solution: (61 - 21) + (20 - 26) = 34.
- Numbers used: 61, 21, 20, 26. All used exactly once. (Yes)
- Target value: 34. (Yes)
- Allowed operations: +, -, *. (Yes)

Both (61 - 26) + (20 - 21) and (61 - 21) + (20 - 26) are valid.
The first one I found was (61 - 26) + (20 - 21). I will stick with that one.

Let's consider multiplication again.
Maybe a division is involved?
61 / 20 - not integer.
61 / 21 - not integer.
61 / 26 - not integer.
26 / 20 - not integer.
26 / 21 - not integer.
21 / 20 - not integer.

What if we multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the others?
20 * 21 = 420. Too big.
20 * 26 = 520. Too big.
20 * 61 = 1220. Too big.
21 * 26 = 546. Too big.
21 * 61 = 1281. Too big.
26 * 61 = 1586. Too big.

What if we divide two numbers first?
This seems unlikely as none of the divisions result in integers.
For example, (20/21) * 61 + 26. This would involve fractions. The problem doesn't explicitly forbid fractions in intermediate steps, but usually, these puzzles imply integer arithmetic unless specified. However, the operations are +, -, *, /. If division results in a non-integer, it's still a valid operation.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution: (61 - 26) + (20 - 21) = 34.
This is clean and uses only subtraction and addition.

Let's try to use multiplication.
Maybe something like (A * B) - C + D?
Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 34 and subtract.
20 * 2 = 40. Not helpful.
20 * 1 = 20.
21 * 1 = 21.
26 * 1 = 26.
61 * 1 = 61.

What if we try to make a number close to 34 using multiplication and then adjust?
Let's try to get a number around 30-40.
20 * ?
21 * ?
26 * ?

Consider the numbers again: 61, 26, 21, 20. Target: 34.

Let's try to make 34 directly.
Maybe 20 + 14? Can I make 14 from 61, 26, 21?
61 - 26 - 21 = 35 - 21 = 14.
So, 20 + (61 - 26 - 21) = 20 + 14 = 34.
This uses 20, 61, 26, 21 exactly once.
Operations: +, -, -.
This is also a valid solution.
Equation: 20 + (61 - 26 - 21) = 34.

Let's check this third solution: 20 + (61 - 26 - 21) = 34.
- Numbers used: 20, 61, 26, 21. All used exactly once. (Yes)
- Target value: 34. (Yes)
- Allowed operations: +, -, *. (Yes)

Let's list the numbers: [49, 74, 53]
Target: 78

I need to try different combinations of operations and number orders.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's start by trying to combine two numbers and then use the third.

Attempt 1: Addition first
49 + 74 = 123. Now I need to use 53 to get 78.
123 - 53 = 70. Not 78.
123 + 53 = 176. Not 78.
123 * 53 = too large.
123 / 53 = not an integer.

49 + 53 = 102. Now use 74.
102 - 74 = 28. Not 78.
102 + 74 = 176. Not 78.
102 * 74 = too large.
102 / 74 = not an integer.

74 + 53 = 127. Now use 49.
127 - 49 = 78. This works!

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 74, 53, 49. All used exactly once.
Operations used: +, -. Basic arithmetic operations.
Result: 78. Target reached.

The equation is (74 + 53) - 49 = 78.

Let's try other combinations to be thorough, although I've found a solution.

Attempt 2: Subtraction first
74 - 49 = 25. Now use 53.
25 + 53 = 78. This also works!
Equation: (74 - 49) + 53 = 78.
Numbers used: 74, 49, 53. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +. Basic arithmetic operations.
Result: 78. Target reached.

49 - 74 = -25. Now use 53.
-25 + 53 = 28. Not 78.
-25 - 53 = -78. Not 78.

74 - 53 = 21. Now use 49.
21 + 49 = 70. Not 78.
21 - 49 = -28. Not 78.

53 - 49 = 4. Now use 74.
4 + 74 = 78. This also works!
Equation: (53 - 49) + 74 = 78.
Numbers used: 53, 49, 74. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +. Basic arithmetic operations.
Result: 78. Target reached.

53 - 74 = -21. Now use 49.
-21 + 49 = 28. Not 78.
-21 - 49 = -70. Not 78.

Attempt 3: Multiplication first
49 * 74 = too large.
49 * 53 = too large.
74 * 53 = too large.

Attempt 4: Division first
49 / 74 = not integer.
74 / 49 = not integer.
49 / 53 = not integer.
53 / 49 = not integer.
74 / 53 = not integer.
53 / 74 = not integer.

It seems multiplication and division are unlikely to be the first operation unless they lead to a number that can be combined with the third number.

Let's re-examine the successful ones:
1. (74 + 53) - 49 = 127 - 49 = 78
2. (74 - 49) + 53 = 25 + 53 = 78
3. (53 - 49) + 74 = 4 + 74 = 78

All three are valid. I can present any one of them. I will choose the first one I found.

Let's double check the rules:
- Combine [49 74 53]
- Use only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Every number must be used exactly once.
- Target value is 78.

Equation: (74 + 53) - 49 = 78
Numbers used: 74, 53, 49 (all used once)
Operations: +, - (basic)
Result: 78 (target)

This is a valid solution.
I will present (74 + 53) - 49 = 78.
Another valid option is (74 - 49) + 53 = 78.
And (53 - 49) + 74 = 78.

661,562,"<think>The problem requires me to find an equation using the numbers 6, 4, and 27, each exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, and /, that results in 25.

I need to explore various combinations of these numbers and operations. Let's list the numbers: 6, 4, 27. The target is 25.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op b) op c = 25
2. a op (b op c) = 25

Let's try combinations systematically.

**Attempt 1: Using multiplication first**

*   Try 6 * 4 = 24. Then I need to get 25 from 24 and 27.
    *   24 + 27 = 51 (Too high)
    *   24 - 27 = -3 (Too low)
    *   27 - 24 = 3 (Too low)
    *   24 / 27 (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 25 easily)
    *   27 / 24 (Not an integer)
    *   So, (6 * 4) op 27 doesn't seem to work.

*   Try 6 * 27. This will be a large number (162).
    *   162 + 4 = 166
    *   162 - 4 = 158
    *   4 - 162 = -158
    *   162 / 4 (Not an integer)
    *   4 / 162 (Not an integer)
    *   So, (6 * 27) op 4 doesn't seem to work.

*   Try 4 * 27 = 108.
    *   108 + 6 = 114
    *   108 - 6 = 102
    *   6 - 108 = -102
    *   108 / 6 = 18. Now I have 18 and need to get 25. This doesn't use all numbers. The structure is (4 * 27) / 6. This uses all numbers. (4 * 27) / 6 = 108 / 6 = 18. Not 25.
    *   6 / 108 (Not an integer)
    *   So, (4 * 27) op 6 doesn't seem to work.

**Attempt 2: Using division first**

*   Try 27 / 6. Not an integer.

*   Try 4 / 6. Not an integer.
*   Try 6 / 27. Not an integer.
*   Try 4 / 27. Not an integer.

This suggests that if division is used, it might be at the end, or it might be part of a larger expression that results in an integer. Or, perhaps division is not the primary operation.

**Attempt 3: Using addition/subtraction first**

*   Try 27 + 6 = 33. Then use 4.
    *   33 + 4 = 37
    *   33 - 4 = 29
    *   4 - 33 = -29
    *   33 * 4 = 132
    *   33 / 4 (Not integer)
    *   4 / 33 (Not integer)
    *   So, (27 + 6) op 4 doesn't work.

*   Try 27 - 6 = 21. Then use 4.
    *   21 + 4 = 25. **This looks promising!**
    *   Let's check the equation: (27 - 6) + 4 = 21 + 4 = 25.
    *   This uses 27, 6, and 4 exactly once.
    *   It uses subtraction and addition.
    *   The result is 25.

Let's verify this is a valid solution.
Numbers used: 27, 6, 4 (all used once).
Operations used: -, + (fundamental arithmetic operations).
Result: 25.

This seems to be the correct solution. I should also consider other arrangements to be thorough, but this one fits all criteria.

Let's quickly check other combinations with 27 and 6:
*   6 - 27 = -21. Then use 4.
    *   -21 + 4 = -17
    *   -21 - 4 = -25
    *   4 - (-21) = 25. **This is another potential solution!**
    *   Equation: 4 - (6 - 27) = 4 - (-21) = 4 + 21 = 25.
    *   Numbers used: 4, 6, 27 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: -, - (fundamental arithmetic operations).
    *   Result: 25.

Both (27 - 6) + 4 and 4 - (6 - 27) work. The problem asks for *an* equation. I'll present the first one I found as it's slightly simpler in terms of parenthesis.

Let's consider the structure a op (b op c) = 25.
*   27 + (6 - 4) = 27 + 2 = 29
*   27 - (6 - 4) = 27 - 2 = 25. **Another solution!**
    *   Equation: 27 - (6 - 4) = 27 - 2 = 25.
    *   Numbers used: 27, 6, 4 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: -, - (fundamental arithmetic operations).
    *   Result: 25.

*   27 + (4 - 6) = 27 + (-2) = 25. **Another solution!**
    *   Equation: 27 + (4 - 6) = 27 + (-2) = 25.
    *   Numbers used: 27, 4, 6 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: +, - (fundamental arithmetic operations).
    *   Result: 25.

*   6 + (27 - 4) = 6 + 23 = 29
*   6 - (27 - 4) = 6 - 23 = -17
*   4 + (27 - 6) = 4 + 21 = 25. **Another solution!**
    *   Equation: 4 + (27 - 6) = 4 + 21 = 25.
    *   Numbers used: 4, 27, 6 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: +, - (fundamental arithmetic operations).
    *   Result: 25.

*   4 - (27 - 6) = 4 - 21 = -17

*   27 * (6 / 4) - not integer
*   (27 / 6) * 4 - not integer
*   (27 / 4) * 6 - not integer

Let's re-examine the division possibilities.
Could division be used to create a smaller number that then combines?
For example, if we could get 1 from division.
(6/6) = 1, but we only have one 6.
(4/4) = 1, but we only have one 4.
(27/27) = 1, but we only have one 27.

What if division results in a fraction that cancels out?
Consider (27 / x) * y or x * (y / 27).

Let's go back to the simplest ones found:
1. (27 - 6) + 4 = 25
2. 4 - (6 - 27) = 25
3. 27 - (6 - 4) = 25
4. 27 + (4 - 6) = 25
5. 4 + (27 - 6) = 25

All of these are valid. I will pick one that is straightforward. (27 - 6) + 4 is a good candidate. Another good one is 4 + (27 - 6).

Let's try to see if multiplication can be combined with subtraction/addition to get 25.
We saw 6 * 4 = 24. We need +1. Can we get +1 from 27? No, not",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4806,1948,"<think>The target is 45. The numbers available are 19, 38, and 90. I need to use each number exactly once with the four basic arithmetic operations.

Let's look at the numbers and the target. 45 is a multiple of 5 and 9.
The numbers are 19, 38, and 90.
90 is a large number. 38 is close to 40. 19 is close to 20.

Possible combinations:
1. Try to get close to 45 using two numbers and then adjust with the third.
   - 90 / 2 = 45. Can I get 2 from 19 and 38? No, not easily with basic operations.
   - 90 - 45 = 45. Can I get 45 from 19 and 38? 19 + 38 = 57. 38 - 19 = 19. 19 * 38 is too large. 38 / 19 = 2.
   - 90 + 19 = 109. 109 - 38 = 71.
   - 90 + 38 = 128. 128 - 19 = 109.
   - 90 - 19 = 71. 71 - 38 = 33.
   - 90 - 38 = 52. 52 - 19 = 33.
   - 19 * 38 is too big.
   - 19 * 90 is too big.
   - 38 * 90 is too big.
   - 90 / 19 is not an integer.
   - 90 / 38 is not an integer.
   - 38 / 19 = 2. Can I use 90 and 2 to get 45? 90 / 2 = 45. This looks promising.
     So, (38 / 19) = 2. Then 90 / 2 = 45.
     This uses 38, 19, and 90 exactly once.
     The equation would be 90 / (38 / 19).

Let's verify:
38 / 19 = 2
90 / 2 = 45

This works.

Are there other possibilities?
Let's consider multiplication first.
If I multiply two numbers, the result will be large.
19 * 38 = 722
19 * 90 = 1710
38 * 90 = 3420

If I use division with the large number first:
90 / 19 = not integer
90 / 38 = not integer

If I use division with smaller numbers:
38 / 19 = 2. Then I have 90 and 2. 90 / 2 = 45. This is the solution found above.
19 / 38 = 0.5. Then I have 90 and 0.5. 90 * 0.5 = 45. This is also a valid solution.
Equation: 90 * (19 / 38).
Let's verify:
19 / 38 = 0.5
90 * 0.5 = 45.
This also works.

Let's consider addition and subtraction.
We already tried combinations of addition and subtraction with one multiplication/division.
What if we have a structure like (A + B) * C or (A - B) * C?
(19 + 38) * 90 = 57 * 90 (too big)
(38 - 19) * 90 = 19 * 90 (too big)
(90 - 19) * 38 = 71 * 38 (too big)
(90 - 38) * 19 = 52 * 19 (too big)

What about (A * B) + C or (A * B) - C?
(19 * 38) + 90 = 722 + 90 = 812
(19 * 38) - 90 = 722 - 90 = 632
(19 * 90) + 38 = 1710 + 38 = 1748
(19 * 90) - 38 = 1710 - 38 = 1672
(38 * 90) + 19 = 3420 + 19 = 3439
(38 * 90) - 19 = 3420 - 19 = 3401

What about A + B + C, A + B - C, etc.?
19 + 38 + 90 = 147
19 + 38 - 90 = 57 - 90 = -33
19 - 38 + 90 = -19 + 90 = 71
-19 + 38 + 90 = 19 + 90 = 109
90 - 38 - 19 = 52 - 19 = 33
90 + 38 - 19 = 128 - 19 = 109
90 + 19 - 38 = 109 - 38 = 71

The most straightforward solutions involve division.
Solution 1: 90 / (38 / 19)
Solution 2: 90 * (19 / 38)

Both are valid. I will present one. The first one is perhaps more intuitive as it avoids decimals in the intermediate step if one were to calculate it manually. However, the problem statement doesn't restrict intermediate results from being non-integers. I'll go with the first one.

The problem requires me to use the numbers 18, 48, and 57 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target value of 27.

Let's list the numbers: {18, 48, 57}.
The target is 27.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

I need to consider all possible permutations of the numbers and all possible placements of the operators. Since there are 3 numbers, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operators, and each operator can be one of the 4 basic operations. However, the order of operations matters, so I need to consider parentheses as well.

Let's try to simplify the problem by looking at the numbers and the target.
The numbers are 18, 48, 57.
The target is 27.

Notice that 57 is close to 2 * 27 = 54, or 57 - 30 = 27.
Also, 48 is close to 2 * 27 = 54, or 48 + 9 = 57.
And 18 is related to 27 in that 27 - 18 = 9, or 18 + 9 = 27.

Let's try to combine two numbers first and then use the third.

Possibility 1: Start with 57.
Target is 27. So, I need to subtract 30 from 57. Can I make 30 from 18 and 48?
48 - 18 = 30.
So, 57 - (48 - 18) = 57 - 30 = 27.
This uses all numbers (57, 48, 18) exactly once and only allowed operations.
Let's check the order of operations.
57 - (48 - 18)
First, 48 - 18 = 30.
Then, 57 - 30 = 27.
This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to be thorough.

Possibility 2: Start with 48.
Target is 27.
If I add something to 48, it will be greater than 27.
If I subtract something from 48, I need to subtract 48 - 27 = 21. Can I make 21 from 18 and 57?
57 - 18 = 39 (not 21)
57 + 18 = 75 (not 21)
57 / 18 (not an integer)
18 / 57 (not an integer)
18 * 57 (too large)
So, subtracting from 48 doesn't seem to work easily.

What if I multiply or divide 48 by something?
If I multiply 48 by something, it will be much larger than 27.
If I divide 48 by something, I need to get a number that, when combined with 18 and 57, results in 27.
48 / 18 (not integer)
48 / 57 (not integer)

Possibility 3: Start with 18.
Target is 27.
If I add something to 18, I need to add 27 - 18 = 9. Can I make 9 from 48 and 57?
57 - 48 = 9.
So, 18 + (57 - 48) = 18 + 9 = 27.
This also uses all numbers (18, 57, 48) exactly once and only allowed operations.
Let's check the order of operations.
18 + (57 - 48)
First, 57 - 48 = 9.
Then, 18 + 9 = 27.
This is another valid solution.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 67, 4, and 81, exactly once each, with only the operations +, -, *, /, to achieve a result of 37.

Let's list the numbers: {67, 4, 81}
Target: 37

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the 4 types. This gives a large number of possibilities, but I can try to be systematic.

Let's consider the numbers and the target. 37 is a relatively small number compared to 67 and 81. This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the magnitude.

    - Equation: (6 * 14) - 35 + 4 = 53.

    - Numbers used: 6, 14, 35, 4. All used once.
    - Operations used: *, -, +. Allowed.

Let's try another combination just to be sure.
- 4 * 14 = 56. Remaining numbers are 35, 6. Target is 53.

    - 35 + 6 = 41. 56 - 41 = 15. Not 53.

The solution (6 * 14) - 35 + 4 = 53 seems correct.
I need to present it in the requested format.
The equation is (6 * 14) - 35 + 4.
Order of operations: Multiplication first, then subtraction, then addition.
6 * 14 = 84
84 - 35 = 49
49 + 4 = 53.

Alternative phrasing: 4 + (6 * 14) - 35 = 53.
Alternative phrasing: (14 * 6) - 35 + 4 = 53.
Alternative phrasing: 4 - 35 + (6 * 14) = 53.
Alternative phrasing: -35 + 4 + (6 * 14) = 53.

The simplest form is likely (6 * 14) - 35 + 4.
Or 6 * 14 - 35 + 4. Parentheses are not strictly necessary due to order of operations.
Let's use parentheses for clarity.
(6 * 14) - 35 + 4 = 53.
Or 4 + (6 * 14) - 35 = 53.
Or 4 - 35 + (6 * 14) = 53.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe division is involved.
- 35 / 6 (not integer)
- 35 / 4 (not integer)
- 35 / 14 (not integer)
- 6 / 4 (not integer)
- 6 / 14 (not integer)
- 4 / 6 (not integer)
- 4 / 14 (not integer)
- 14 / 6 (not integer)
- 14 / 4 (not integer)
- 14 / 35 (not integer)
- 4 / 35 (not integer)
- 6 / 35 (not integer)

It seems division of two numbers from the set does not yield an integer.
This means division must be the last operation, or part of a larger expression that results in an integer before division.
Or, division is used on a number that is a multiple of another number in the set.
For example, if we had 12 and 4, 12/4 = 3.

Let's re-examine the numbers: 35, 6, 4, 14.
Target: 53.

Consider 35. We need 18 more.
Can we get 18 from 6, 4, 14?
6 * 4 = 24. 24 - 14 = 10. No.
6 + 4 = 10. 10 + 14 = 24. No.
14 + 4 = 18. We have 6 left. 35 + 18 = 53. So 35 + 14 + 4 = 53. But we have 6 left. This doesn't work.

Consider 14. We need 39 more.
Can we get 39 from 35, 6, 4?
35 + 6 = 41. 41 - 4 = 37. No.

Can we get 47 from 35, 4, 14?

1.  **Multiplication first:**
    *   20 * 3 = 60. Then use 13. 60 - 13 = 47. This works!
    *   20 * 13 = 260. Then use 3. 260 + 3 or 260 - 3 is too far from 47.

2.  **Addition/Subtraction first:**
    *   20 + 3 = 23. Then use 13. 23 + 13 = 36 (too low). 23 - 13 = 10 (too low).

    *   20 - 13 = 7. Then use 3. 7 + 3 = 10 (too low). 7 - 3 = 4 (too low).
    *   3 + 13 = 16. Then use 20. 16 + 20 = 36 (too low). 16 - 20 = -4 (too low).
    *   13 - 3 = 10. Then use 20. 10 + 20 = 30 (too low). 10 - 20 = -10 (too low).

The combination (20 * 3) - 13 = 60 - 13 = 47 seems to be the correct one.

Let's try some combinations:
1.  Start with the largest number, 96.
    *   96 - ? = 79. The difference is 96 - 79 = 17. Can I make 17 from 6 and 95? No, not easily with basic operations. 95 - 6 = 89, 95 + 6 = 101, 95 * 6 = 570, 95 / 6 is not an integer.
    *   96 + ? = 79. This would require a negative number, which I can't directly form from 6 and 95.
    *   96 * ? = 79. Not possible with positive integers.
    *   96 / ? = 79. Not possible.

2.  Start with 95.
    *   95 - ? = 79. The difference is 95 - 79 = 16. Can I make 16 from 6 and 96?
        *   96 / 6 = 16. Yes!
        *   So, 95 - (96 / 6) = 95 - 16 = 79.

        *   This looks like a valid solution.

Let's double check:
Numbers used: 95, 96, 6. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, /. Basic arithmetic operations.
Result: 95 - (96 / 6) = 95 - 16 = 79. Target reached.

I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.
The numbers 74 and 83 are quite large compared to the target 12. This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce their values.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 83.
83 - ? = 12. This would require 71, which I can't make from 74 and 3.
83 / ? = 12. This would require a fraction, unlikely.

Possibility 2: Start with 74.
74 - ? = 12. This would require 62, which I can't make from 83 and 3.
74 / ? = 12. This would require a fraction, unlikely.

Possibility 3: Combine 74 and 83 first.
83 - 74 = 9. Now I have 9 and 3. 9 + 3 = 12. This works!
The operations used are subtraction and addition.
The numbers used are 83, 74, and 3. Each is used once.

Let's check the order of operations.
(83 - 74) + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12. This is correct.

Are there other possibilities?
What if I use 3 first?
3 * ? = 12. This would require 4. Can I make 4 from 74 and 83? No.
3 + ? = 12. This would require 9. Can I make 9 from 74 and 83? Yes, 83 - 74 = 9. So, 3 + (83 - 74) = 3 + 9 = 12. This is the same solution as above, just written differently.
3 - ? = 12. This would require -9. Can I make -9 from 74 and 83? No.

What if I use division?
74 / 3 is not a whole number.
83 / 3 is not a whole number.
74 / 83 is a fraction.
83 / 74 is a fraction.

Let's consider the structure (A op B) op C.
(83 - 74) + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12. (Uses 83, 74, 3)
(74 - 83) + 3 = -9 + 3 = -6.
(83 + 74) - 3 = 157 - 3 = 154.
(74 + 83) - 3 = 157 - 3 = 154.
(83 * 3) - 74 = 249 - 74 = 175.
(74 * 3) - 83 = 222 - 83 = 139.

Let's consider the structure A op (B op C).
83 - (74 + 3) = 83 - 77 = 6.
83 - (74 - 3) = 83 - 71 = 12. This works!
Numbers used: 83, 74, 3. Operations: -, -.
Let's check: 83 - (74 - 3) = 83 - 71 = 12. This is a valid solution.

74 - (83 - 3) = 74 - 80 = -6.
74 - (83 + 3) = 74 - 86 = -12.
3 + (83 - 74) = 3 + 9 = 12. This is the same as the first one.
3 + (74 - 83) = 3 + (-9) = -6.

Let's compare the two valid solutions found:
1. (83 - 74) + 3 = 12
2. 83 - (74 - 3) = 12

Both are valid. The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I will provide one.
The first one seems slightly more straightforward in terms of reducing the large numbers first.
(83 - 74) + 3 = 12.

Let's double check the second one: 83 - (74 - 3) = 12.

This approach of pairing and then combining might be too broad. Let's try to get closer to 69.

The numbers are roughly around 50-90. The target is 69.
Maybe a large number minus something, or a smaller number plus something.

Let's consider the largest number, 93.
93 - ? = 69. This means ? = 93 - 69 = 24.

53 * 71 = 3783

This suggests that division might be used to reduce a larger number or create a fractional part that cancels out. However, the target is an integer, so any division must result in an integer or be part of a calculation that results in an integer.

Let's try to combine three numbers first.
Target is 69.
Numbers are 53, 71, 73, 93.

Consider 93.
93 - (something from 53, 71, 73) = 69.
We need to make 24 from 53, 71, 73.
(73 - 53) = 20. Not 24.
(71 - 53) = 18. Not 24.
(73 - 71) = 2. Not 24.
(73 + 53) = 126.
(71 + 53) = 124.
(73 + 71) = 144.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe one of the numbers is multiplied by a small factor.
If we use 71, 71 * ? = 69. No.
If we use 73, 73 * ? = 69. No.
If we use 53, 53 * ? = 69. No.
If we use 93, 93 * ? = 69. No.

Let's try to get close to 69 by combining two numbers and then adjusting with the other two.

124 - ? = 69. ? = 124 - 69 = 55.
Can we make 55 from 73 and 93?
93 - 73 = 20. No.
93 + 73 = 166. No.
93 * 73 = 6789. No.
93 / 73 (not integer).

Example: 73 + 53 = 126. Need to get from 126 to 69 using 71 and 93.

93 + 71 = 164. No.

Example: 93 + 53 = 146. Need to get from 146 to 69 using 71 and 73.

Can we make 77 from 71 and 73?
73 - 71 = 2. No.
73 + 71 = 144. No.

Example: 71 + 73 = 144. Need to get from 144 to 69 using 53 and 93.
144 - ? = 69. ? = 144 - 69 = 75.
Can we make 75 from 53 and 93?
93 - 53 = 40. No.
93 + 53 = 146. No.

Let's try subtraction first.
Example: 93 - 73 = 20. Need to get from 20 to 69 using 53 and 71.
20 + ? = 69. ? = 49.
Can we make 49 from 53 and 71?
71 - 53 = 18. No.
71 + 53 = 124. No.

Example: 93 - 71 = 22. Need to get from 22 to 69 using 53 and 73.
22 + ? = 69. ? = 47.
Can we make 47 from 53 and 73?
73 - 53 = 20. No.
73 + 53 = 126. No.

Example: 73 - 71 = 2. Need to get from 2 to 69 using 53 and 93.
2 + ? = 69. ? = 67.
Can we make 67 from 53 and 93?
93 - 53 = 40. No.
93 + 53 = 146. No.

Let's try multiplication involving one of the numbers.
Maybe (93 - 71) * ? = 69.
22 * ? = 69. No integer solution.

Maybe (73 - 53) * ? = 69.
20 * ? = 69. No integer solution.

Maybe (71 - 53) * ? = 69.
18 * ? = 69. No integer solution.

Let's try division.
Maybe 93 / 3 = 31. Can we make 3 from 53, 71, 73? No.
Maybe 71 / ? = 69. No.
Maybe 7",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4698,1788,"<think>The problem requires us to use the numbers 4, 71, 11, and 61 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target number 76.

Let's list the numbers: [4, 71, 11, 61]
Target: 76

I need to explore different combinations and orderings of these numbers and operations.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to the target and then use the remaining numbers to adjust.
3. Consider the properties of the numbers (e.g., even/odd, prime).

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.
- 71 * 4 = 284. This is much larger than 76. I'd need to subtract a lot. (11, 61 remaining). 284 - 11 - 61 = 212. Not 76.
- 71 * 11 = 781. Too large.
- 71 * 61 = very large.
- 11 * 4 = 44. (71, 61 remaining). 44 + 71 - 61 = 54. Not 76. 44 + 61 - 71 = 34. Not 76. 44 - 71 + 61 = 34. Not 76.
- 11 * 61 = 671. Too large.
- 4 * 61 = 244. Too large.

Attempt 2: Using addition and subtraction primarily.
- 71 + 11 = 82. (4, 61 remaining). 82 + 4 - 61 = 25. Not 76. 82 - 4 - 61 = 17. Not 76. 82 + 61 - 4 = 139. Not 76.
- 71 + 61 = 132. (4, 11 remaining). 132 - 4 - 11 = 117. Not 76. 132 - 11 - 4 = 117. Not 76.
- 71 + 4 = 75. (11, 61 remaining). 75 + 11 - 61 = 25. Not 76. 75 - 11 + 61 = 125. Not 76. 75 + 61 - 11 = 125. Not 76.
- 61 + 11 = 72. (4, 71 remaining). 72 + 4 - 71 = 5. Not 76. 72 - 4 + 71 = 139. Not 76. 72 + 71 - 4 = 139. Not 76.
- 61 + 4 = 65. (11, 71 remaining). 65 + 11 - 71 = 5. Not 76. 65 - 11 + 71 = 125. Not 76.
- 11 + 4 = 15. (71, 61 remaining). 15 + 71 - 61 = 25. Not 76. 15 + 61 - 71 = 5. Not 76.

Attempt 3: Trying division. Division can be tricky as it might not result in integers.
- 71 / 4 is not an integer.
- 71 / 11 is not an integer.
- 71 / 61 is not an integer.
- 11 / 4 is not an integer.
- 61 / 4 is not an integer.
- 61 / 11 is not an integer.
- 4 / 11, 4 / 61, 4 / 71 are small fractions.
- 11 / 61, 11 / 71 are small fractions.
- 61 / 71 is a small fraction.

Let's reconsider the target 76.
We have 71, which is close to 76.
If we have 71, we need to get +5 from the remaining numbers (4, 11, 61).
Can we get 5 from 4, 11, 61?
- 11 - 6 = 5. Can we get 6 from 4 and 61? No.
- 61 - 56 = 5. Can we get 56 from 4 and 11? 4 * 11 = 44. No.
- 4 + 1 = 5. Can we get 1 from 11 and 61? No.
- 11 - 4 - ? = 5. 7 - ? = 5. ? = 2. Can we get 2 from 61? No.
- 61 - 11 - 4 = 46. Not 5.
- 61 - (11 * 4) = 61 - 44 = 17. Not 5.
- (61 - 11) / 4 = 50 / 4. Not integer.
- (61 + 4) - 11 = 65 - 11 = 54. Not 5.
- (11 + 4) - 61 = 15 - 61 = -46. Not 5.

Let's try starting with 61. We need +15 from (4, 11, 71).
- 71 - 4 - 11 = 56. Not 15.
- 71 - (11 * 4) = 71 - 44 = 27. Not 15.
- 71 - 11 + 4 = 64. Not 15.
- 71 + 4 - 11 = 64. Not 15.
- 11 + 4 = 15. So, 61 + (11 + 4) = 76. This uses 61, 11, 4. We still have 71 left. This doesn't work.

Let's try starting with 11. We need +65 from (4, 71, 61).
- 71 + 61 - 4 = 128. Not 65.
- 71 + 4 - 61 = 14. Not 65.
- 61 + 4 - 71 = -6. Not 65.

Let's try starting with 4. We need +72 from (71, 11, 61).
- 71 + 11 - 61 = 21. Not 72.
- 71 + 61 - 11 = 121. Not 72.
- 61 + 11 - 71 = 3. Not 72.

Let's think about how to get a number slightly larger than 76 and subtract.
Or a number slightly smaller and add.

Consider 71. We need 5.
Consider 61. We need 15.
Consider 11. We need 65.
Consider 4. We need 72.

Let's try combining two numbers to get a useful intermediate.
- 71 + 4 = 75. Need 1 from (11, 61). No.
- 71 - 4 = 67. Need 9 from (11, 61). No.
- 71 + 11 = 82. Need -6 from (4, 61). No.
- 71 - 11 = 60. Need 16 from (4, 61). No.
- 71 + 61 = 132. Need -56 from (4, 11). No.
- 71 - 61 = 10. Need 66 from (4, 11). No.
- 11 + 4 = 15. Need 61 from (71, 61). No.
- 11 - 4 = 7. Need 69 from (71, 61). No.
- 61 + 4 = 65. Need 11 from (",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 11, 59, 3, and 86 exactly once, with only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target number 13.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest numbers:**
    *   86 and 59. Their difference is 27.
    *   Can we get 13 from 11 and 3 and 27?
    *   27 - 11 - 3 = 13. This works!
    *   So, (86 - 59) - 11 - 3 = 27 - 11 - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 86, 59, 11, 3 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: -, -, - (basic arithmetic).
Result: 13.

This seems like a valid solution.

Let's try another approach just to be sure or to see if there are other solutions.

2.  **Try multiplication:**
    *   11 * 3 = 33.
    *   Can we get 13 from 59, 86, and 33?
    *   86 - 59 = 27.
    *   33 - 27 = 6. Not 13.
    *   59 - 33 = 26.
    *   86 - 26 = 60. Not 13.

3.  **Try division:**
    *   86 / ? - not easily divisible by 3 or 11.
    *   59 / ? - not easily divisible by 3 or 11.
    *   11 / ? - not easily divisible by 3 or 86.
    *   3 / ? - not easily divisible by 11 or 86.

4.  **Revisit the first successful attempt:**
    (86 - 59) - 11 - 3 = 13.
    This is a straightforward and correct solution.

Let's consider order of operations. Parentheses are allowed implicitly by the order of operations or explicitly.
(86 - 59) - 11 - 3 = 13 is clear.
If we write 86 - 59 - 11 - 3, it also evaluates to 13 from left to right.

Let's try another structure:
*   (86 + 3) = 89
*   (59 - 11) = 48
*   89 - 48 = 41. Not 13.

*   (59 + 11) = 70
*   (86 - 3) = 83
*   83 - 70 = 13. This also works!
    So, (86 - 3) - (59 + 11) = 83 - 70 = 13.
    Numbers used: 86, 3, 59, 11 (all used exactly once).
    Operations used: -, +, - (basic arithmetic).
    Result: 13.

This is another valid solution. The user asked for *an* equation. The first one is simpler.

Let's try to use multiplication differently.
*   (59 - 3) = 56
*   (86 / 11) - not integer.

*   (86 - 11) = 75
*   (59 / 3) - not integer.

*   (59 + 3) = 62
*   (86 - 11) = 75
*   75 - 62 = 13. This also works!
    So, (86 - 11) - (59 + 3) = 75 - 62 = 13.
    Numbers used: 86, 11, 59, 3 (all used exactly once).
    Operations used: -, +, - (basic arithmetic).
    Result: 13.

This is a third valid solution.

Let's try division with a result that can be used.
*   86 / 2 = 43 (but we don't have 2)
*   59 / ?
*   11 / ?
*   3 / ?

Let's try to get a number that divides nicely.
*   (59 + 11) = 70
*   (86 - 3) = 83

*   (86 + 59) = 145
*   (11 * 3) = 33
*   145 - 33 = 112. Not 13.

*   (86 - 59) = 27
*   (11 + 3) = 14
*   27 - 14 = 13. This also works!
    So, (86 - 59) - (11 + 3) = 27 - 14 = 13.
    Numbers used: 86, 59, 11, 3 (all used exactly once).
    Operations used: -, +, - (basic arithmetic).
    Result: 13.

This is a fourth valid solution.

The simplest one is likely (86 - 59) - 11 - 3.
Or (86 - 59) - (11 + 3).

Let's try to use multiplication to get a smaller number.
*   3 * 11 = 33
*   86 - 59 = 27
*   33 - 27 = 6. Not 13.
*   27 - 33 = -6. Not 13.

*   3 * 59 = 177
*   86 - 11 = 75
*   177 - 75 = 102. Not 13.

*   3 * 86 = 258
*   59 - 11 = 48
*   258 - 48 = 210. Not 13.

Let's try division that results in an integer.
*   86 / ?
*   59 / ?
*   11 / ?
*   3 / ?

It seems unlikely that division will be the primary operation leading to 13 with these numbers.

Let's stick with the subtraction/addition combinations.
The first one found: (86 - 59) - 11 - 3 = 13.
This is concise and uses only subtraction.

Let's check if any other simple combinations work.
*   86 - 11 = 75
*   59 - 3 = 56
*   75 - 56 = 19. Not 13.

*   86 - 3 = 83
*   59 - 11 = 48
*   83 - 48 = 35. Not 13.

*   59 - 11 = 48
*   86 - 3 = 83
*   48 - 83 = -35. Not 13.

*   59 - 3 = 56
*   86 - 11 = 75
*   56 - 75 = -19. Not 13.

The solution (86 - 59) - 11 - 3 = 13 is the most straightforward.
Another good one is (86 - 59) - (11 + 3) = 13.
And (86 - 11) - (59 + 3) = 13.
And (86 - 3) - (59 + 11) = 13.

I will provide the first one found as it's the simplest in terms of operations.
(86 - 59) - 11 - 3 = 13.
This uses 86, 59, 11, 3.
Operations are -, -, -.
Result is 13.
All conditions met.

2979,247,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 34, 36, and 98 to reach the result 100. Each number must be used exactly once, and the allowed operators are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: 34, 36, 98.
Target: 100.

I need to try different combinations of operators and the order of operations.

Possible combinations:
1. (34 op1 36) op2 98 = 100
2. (34 op1 98) op2 36 = 100
3. (36 op1 98) op2 34 = 100
4. 34 op1 (36 op2 98) = 100
5. 36 op1 (34 op2 98) = 100
6. 98 op1 (34 op2 36) = 100

Let's start with the largest number, 98, and see how we can get close to 100.

Possibility 1: Using 98 directly.
If we have 98, we need to get +2 from the remaining numbers (34 and 36).
Can we get 2 from 34 and 36 using +, -, *, /?
36 - 34 = 2. Yes!
So, 98 + (36 - 34) = 98 + 2 = 100.
This uses all numbers (34, 36, 98) exactly once and only allowed operators.

Let's verify this.
Numbers used: 34, 36, 98. All used.
Operators used: +, -. Allowed.
Result: 100. Correct.

This seems like a valid solution. I should check if there are other simple ones, but this one is straightforward.

Let's try other combinations just to be sure or to explore.

What if we multiply?
34 * 36 is too large.
34 * 98 is too large.
36 * 98 is too large.

What if we divide?
98 / 34 is not an integer.
98 / 36 is not an integer.
36 / 34 is not an integer.
34 / 36 is not an integer.
36 / 98 is not an integer.
34 / 98 is not an integer.

Let's consider combinations that might result in numbers that can be added/subtracted to 100.

Try starting with 36.
We need to get 100 from 36, 34, 98.
If we do 36 + something = 100, we need 64. Can we get 64 from 34 and 98?
98 - 34 = 64. Yes!
So, 36 + (98 - 34) = 36 + 64 = 100.
This also works. Numbers used: 36, 98, 34. Operators: +, -. Result: 100.

Try starting with 34.
We need to get 100 from 34, 36, 98.
If we do 34 + something = 100, we need 66. Can we get 66 from 36 and 98?
98 - 36 = 62. No.
36 + 98 = 134. No.
36 * 98 is too big.
98 / 36 is not integer.
36 / 98 is not integer.

Let's consider the first solution found: 98 + (36 - 34) = 100.
This is a valid and simple solution.

Let's consider the second solution found: 36 + (98 - 34) = 100.
This is also a valid solution.

The problem asks for ""an equation"". Either one is fine. I'll present the first one I found.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Numbers: [34 36 98] - used exactly once. Yes.
- Operators: +, -, *, / - used. Yes, + and -.
- Result: 100. Yes.

The equation is 98 + (36 - 34) = 100.
The order of operations is important. Parentheses ensure 36 - 34 is calculated first.

Let's write down the steps clearly.
1. Identify the target number (100) and the available numbers (34, 36, 98).
2. Consider the largest number, 98. To reach 100, we need to add 2.
3. Check if the remaining numbers (34 and 36) can produce 2 using the allowed operators.
4. Calculate 36 - 34 = 2. This uses the remaining numbers and the subtraction operator.
5. Combine the results: 98 + (36 - 34) = 98 + 2 = 100.
6. Verify that all numbers (34, 36, 98) are used exactly once and only allowed operators (+, -) are used. The result is 100.

The alternative solution:
1. Identify the target number (100) and the available numbers (34, 36, 98).
2. Consider the number 36. To reach 100, we need to add 64.
3. Check if the remaining numbers (34 and 98) can produce 64 using the allowed operators.
4. Calculate 98 - 34 = 64. This uses the remaining numbers and the subtraction operator.
5. Combine the results: 36 + (98 - 34) = 36 + 64 = 100.
6. Verify that all numbers (34, 36, 98) are used exactly once and only allowed operators (+, -) are used. The result is 100.

Both are valid. I will present the first one.

The problem asks us to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers [1, 47, 51, 16] exactly once, with operations +, -, *, /, to reach a target value of 21.

Let's list the numbers: N = {1, 16, 47, 51}. Target = 21.

We need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. The order of operations matters, so we'll need to consider parentheses.

Let's try some initial combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
Maybe 51 and 47 are involved in subtraction or division to reduce their values.
51 - 47 = 4. Then we have {1, 16, 4}. Target 21.
Can we get 21 from {1, 16, 4}?
16 + 4 + 1 = 21. This looks promising.
So, the expression could be (51 - 47) + 16 + 1.
Let's check: (51 - 47) + 16 + 1 = 4 + 16 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21.
This uses all numbers {1, 16, 47, 51} exactly once.
The operations are subtraction and addition.
The result is 21.
This seems like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to be thorough.

Possibility 2: Multiplication.
If we multiply 16 by something, it might get too large quickly.
16 * 1 = 16. Remaining {47, 51}. Target 21.
Can we get 21 from {16, 47, 51}?
51 - 47 = 4. 16 + 4 = 20. Not 21.
47 - 51 is negative.
47 + 51 = 98. 16 + 98 is too large.
51 / 47 is not an integer.
47 / 51 is not an integer.

What if 16 is multiplied by a result of other numbers?
Let's try to get a small number to multiply 16 by.
(51 - 47) = 4. Then we have {1, 16, 4}.
16 * 1 = 16. Remaining {4, 16}. Target 21.
16 + 4 = 20. Not 21.

Let's try to get a number close to 21 using some numbers, and then adjust with the others.
47 + 1 = 48. Remaining {16, 51}. Target 21.
Can we get 21 from {48, 16, 51}?
51 - 16 = 35. 48 - 35 = 13. Not 21.
51 + 16 = 67. 48 - 67 is negative.
48 / 16 = 3. Remaining {3, 51}. Target 21.
51 - 3 = 48. Not 21.
51 + 3 = 54. Not 21.

Let's try division.
51 / 1 = 51. Remaining {16, 47}. Target 21.
Can we get 21 from {51, 16, 47}?
51 - 16 = 35. 35 - 47 is negative.
51 - 47 = 4. 4 + 16 = 20. Not 21.
47 - 16 = 31. 51 - 31 = 20. Not 21.

47 / 1 = 47. Remaining {16, 51}. Target 21.
Can we get 21 from {47, 16, 51}?
51 - 16 = 35. 47 - 35 = 12. Not 21.
51 + 16 = 67. 47 - 67 is negative.

16 / 1 = 16. Remaining {47, 51}. Target 21.
Can we get 21 from {16, 47, 51}?
51 - 47 = 4. 16 + 4 = 20. Not 21.

Let's consider the expression (51 - 47) + 16 + 1 again.
Numbers used: 51, 47, 16, 1. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +, +. Allowed operations.
Evaluation: (51 - 47) + 16 + 1 = 4 + 16 + 1 = 21. Target reached.

Let's try to see if there are other ways to group the operations.
What if we try to get 21 by multiplying two numbers?
No two numbers from {1, 16, 47, 51} multiply to 21.

What if we try to get 21 by dividing two numbers?
No two numbers from {1, 16, 47, 51} divide to 21.

Let's try to construct an expression that results in 21.
We have numbers {1, 16, 47, 51}. Target 21.

Consider the expression: 51 - (47 - 16 + 1)
51 - (30 + 1) = 51 - 31 = 20. Not 21.

Consider the expression: 51 - (47 - 16) - 1
51 - 31 - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19. Not 21.

Consider the expression: 47 - (51 - 16 - 1)
47 - (35 - 1) = 47 - 34 = 13. Not 21.

Consider the expression: 47 - (51 - 16) + 1
47 - 35 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13. Not 21.

Consider the expression: 16 + (51 - 47) + 1
16 + 4 + 1 = 21. This is the same as the first one, just reordered.

Consider the expression: 16 + 51 - 47 + 1
16 + 51 = 67. 67 - 47 = 20. 20 + 1 = 21.
This is also a valid solution. The order of operations without parentheses is multiplication/division first, then addition/subtraction from left to right.
16 + 51 - 47 + 1 = (16 + 51) - 47 + 1 = 67 - 47 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21.
This uses all numbers {1, 16, 47, 51} exactly once.
Operations are +, -, +. Allowed operations.
Result is 21.

Let's try another one.
Consider the expression: 47 + 1 - (51 - 16)
47 + 1 - 35 = 48 - 35 = 13. Not 21.

Consider the expression: 47 - 16 + 51 - 1
47 - 16 = 31. 31 + 51 = 82. 82 - 1 = 81. Not 21.

Consider the expression: 51 + 1 - 47 + 16
51 + 1 = 52. 52 - 47 = 5. 5 + 16 = 21.
This is another valid solution.
Numbers used: 51, 1, 47, 16. All used exactly once.
Operations used: +, -, +. Allowed operations.
Evaluation: 51 + 1 - 47 + 16 = (51 + 1) - 47 + 16 = 52 - 47 + 16 = 5 + 16 = 21.

Let's try to use multiplication in a different way.
Can we get a number that, when added/subtracted from another, gives 21?
For example, if we have X + Y = 21.
Let X = 16. Then Y = 5. Can we get ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants me to create a mathematical equation using the numbers 81, 77, and 72 exactly once.
The equation must evaluate to 76.
I can only use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: [81, 77, 72]
Target: 76

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation has 4 choices. This gives a large number of possibilities, but I can try to be strategic.

Let's consider the target value, 76. It's relatively close to the given numbers.
81 is slightly above 76.
77 is slightly above 76.
72 is slightly below 76.

This suggests that subtraction might be involved to reduce larger numbers or addition might be involved to increase smaller numbers.

Let's try some combinations systematically.

Permutation 1: 81, 77, 72
Possible structures:
1. (81 op1 77) op2 72
2. 81 op1 (77 op2 72)

Let's try structure 1: (81 op1 77) op2 72
- (81 + 77) + 72 = 158 + 72 = 230 (Too high)
- (81 + 77) - 72 = 158 - 72 = 86 (Close, but not 76)
- (81 + 77) * 72 = 158 * 72 (Too high)
- (81 + 77) / 72 = 158 / 72 (Not an integer, unlikely to reach 76)

- (81 - 77) + 72 = 4 + 72 = 76 (This works!)
Let's check the constraints:
- Numbers used: 81, 77, 72 (all used exactly once)
- Operations used: -, + (fundamental arithmetic operations)
- Target value: 76 (achieved)

This looks like a valid solution. Let's double-check.
Equation: (81 - 77) + 72
Step 1: 81 - 77 = 4
Step 2: 4 + 72 = 76

The equation is (81 - 77) + 72 = 76.

Let's explore other possibilities briefly to ensure this is a good candidate and to practice the process.

Consider structure 2: 81 op1 (77 op2 72)
- 81 + (77 + 72) = 81 + 149 = 230
- 81 + (77 - 72) = 81 + 5 = 86 (Close again)
- 81 + (77 * 72) = 81 + 5544 (Too high)
- 81 + (77 / 72) (Not integer)

- 81 - (77 + 72) = 81 - 149 (Negative)
- 81 - (77 - 72) = 81 - 5 = 76 (This also works!)
Let's check this one: 81 - (77 - 72) = 76
Step 1: 77 - 72 = 5
Step 2: 81 - 5 = 76
Constraints check:
- Numbers used: 81, 77, 72 (all used exactly once)
- Operations used: -, - (fundamental arithmetic operations)
- Target value: 76 (achieved)

So, I have found two potential solutions:
1. (81 - 77) + 72 = 76
2. 81 - (77 - 72) = 76

The prompt asks for ""a valid mathematical equation"". Either one is fine. I will present the first one I found as it's slightly simpler in terms of parenthesis nesting.

Let's try another permutation just for practice.
Permutation 2: 81, 72, 77
- (81 - 72) + 77 = 9 + 77 = 86 (Close)
- 81 - (72 - 77) = 81 - (-5) = 86 (Close)
- 81 - (77 - 72) = 76 (This is the second solution I found, just reordered)

Permutation 3: 77, 81, 72
- (77 + 81) - 72 = 158 - 72 = 86 (Close)
- (77 - 81) + 72 = -4 + 72 = 68 (Not 76)
- 77 - (81 - 72) = 77 - 9 = 68 (Not 76)
- 77 + (81 - 72) = 77 + 9 = 86 (Close)

Permutation 4: 77, 72, 81
- (77 + 72) - 81 = 149 - 81 = 68 (Not 76)
- (77 - 72) + 81 = 5 + 81 = 86 (Close)
- 77 - (72 - 81) = 77 - (-9) = 86 (Close)
- 77 + (72 - 81) = 77 + (-9) = 68 (Not 76)

Permutation 5: 72, 81, 77
- (72 + 81) - 77 = 153 - 77 = 76 (This works!)
Let's check this one: (72 + 81) - 77 = 76
Step 1: 72 + 81 = 153
Step 2: 153 - 77 = 76
Constraints check:
- Numbers used: 72, 81, 77 (all used exactly once)
- Operations used: +, - (fundamental arithmetic operations)
- Target value: 76 (achieved)

So, I have found three potential solutions:
1. (81 - 77) + 72 = 76
2. 81 - (77 - 72) = 76
3. (72 + 81) - 77 = 76

All three are valid. I will pick one to present. The first one is clear and uses a mix of operations.

Let's do a final self-check on (81 - 77) + 72 = 76.
Numbers: 81, 77, 72. All used.
Operations: -, +. Allowed.
Target: 76.
Calculation: 81 - 77 = 4. 4 + 72 = 76. Correct.

Let's do a final self-check on 81 - (77 - 72) = 76.
Numbers: 81, 77, 72. All used.
Operations: -, -. Allowed.
Target: 76.
Calculation: 77 - 72 = 5. 81 - 5 = 76. Correct.

Let's do a final self-check on (72 + 81) - 77 = 76.
Numbers: 72, 81, 77. All used.
Operations: +, -. Allowed.
Target: 76.
Calculation: 72 + 81 = 153. 153 - 77 = 76. Correct.

I will present the first one found: (81 - 77) + 72 = 76.
It's important to ensure the equation is presented clearly. Parentheses are necessary for order of operations.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to the target and then use the remaining numbers to adjust.
3. Consider the parity of the numbers and the target.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(97 - 10) = 87
87 - 66 = 21

Attempt 7:
(97 + 9) = 106
106 - 66 = 40
40 + 10 = 50 (Not 59)

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe one of the numbers needs to be multiplied by a small result from others.

Attempt 8:
(10 + 9) = 19
97 - 66 = 31
19 + 31 = 50 (Not 59)

Attempt 9:
(66 / 10) - not an integer. Division might be tricky.

Let's try to get close to 59.
Maybe 66 is involved in subtraction.
If we have something like X - 66 = 59, then X = 125. Can we make 125 from 10, 97, 9?
97 + 10 + 9 = 116 (No)
97 * 10 = 970 (Too big)

If we have 66 - X = 59, then X = 7. Can we make 7 from 10, 97, 9?
9 - 10 = -1 (No)
10 - 9 = 1 (No)

If we have X * Y = 59. 59 is prime. So one number must be 59 or 1.
We don't have 59 or 1 directly.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with another, gets us closer.
Consider 97.
97 - X = 59 => X = 38. Can we make 38 from 10, 66, 9?
66 - 10 - 9 = 47 (No)
66 - (10+9) = 47 (No)
66 - 9 = 57. 57 - 10 = 47 (No)
10 * 9 = 90. 90 - 66 = 24 (No)

Consider 66.
66 - X = 59 => X = 7. Can we make 7 from 10, 97, 9? No.

97 - 66 = 31. 31 + 9 = 40 (No)
97 - 9 = 88. 88 - 66 = 22 (No)
66 - 9 = 57. 57 - 97 = -40 (No)

Consider 9.
9 + X = 59 => X = 50. Can we make 50 from 10, 97, 66?
97 - 66 = 31. 31 + 10 = 41 (No)
66 - 10 = 56. 56 - 97 = -41 (No)
97 - 10 = 87. 87 - 66 = 21 (No)

Let's try multiplication with one of the smaller numbers.
Maybe 9 * X = something close to 59.
9 * 6 = 54. Can we make 6 from 10, 97, 66? No.
9 * 7 = 63. Can we make 7 from 10, 97, 66? No.

Let's try division.
Maybe (X / Y) + Z + W = 59.
Or X - (Y / Z) + W = 59.

Let's try to make a number that, when subtracted from another, gives a result that can be adjusted.
(97 - 10) = 87

87 - 57 = 30 (No)

(97 - 66) = 31

Let's try to use multiplication to get a larger intermediate number.
(10 * 9) = 90

(97 * 10) = 970 (Too big)
(97 * 9) = 873 (Too big)

(66 / 9) - not integer.
(97 / 10) - not integer.
(97 / 66) - not integer.
(66 / 10) - not integer.
(10 / 9) - not integer.
(9 / 10) - not integer.

This suggests that division might be used in a way that results in an integer, or it's part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

15 + 3 = 18

This is a valid solution.

Are there other possibilities?
Let's try starting with 46.
*   46 / 3 is not an integer.
*   46 * 3 = 138. Then I have 61. 138 - 61 = 77 (not 18). 138 + 61 = 199 (not 18).
*   46 + 3 = 49. Then I have 61. 61 - 49 = 12 (not 18). 49 - 61 = -12 (not 18). 49 + 61 = 110 (not 18).
*   46 - 3 = 43. Then I have 61. 61 - 43 = 18. This also works!
    *   The numbers used are 46, 3, and 61.
    *   The operations used are - and -.
    *   The equation is (46 - 3) - 61 = 18. Let's check: 46 - 3 = 43. 43 - 61 = -18. This is not 18.
    *   Let's try 61 - (46 - 3) = 61 - 43 = 18. This also works!
        *   Numbers: 61, 46, 3. Operations: -, -. Target: 18.
        *   Equation: 61 - (46 - 3) = 18.

Let's try starting with 3.
*   3 * 46 = 138. Then 61. 138 - 61 = 77.
*   3 + 46 = 49. Then 61. 61 - 49 = 12.
*   3 - 46 = -43. Then 61. 61 - (-43) = 104. -43 - 61 = -104.
*   3 * 61 = 183. Then 46. 183 - 46 = 137.
*   3 + 61 = 64. Then 46. 64 - 46 = 18. This works!
    *   Numbers: 3, 61, 46. Operations: +, -. Target: 18.
    *   Equation: (3 + 61) - 46 = 18.
    *   Check: 3 + 61 = 64. 64 - 46 = 18.

I have found three valid solutions:
1.  (61 - 46) + 3 = 18
2.  61 - (46 - 3) = 18
3.  (3 + 61) - 46 = 18

The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I will present the first one I found as it's straightforward.

4939,617,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 25, 63, and 18 exactly once, along with the arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to form an equation that evaluates to 20.

Let's list the numbers: {25, 63, 18}.
We need to reach the target value of 20.

We can try different combinations of operations and number orderings.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's try combining two numbers first and then incorporating the third.

Combination 1: (25 op1 63) op2 18 = 20
Combination 2: (25 op1 18) op2 63 = 20
Combination 3: (63 op1 25) op2 18 = 20

Combination 5: (18 op1 25) op2 63 = 20
Combination 6: (18 op1 63) op2 25 = 20

Let's explore these systematically.

Try Combination 1: (25 op1 63) op2 18 = 20
- (25 + 63) op2 18 = 88 op2 18.
  - 88 + 18 = 106 (not 20)
  - 88 - 18 = 70 (not 20)
  - 88 * 18 = 1584 (not 20)

  - -38 + 18 = -20 (close, but not 20)
  - -38 - 18 = -56 (not 20)
  - -38 * 18 = -684 (not 20)
  - -38 / 18 = -2.11... (not 20)
- (63 - 25) op2 18 = 38 op2 18.
  - 38 + 18 = 56 (not 20)
  - 38 - 18 = 20. This works! The equation is (63 - 25) - 18 = 20.
  Let's verify: 63 - 25 = 38. Then 38 - 18 = 20.
  All numbers (25, 63, 18) are used exactly once.
  The operations are subtraction.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough.

Try Combination 2: (25 op1 18) op2 63 = 20
- (25 + 18) op2 63 = 43 op2 63.
  - 43 + 63 = 106
  - 43 - 63 = -20 (close, but not 20)
  - 63 - 43 = 20. This works! The equation is (63 - (25 + 18)) = 20.
  Let's verify: 25 + 18 = 43. Then 63 - 43 = 20.
  All numbers (25, 63, 18) are used exactly once.
  The operations are addition and subtraction.

We have found two valid solutions:
1. (63 - 25) - 18 = 20
2. 63 - (25 + 18) = 20

The problem asks for ""an equation"". Either one is fine. I will present the first one found.

Let's consider other combinations briefly to ensure no simpler or more obvious one was missed.

Try Combination 4: (63 op1 18) op2 25 = 20
- (63 + 18) op2 25 = 81 op2 25.
  - 81 - 25 = 56 (not 20)
- (63 - 18) op2 25 = 45 op2 25.
  - 45 - 25 = 20. This works! The equation is (63 - 18) - 25 = 20.
  Let's verify: 63 - 18 = 45. Then 45 - 25 = 20.
  All numbers (25, 63, 18) are used exactly once.
  The operations are subtraction.

So we have found three solutions:
1. (63 - 25) - 18 = 20
2. 63 - (25 + 18) = 20
3. (63 - 18) - 25 = 20

All are valid. I will choose the first one found.

1033,1285,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 63, 4, 83, and 58, along with the operators +, -, *, /, to reach the target number 82. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [63, 4, 83, 58]
Target: 82

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(83 + 63) = 146. Need to get from 146 to 82 using 4 and 58. 146 - 58 = 88. 88 - 4 = 84. Close.
(83 - 63) = 20. Need to get from 20 to 82 using 4 and 58. 20 + 58 = 78. 78 + 4 = 82. This works!

Let's check the numbers used: 83, 63, 58, 4. All used once.
Let's check the operators used: -, +, +. This uses '+' twice, which is allowed.

So, the equation is (83 - 63) + 58 + 4 = 82.

Let's verify:
83 - 63 = 20
20 + 58 = 78
78 + 4 = 82

This is a valid solution.

Let's try another approach to be sure or to find alternatives.

Possibility 2: Multiplication might be involved.
Maybe multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the others.
63 * 4 = 252. Too large.
63 * 83 = very large.
63 * 58 = very large.
4 * 83 = 332. Too large.
4 * 58 = 232. Too large.
83 * 58 = very large.

So, multiplication of two numbers is unlikely to be the first step unless it's followed by division.

Possibility 3: Division.
63 / 4 is not an integer.
63 / 83 is not an integer.
63 / 58 is not an integer.
4 / 63 is not an integer.
4 / 83 is not an integer.
4 / 58 is not an integer.
83 / 4 is not an integer.
83 / 63 is not an integer.
83 / 58 is not an integer.
58 / 4 is not an integer.
58 / 63 is not an integer.
58 / 83 is not an integer.

This suggests division might not be the first operation, or it might be part of a larger expression that results in an integer.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: (83 - 63) + 58 + 4 = 82.
This is a simple and valid solution.

Let's try to arrange the numbers differently.
What if 4 is used to divide something?
(63 + 58) = 121. 121 / 4 is not integer.
(83 + 58) = 141. 141 / 4 is not integer.
(83 + 63) = 146. 146 / 4 is not integer.
(63 - 58) = 5. 5 / 4 is not integer.
(83 - 58) = 25. 25 / 4 is not integer.
(83 - 63) = 20. 20 / 4 = 5. Now we have 5 and 58. 5 + 58 = 63. Not 82. 58 - 5 = 53. Not 82.

What if 4 is used to multiply something?
(83 - 63) = 20. 20 * 4 = 80. Now we have 80 and 58. 80 + 58 = 138. 80 - 58 = 22. 58 - 80 is negative.
(58 - 63) is negative.
(63 - 58) = 5. 5 * 4 = 20. Now we have 20 and 83. 20 + 83 = 103. 83 - 20 = 63.

Let's reconsider the first solution: (83 - 63) + 58 + 4 = 82.
This is a perfectly valid solution.

Let's try to see if there's another one.
Maybe start with 58.
58 + 63 = 121. Need to get from 121 to 82 using 4 and 83. 121 - 83 = 38. 38 + 4 = 42. 38 - 4 = 34.
58 - 63 is negative.
58 + 83 = 141. Need to get from 141 to 82 using 4 and 63. 141 - 63 = 78. 78 + 4 = 82. This works!

Let's check the numbers used: 58, 83, 63, 4. All used once.
Let's check the operators used: +, -, +. This uses '+' twice, which is allowed.

So, the equation is (58 + 83) - 63 + 4 = 82.
Let's verify:
58 + 83 = 141
141 - 63 = 78
78 + 4 = 82

This is another valid solution.

Let's try to find one using multiplication or division.
Consider (63 + 4) = 67. Need to get from 67 to 82 using 83 and 58. 83 - 58 = 25. 67 + 25 = 92. 67 - 25 = 42.
Consider (63 - 4) = 59. Need to get from 59 to 82 using 83 and 58. 83 - 58 = 25. 59 + 25 = 84. Close. 59 - 25 = 34.
Consider (63 * 4) = 252. Too big.
Consider (63 / 4) - not integer.

Consider (83 + 4) = 87. Need to get from 87 to 82 using 63 and 58. 87 - 63 = 24. 24 + 58 = 82. This works!

Let's check the numbers used: 83, 4, 63, 58. All used once.
Let's check the operators used: +, -, +. This uses '+' twice, which is allowed.

So, the equation is (83 + 4) - 63 + 58 = 82.
Let's verify:
83 + 4 = 87
87 - 63 = 24
24 + 58 = 82

This is a third valid solution.

Let's try to find one using multiplication.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C + D or (A * B) - C - D.
We saw that multiplying two numbers usually results in a number much larger than 82.
What if we multiply and then divide?
(63 * 4) = 252. Can we get 82 from 252, 83, 58?
252 - 83 = 169. 169 - 58 = 111.
252 - 58 = 194. 194 - 83 = 111.

What if we divide first?
We already established that direct division of any pair doesn't yield an integer.
So, division must be part of a larger expression that results in an integer.
For example, (A + B) / C.
(63 + 58) = 121. Not divisible by 4 or 83.
(83 + 58) = 141. Not divisible by 4 or 63.
(83 + 63) = 146. Not divisible by 4 or 58.

4943,1095,"<think>The target is 73. The numbers are 65, 34, 51, 93.
I need to combine these four numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to reach 73. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's look at the numbers and the target. 73 is a relatively small number compared to some of the given numbers (like 93). This suggests that subtraction or division might be important.

Possible starting points:
1.  Start with the largest number, 93, and subtract from it.
    93 - ? = 73. This means ? = 20. Can I make 20 from 65, 34, 51?
    65 - 34 - 51 = 31 - 51 = -20. This is close, but the sign is wrong.
    65 - 51 - 34 = 14 - 34 = -20. Same issue.
    What if I add some and subtract others?
    65 + 34 - 51 = 99 - 51 = 48 (not 20)
    65 + 51 - 34 = 116 - 34 = 82 (not 20)
    34 + 51 - 65 = 85 - 65 = 20. This works!
    So, 93 - (34 + 51 - 65) = 93 - (85 - 65) = 93 - 20 = 73.
    This uses all numbers: 93, 34, 51, 65.
    The equation is 93 - (34 + 51 - 65).

Let's check other possibilities to be sure.

2.  Start with 65.
    65 + ? = 73. This means ? = 8. Can I make 8 from 34, 51, 93?
    93 - 51 - 34 = 42 - 34 = 8. This works!
    So, 65 + (93 - 51 - 34) = 65 + (42 - 34) = 65 + 8 = 73.
    This uses all numbers: 65, 93, 51, 34.
    The equation is 65 + (93 - 51 - 34).

Both 93 - (34 + 51 - 65) and 65 + (93 - 51 - 34) are valid solutions. The problem asks for *an* equation. I will present the second one as it seems slightly simpler in structure.

Let's verify the second solution again:
Numbers: [65, 34, 51, 93]
Target: 73
Equation: 65 + (93 - 51 - 34)
Step 1: 93 - 51 = 42
Step 2: 42 - 34 = 8
Step 3: 65 + 8 = 73
All numbers (65, 93, 51, 34) are used exactly once. Only basic arithmetic operations are used. The target is achieved.

Let's verify the first solution again:
Numbers: [65, 34, 51, 93]
Target: 73
Equation: 93 - (34 + 51 - 65)
Step 1: 34 + 51 = 85
Step 2: 85 - 65 = 20
Step 3: 93 - 20 = 73
All numbers (93, 34, 51, 65) are used exactly once. Only basic arithmetic operations are used. The target is achieved.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 45.
- 45 + ? = 55. This would require 10. Can I get 10 from 38 and 28?
  - 38 - 28 = 10. Yes!
  - So, 45 + (38 - 28) = 45 + 10 = 55. This works.

Let's check if other combinations are possible, just to be thorough.

Possibility 2: Start with 38.
- 38 + ? = 55. This would require 17. Can I get 17 from 45 and 28?
  - 45 - 28 = 17. Yes!
  - So, 38 + (45 - 28) = 38 + 17 = 55. This also works.

Possibility 3: Start with 28.
- 28 + ? = 55. This would require 27. Can I get 27 from 45 and 38?
  - 45 - 38 = 7. No.
  - 38 - 45 = -7. No.
  - 45 + 38 = 83. No.
  - 45 * 38 is too large.
  - 45 / 38 is not an integer.
  - 38 / 45 is not an integer.

Let's try multiplication.
- 45 * ? = 55. Not likely with integers.
- 38 * ? = 55. Not likely.
- 28 * ? = 55. Not likely.

Let's try division.
- 45 / ? = 55. Not likely.
- 38 / ? = 55. Not likely.
- 28 / ? = 55. Not likely.

Let's try subtraction from a larger intermediate result.
- (45 + 38) - 28 = 83 - 28 = 55. This works.
- (45 + 28) - 38 = 73 - 38 = 35. No.
- (38 + 28) - 45 = 66 - 45 = 21. No.

- (45 * ?) - ? = 55.
- (38 * ?) - ? = 55.
- (28 * ?) - ? = 55.

1. 45 + (38 - 28) = 55
2. 38 + (45 - 28) = 55
3. (45 + 38) - 28 = 55

All three are valid. I will pick the first one as it seems straightforward.

36,782,"<think>The problem asks for a single mathematical equation using the numbers 23, 47, and 66 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 90.

Let the numbers be $a=23$, $b=47$, and $c=66$. We need to form an expression like $f(a, b, c) = 90$.

The available operations are +, -, *, /. We have three numbers, so we will need two operations. The order of operations matters, so we can use parentheses.

Let's list some possible structures for the equation:
1. $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c$
2. $a \text{ op1 } (b \text{ op2 } c)$

Let's try some combinations systematically.

**Attempt 1: Start with multiplication or division as it often leads to larger or smaller numbers quickly.**

Consider $(a * b) \text{ op2 } c$:
$(23 * 47) = 1081$.
$1081 + 66 = 1147$ (Too large)
$1081 - 66 = 1015$ (Too large)
$1081 / 66$ (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 90 easily)
$66 - 1081$ (Negative)

Consider $(a / b) \text{ op2 } c$:
$23 / 47$ (Fraction)
$(23 / 47) + 66$ (Fraction)
$(23 / 47) - 66$ (Fraction)
$66 - (23 / 47)$ (Fraction)

Consider $(b * c) \text{ op2 } a$:
$(47 * 66) = 3102$.
$3102 + 23 = 3125$ (Too large)
$3102 - 23 = 3079$ (Too large)
$23 - 3102$ (Negative)

Consider $(c * a) \text{ op2 } b$:
$(66 * 23) = 1518$.
$1518 + 47 = 1565$ (Too large)
$1518 - 47 = 1471$ (Too large)
$47 - 1518$ (Negative)

Consider $(b / c) \text{ op2 } a$:
$47 / 66$ (Fraction)

Consider $(c / b) \text{ op2 } a$:
$66 / 47$ (Fraction)

Consider $(a * c) \text{ op2 } b$:
$(23 * 66) = 1518$.
$1518 + 47 = 1565$
$1518 - 47 = 1471$

Consider $(a / c) \text{ op2 } b$:
$23 / 66$ (Fraction)

Consider $(c / a) \text{ op2 } b$:
$66 / 23$ (Fraction)

It seems direct multiplication of two numbers first leads to very large numbers. Let's try combinations where one number is subtracted or added to another before multiplication.

**Attempt 2: Try combinations like $(a \text{ op1 } b) * c$ or $a * (b \text{ op1 } c)$.**

Consider $(a + b) * c$:
$(23 + 47) * 66 = 70 * 66 = 4620$ (Too large)

Consider $(a - b) * c$:
$(23 - 47) * 66 = -24 * 66 = -1584$ (Negative)

Consider $(b - a) * c$:
$(47 - 23) * 66 = 24 * 66 = 1584$ (Too large)

Consider $(a + c) * b$:
$(23 + 66) * 47 = 89 * 47 = 4173$ (Too large)

Consider $(c - a) * b$:
$(66 - 23) * 47 = 43 * 47 = 2021$ (Too large)

Consider $(b + c) * a$:
$(47 + 66) * 23 = 113 * 23 = 2599$ (Too large)

Consider $(c - b) * a$:
$(66 - 47) * 23 = 19 * 23 = 437$ (Too large)

Consider $a * (b + c)$:
$23 * (47 + 66) = 23 * 113 = 2599$ (Too large)

Consider $a * (c - b)$:
$23 * (66 - 47) = 23 * 19 = 437$ (Too large)

Consider $b * (a + c)$:
$47 * (23 + 66) = 47 * 89 = 4173$ (Too large)

Consider $b * (c - a)$:
$47 * (66 - 23) = 47 * 43 = 2021$ (Too large)

Consider $c * (a + b)$:
$66 * (23 + 47) = 66 * 70 = 4620$ (Too large)

Consider $c * (b - a)$:
$66 * (47 - 23) = 66 * 24 = 1584$ (Too large)

The target is 90. This is a relatively small number compared to the products we are getting. This suggests that division might be involved in a way that reduces the magnitude, or that we are subtracting a large number from a slightly larger number.

Let's try to get close to 90.
$66 + 23 = 89$. This is very close to 90. We have 47 left.
Can we use 47 to turn 89 into 90?
$89 + 47$ (Too large)
$89 - 47 = 42$ (Not 90)
$47 - 89$ (Negative)
$89 * 47$ (Too large)
$89 / 47$ (Fraction)
$47 / 89$ (Fraction)

What if we use 47 and 23 to get something that, when combined with 66, gives 90?
$47 + 23 = 70$. $70 + 66 = 136$. $70 - 66 = 4$. $66 - 70 = -4$. $70 * 66$ (Too large). $70 / 66$ (Fraction). $66 / 70$ (Fraction).
$47 - 23 = 24$. $24 + 66 = 90$. This looks promising!
The expression is $(47 - 23) + 66$.
Let's check:
Numbers used: 47, 23, 66. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +. Allowed.
Result: $(47 - 23) + 66 = 24 + 66 = 90$.

This equation works. Let's write it out clearly.

The numbers are 23, 47, 66.
We want to reach 90.

Consider the combination of 47 and 23:
$47 - 23 = 24$.
Now we have the number 24 and the remaining number 66.
We need to combine 24 and 66 to get 90.
$24 + 66 = 90$.

So, the equation is $(47 - 23) + 66 = 90$.

Let's verify all conditions:
1. Uses numbers [23, 47, 66]: Yes, 47, 23, and 66 are used.
2. Each number used exactly once: Yes.
3. Uses only +, -, *, /: Yes, - and + are used.
4. Yields 90: Yes, $(47 - 23) + 66 = 24 + 66 = 90$.

This seems to be the correct solution.

Target: 92

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to reach 92. I should explore different combinations and orders of operations.

Initial thoughts:
- Multiplication often leads to larger numbers, which might be useful for reaching 92.
- Division can reduce numbers, which might be useful if intermediate results are too large.
- The numbers 33, 32, and 18 are relatively close to each other. The number 4 is smaller.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Start with multiplication.
(33 * 4) = 132. Now I have 132, 32, 18. Target is 92.
132 - 32 = 100. Now I have 100, 18. Target is 92.

39 - 32 = 7. No.
72 - 32 = 40. Used 32. Remaining: 33. Target: 92.
40 + 33 = 73. No.
40 - 33 = 7. No.

Attempt 5: Consider division.
Maybe divide a larger number by a smaller one.
32 / 4 = 8. Used 32, 4. Remaining: 33, 18. Target: 92.
8 + 33 = 41. Used 33. Remaining: 18. Target: 92.

- 62-27 = 35. Remaining numbers are 2 and 45. Can I get 6 from 2 and 45? 45/2 (not int), 45*2=90, 45+2=47, 45-2=43. No.

Let's try combining three numbers first.
- (62/2) + 27 = 31 + 27 = 58. Need to use 45 to get 41. 58 - 45 = 13. No.
- (62/2) - 27 = 31 - 27 = 4. Need to use 45. 4 + 45 = 49. No. 45 - 4 = 41. This looks promising!
So, (62/2) - 27 = 4. Then 45 - 4 = 41.
This means 45 - ((62/2) - 27) = 41.
Let's check the numbers used: 45, 62, 2, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations: -, /, -. All basic.

Let's verify the calculation:
62 / 2 = 31
31 - 27 = 4
45 - 4 = 41

This works.

Let's try another path to be sure.
What if I try to make 41 directly?
Maybe a large number minus something.
62 - X = 41 => X = 21. Can I make 21 from [27, 2, 45]?
27 - (45/?) No.
27 - 2 = 25. Need 45. 25 - 45 = -20. 45 - 25 = 20. No.
45 - 27 = 18. Need 2. 18 + 2 = 20. No. 18 - 2 = 16. No.
45 - 2 = 43. Need 27. 43 - 27 = 16. No.

What about multiplication?
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 41.
Or (A + B) * C - D = 41.

Let's revisit the 45 - ((62/2) - 27) = 41.
This is a valid solution.

Let's consider other possibilities just in case.
Try starting with 45.
45 - X = 41 => X = 4. Can I make 4 from [27, 2, 62]?
62/2 = 31. 31 - 27 = 4. Yes.
So, 45 - (62/2 - 27) = 41. This is the same solution.

Try starting with 27.
27 + X = 41 => X = 14. Can I make 14 from [2, 45, 62]?
62 - 45 = 17. Need 2. 17 - 2 = 15. No.
45 - 2 = 43. Need 62. 43 - 62 = -19. No.
62 / 2 = 31. Need 45. 31 - 45 = -14. So 27 + (31 - 45) = 27 - 14 = 13. No.
Wait, 27 + (31 - 45) = 27 + (-14) = 13.
But I need X = 14.
Can I make 14 from [2, 45, 62]?
62 - 45 = 17. 17 - 2 = 15.
45 - 2 = 43.
62 / 2 = 31.
Let's try 27 - X = 41 => X = -14. Can I make -14 from [2, 45, 62]?
62/2 = 31. 31 - 45 = -14. Yes.
So, 27 - (62/2 - 45) = 27 - (-14) = 27 + 14 = 41.
Let's check numbers: 27, 62, 2, 45. All used.
Operations: -, /, -. All basic.
Let's verify:
62 / 2 = 31
31 - 45 = -14
27 - (-14) = 27 + 14 = 41.
This is another valid solution.

Let's try starting with 2.
2 + X = 41 => X = 39. Can I make 39 from [27, 45, 62]?
62 - 27 = 35. Need 45. 35 + 45 = 80. 45 - 35 = 10. No.
45 - 27 = 18. Need 62. 62 - 18 = 44. No.

The user wants an equation that equals 35 using the numbers 41, 3, and 88.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Only the operations +, -, *, / are allowed.

Let's list the numbers: 41, 3, 88.
Target: 35.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations to get 35.
Let's try different combinations and see if any get close to 35.

Possible operations:
1. (41 op1 3) op2 88
2. (41 op1 88) op2 3
3. (3 op1 88) op2 41

Let's explore option 1: (41 op1 3) op2 88
- (41 + 3) + 88 = 44 + 88 = 132 (Too high)
- (41 + 3) - 88 = 44 - 88 = -44 (Too low)
- (41 + 3) * 88 = 44 * 88 (Too high)
- (41 + 3) / 88 = 44 / 88 = 0.5 (Too low)

- (41 - 3) + 88 = 38 + 88 = 126 (Too high)
- (41 - 3) - 88 = 38 - 88 = -50 (Too low)
- (41 - 3) * 88 = 38 * 88 (Too high)
- (41 - 3) / 88 = 38 / 88 (Too low)

- (41 * 3) + 88 = 123 + 88 = 211 (Too high)
- (41 * 3) - 88 = 123 - 88 = 35. This looks promising!
Let's check: 41 * 3 = 123. 123 - 88 = 35.
This uses 41, 3, and 88 exactly once and only uses * and -.

Let's verify the order of operations.
(41 * 3) - 88 = 123 - 88 = 35.
This works.

Let's explore other options just to be thorough, though I've found a solution.

Option 2: (41 op1 88) op2 3
- (41 + 88) + 3 = 129 + 3 = 132
- (41 + 88) - 3 = 129 - 3 = 126
- (41 - 88) + 3 = -47 + 3 = -44
- (41 - 88) - 3 = -47 - 3 = -50
- (41 * 88) ... (Too high)
- (41 / 88) ... (Too low)
- (88 - 41) + 3 = 47 + 3 = 50
- (88 - 41) - 3 = 47 - 3 = 44
- (88 / 41) ... (Not an integer, likely not useful)

Option 3: (3 op1 88) op2 41
- (3 + 88) + 41 = 91 + 41 = 132
- (3 + 88) - 41 = 91 - 41 = 50
- (88 - 3) + 41 = 85 + 41 = 126
- (88 - 3) - 41 = 85 - 41 = 44
- (88 * 3) ... (Too high)
- (88 / 3) ... (Not an integer)

The solution (41 * 3) - 88 = 35 is valid.
I need to present the reasoning and then the answer.
The reasoning is that I systematically tried combinations of the numbers with the allowed operations.
I started with (41 op1 3) op2 88.
I found that (41 * 3) resulted in 123.
Then, subtracting 88 from 123 gave 35.
This used all numbers once and only allowed operations.
The equation is (41 * 3) - 88.
Parentheses are implied by the order of operations, but it's good to be explicit.
The user asked for ""an equation"", so I should present it as `expression = 35`.
The expression is `(41 * 3) - 88`.
So the equation is `(41 * 3) - 88 = 35`.
The prompt asks for ""the final equation inside <answer></answer> tags"".
It doesn't explicitly say to include ""= 35"" in the answer tag, but it's standard for an equation. Let's assume it means the full equation.
The prompt says ""Generate an equation that equals 35"". This implies the full equation.

Let's re-read: ""First, outline your reasoning and the steps you took to arrive at the solution within <think></think> tags. Then, provide the final equation inside <answer></answer> tags.""
The equation is the expression that equals 35. So, `(41 * 3) - 88`.
If I put `(41 * 3) - 88 = 35` in the answer tag, it's an equation.
If I put just `(41 * 3) - 88` in the answer tag, it's an expression.
The prompt says ""Generate an equation"". So, `(41 * 3) - 88 = 35` is the most appropriate.

Let's consider if there are other valid solutions.
What if division was used?
(88 / ?) ...
(41 / ?) ...
(3 / ?) ...

Let's try to get a number close to 35 using two numbers, then adjust with the third.
- 41 - 3 = 38. Need to get -3 from 88. Not possible with +, -, *, /.
- 41 + 3 = 44. Need to get -9 from 88. Not possible.
- 88 / ?
- 88 - 41 = 47. Need to get -12 from 3. Not possible.
- 88 - 3 = 85. Need to get -50 from 41. Not possible.
- 41 * 3 = 123. Need to get -88 from 123. Yes, 123 - 88 = 35. This is the solution found.

Consider division leading to an integer.
88 / 4 = 22 (but 4 is not available)
88 / 8 = 11 (but 8 is not available)
88 / 11 = 8 (but 11 is not available)
88 / 22 = 4 (but 22 is not available)
88 / 44 = 2 (but 44 is not available)

41 / ?
3 / ?

It seems the multiplication and subtraction route is the most straightforward and likely the intended solution.
The reasoning is clear: explore combinations, find one that works.
The steps:
1. List numbers and target.
2. Try combinations of two numbers with an operation.
3. Combine the result with the third number using another operation.
4. Check if the result equals the target.
5. Found (41 * 3) = 123.
6. Found 123 - 88 = 35.
7. Confirmed all numbers used once, only allowed operations used.

The equation is (41 * 3) - 88 = 35.
The prompt asks for ""the final equation"".
I will put the full equation in the answer tag.
The reasoning should be concise.
""I explored combinations of the given numbers (41, 3, 88) using the allowed operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value of 35. By multiplying 41 by 3, I obtained 123. Subtracting 88 from 123 resulted in 35, using each number exactly once.""
This seems like a good summary of the reasoning.
The final equation is (41 * 3) - 88 = 35.
I will ensure no extra text is present.
The prompt is very strict about ""No other text",0.0,Answer content is empty.

18. 52 / 15 - 60 = 3.46... - 60 (Not 56)

Let's check the order of operations for 60 / 15 + 52.
Division first: 60 / 15 = 4.
Then addition: 4 + 52 = 56.

This equation uses 15, 60, and 52 exactly once. It uses division and addition. The result is 56.

Verification:
Numbers used: 15, 60, 52 (each once)
Operators used: /, +
Result: 56
Equation: 60 / 15 + 52

Step 1: 60 / 15 = 4

Let's try to combine the numbers.
I have a large number (94) and a number close to it (61).
Maybe I can subtract something from 94 or 61.
Or maybe I can add some numbers to get close to 50.

Let's try to get close to 50 using two numbers first.
61 - 21 = 40. Then I have 4 and 94 left. Can I get 10 from 4 and 94? No, not easily.
94 - 61 = 33. Then I have 4 and 21 left. Can I get 17 from 4 and 21? 21 - 4 = 17. So, (94 - 61) + (21 - 4) = 33 + 17 = 50. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 94, 61, 21, 4. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +, -. Basic operations.
Result: (94 - 61) + (21 - 4) = 33 + 17 = 50. Target achieved.

Another approach:

If I divide 61 by something, it won't be an integer.
If I multiply 4 by something, it might get too big or too small.

Let's go back to the subtraction idea.
(94 - 61) + (21 - 4) = 50. This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there are other possibilities.
What if I try to make 50 directly?
Maybe 4 * X = 50? X = 12.5. Not easy to get from 61, 94, 21.
Maybe 21 * X = 50? No.
Maybe 61 - X = 50? X = 11. Can I get 11 from 4, 94, 21? 21 - (94/?) No.
Maybe 94 - X = 50? X = 44. Can I get 44 from 61, 4, 21? 61 - 21 + 4 = 40 + 4 = 44.
So, 94 - (61 - 21 + 4) = 94 - (40 + 4) = 94 - 44 = 50.
Let's verify this one:
Numbers used: 94, 61, 21, 4. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -, +, +. Basic operations.
Result: 94 - (61 - 21 + 4) = 94 - (40 + 4) = 94 - 44 = 50. Target achieved.

Both (94 - 61) + (21 - 4) and 94 - (61 - 21 + 4) are valid. I will present the first one as it seems slightly simpler.

Let's list the numbers: [15, 60, 52]
Target: 56

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the four basic ones. This gives a large number of combinations, but I can try to be systematic.

Let's consider the order of operations. Parentheses can be used implicitly by the order of operations or explicitly.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try different combinations.

Attempt 1: Start with the largest number, 60.
Maybe 60 is involved in a subtraction to get closer to 56.
60 - ? = 56. This would require 4. Can I make 4 from 15 and 52?
15 + 52 = 67 (too big)
52 - 15 = 37 (too big)
15 * 52 (too big)
52 / 15 (not an integer)
15 / 52 (not an integer)
So, 60 - (something) = 56 doesn't seem to work directly.

What if 60 is added or multiplied?
If 60 is added, the other two numbers must sum to 56 - 60 = -4. This is impossible with positive numbers.
If 60 is multiplied, the result will be very large.

Let's try using 52.
Maybe 52 + ? = 56. This requires 4. Can I make 4 from 15 and 60?
60 - 15 = 45 (too big)
60 / 15 = 4. Yes!
So, 52 + (60 / 15) = 52 + 4 = 56.
This uses 52, 60, and 15 exactly once.
The operations are + and /.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's verify the structure: a op1 (b op2 c)
Here, a = 52, op1 = +, b = 60, op2 = /, c = 15.
52 + (60 / 15) = 52 + 4 = 56.

1159,280,"<think>The problem asks us to find an equation using the numbers 64, 67, 48, and 69 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 39.

Let's list the numbers: N = {64, 67, 48, 69}.
The target is T = 39.
Allowed operations: O = {+, -, *, /}.

We need to combine these four numbers using three operations. The order of operations matters, so we'll need to consider parentheses.

Let's start by trying some simple combinations and see if we can get close to 39.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 (c op3 d)
2. ((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d
3. (a op1 (b op2 c)) op3 d
4. a op1 ((b op2 c) op3 d)
5. a op1 (b op2 (c op3 d))

Let's try to get a number close to 39 by combining two numbers first.

The differences seem more promising as they are smaller.
We have 3, -3, 16, -16, 5, -5, 19, -19, 2, -2, 21, -21.

Let's consider the target 39.
Can we get 39 by adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing two numbers from the set? No, we need to use all four.

Let's try to get a number close to 39 using three numbers and then adjust with the fourth.

Consider the largest numbers first: 69, 67, 64, 48.
Maybe a large number minus something?
69 - X = 39 => X = 30. Can we make 30 from {64, 67, 48}?
67 - 48 = 19. Not 30.
64 - 48 = 16. Not 30.
67 - 64 = 3. Not 30.

64 * 69 = 4416
67 * 48 = 3216
67 * 69 = 4623
48 * 69 = 3312

These are all very large. To get 39, we would likely need to divide by a large number or subtract a large number.

Let's try division.
64 / 48 = 4/3
64 / 67
64 / 69
67 / 48
67 / 64

48 / 64 = 3/4

Fractions might be involved.

Let's try to get a number close to 39 by combining two numbers, and then use the other two.
Example: (64 op1 67) op2 (48 op3 69)

Let's try to get a number around 39 by combining three numbers.
Try using 69 and 48. 69 - 48 = 21. We need to get 39 from {64, 67} and 21.

115 - 64 = 51
115 - 69 = 46
115 + 64 = 179
115 + 69 = 184

Let's consider the structure ((a op1 b) op2 c) op3 d.
Let's try to make a number close to 39 using the first three numbers.
(64 + 67) - 48 = 131 - 48 = 83. Then 83 op3 69. 83 - 69 = 14. 83 + 69 = 152.
(64 - 67) + 48 = -3 + 48 = 45. Then 45 op3 69. 45 - 69 = -24. 45 + 69 = 114.
(67 - 64) + 48 = 3 + 48 = 51. Then 51 op3 69. 51 - 69 = -18. 51 + 69 = 120.
(64 * 67) - 48 = large.

Let's try to get a number that, when combined with the fourth number, gives 39.
Suppose the last operation is subtraction: X - Y = 39.
Or addition: X + Y = 39.
Or multiplication: X * Y = 39. (Unlikely with these numbers)
Or division: X / Y = 39.

Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 39 and subtract something.
Or a number slightly smaller than 39 and add something.

Consider the numbers again: 64, 67, 48, 69.
Notice that 64 and 48 are multiples of 16. 64 = 4 * 16, 48 = 3 * 16.
64 / 48 = 4/3.

Let's try to use division to reduce the numbers.
If we divide 64 by 48, we get 4/3.
Can we combine 4/3 with 67 and 69 to get 39?

5054,689,"<think>The numbers available are [66, 44, 90, 4] and the target is 20. I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's analyze the numbers and the target. The numbers are relatively large, especially 66, 44, and 90. The target, 20, is much smaller. This suggests that division or subtraction will likely be important to reduce the magnitude of the numbers.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create smaller intermediate numbers that can then be combined.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers close to 20 or multiples/factors of numbers that can lead to 20.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Focus on division to reduce large numbers.
- 66 / 44 is not an integer.
- 90 / 4 is not an integer.
- 66 / ?
- 44 / ?

Possible ways to get 20:
- 10 * 2
- 40 / 2
- 25 - 5
- 15 + 5
- 30 - 10

Let's see if we can form any of these intermediate numbers.

Consider 44 / 4 = 11. We are left with [66, 90] and need to get 20 from 11 and these numbers.
- 11 + 66 + 90 = 167
- 11 - 66 + 90 = 35
- 11 + 66 - 90 = -13

Let's try combining 90 and 4.
- 90 - 4 = 86. Left with [66, 44]. Need 20 from 86, 66, 44.
  - 86 - 66 + 44 = 64
  - 86 + 66 - 44 = 108

56 / 44 is not an integer. 44 / 56 is not an integer. 56 - 44 = 12. 56 + 44 = 100. 56 * 44 is too large.
So, (75 - 60) * (something from 44, 56) doesn't seem to work easily.

Attempt 2:
Let's try division first.
75 / ?
60 / ?
56 / ?
44 / ?

Consider the target 45. It's divisible by 3, 5, 9, 15.

Let's try to create 15 or 9 or 5.
We already saw 75 - 60 = 15.
Can we get 3 from 44 and 56? No.

What if we try to get 9?
75 - 60 = 15.
56 - 44 = 12.
56 + 44 = 100.
56 * 44 = large.
56 / 44 = not integer.
44 / 56 = not integer.

Let's try combining numbers differently.
Maybe a large number minus something.
75 - (something from 60, 44, 56) = 45.
This means (something from 60, 44, 56) = 75 - 45 = 30.
Can I get 30 from 60, 44, 56?
60 - (56 - 44) = 60 - 12 = 48. No.
60 - (56 + 44) = 60 - 100 = -40. No.
60 - (56 / 44) = not integer.
60 - (44 / 56) = not integer.
60 - (56 * 44) = too small.
(60 + 44) - 56 = 104 - 56 = 48. No.
(60 + 56) - 44 = 116 - 44 = 72. No.
(60 - 44) + 56 = 16 + 56 = 72. No.
(60 - 56) + 44 = 4 + 44 = 48. No.
60 / (something from 44, 56) = 30?
60 / 2 = 30. Can I get 2 from 44 and 56?
56 / 44 = not integer. 44 / 56 = not integer. 56 - 44 = 12. 56 + 44 = 100. 56 * 44 = large.
So, 60 / (something from 44, 56) = 30 doesn't seem to work.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe a division that results in a number close to 45.
75 / ?
60 / ?
56 / ?
44 / ?

What if we try to make 90 and divide by 2?
Can we make 90 from three numbers?
75 + 60 - 44 = 135 - 44 = 91. Close.
75 + 60 - 56 = 135 - 56 = 79.
75 + 44 - 60 = 119 - 60 = 59.
75 + 56 - 60 = 131 - 60 = 71.
60 + 44 + 56 = 160.

Let's consider the structure (A op B) op (C op D).
Or A op (B op (C op D)).

Let's try to get 45 by multiplying two numbers.
Possible factors of 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.
Can we make 5 and 9?
From [60, 44, 56, 75].
Can we make 5?
75 / 15 = 5. Can we make 15 from 60, 44, 56?
60 - 44 - ?
60 - 44 = 16. Need 1. No.
60 - 56 = 4. Need 11. No.
44 - ?
56 - ?

Let's try to make 9.
Can we make 9 from two numbers?
75 / ?
60 / ?
56 / ?
44 / ?

Let's try to make 15.
75 - 60 = 15.
Now we need to use 44 and 56 to get 3, so that 15 * 3 = 45.
Can we get 3 from 44 and 56? No.

What if we try to make 5?
Can we make 5 from two numbers?
75 / 15 = 5. Can we make 15 from 60, 44, 56? No.
60 / 12 = 5. Can we make 12 from 44, 56, 75?
56 - 44 = 12. Yes!
So, we have 60 / (56 - 44) = 60 / 12 = 5.
Now we need to use 75 and the result 5 to get 45.
We have 5 and 75. We need to get 45.
5 * 9 = 45. Can we make 9 from 75? No.
75 - 30 = 45. Can we make 30 from 5? No.
75 / ?

Let's re-evaluate:
We used 60, 56, 44 to get 5: 60 / (56 - 44) = 5.
We have the number 75 left.
We need to combine 5 and 75 to get 45.
This means the equation must be structured like:
(60 / (56 - 44)) op 75 = 45
or
75 op (60 / (56 - 44)) = 45

Let's test the operations:
5 + 75 = 80. No.
5 - 75 = -70. No.
75 - 5 = 70. No.
5 * 75 = 375. No.
5 / 75 = not integer. No.
75 / 5 = 15. No.

This path didn't work.

Let's try to make 9.
Can we make 9 from two numbers?
75 / ?
60 / ?
56 / ?
44 / ?

Let's try to make 15.
75 - 60 = 15.
We need to use 44 and 56 to get 3. No.

Let's try to make 3.
Can we make 3 from two numbers?
60 / 20 = 3. Can we make 20 from 44, 56, 75?

1823,408,"<think>The user wants me to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers 2, 26, and 38, exactly once each, to reach the target number 90. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: [2, 26, 38]
Target: 90

I need to try different combinations and operations.

**Attempt 1: Start with multiplication**
Maybe multiply the two larger numbers and then adjust with the smaller one.
38 * 26 = 988. This is way too big.
38 * 2 = 76. Now I need to get from 76 to 90 using 26. 90 - 76 = 14. Can I get 14 from 26? No, not directly. Can I use 26 with 76 to get 90? 76 + 26 = 102 (too big). 76 - 26 = 50 (too small). 26 - 76 is negative. 76 / 26 is not an integer.

26 * 2 = 52. Now I need to get from 52 to 90 using 38. 90 - 52 = 38. Yes! I can add 38.
So, (26 * 2) + 38 = 52 + 38 = 90.
This uses all numbers (2, 26, 38) exactly once and reaches the target 90.

Let's double-check the rules:
- Use numbers [2 26 38]: Yes.
- Precisely reach target 90: Yes.
- Use +, -, *, /: Yes, I used * and +.
- Every number used once: Yes.

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, though I've found a solution.

**Attempt 2: Start with addition/subtraction**
26 + 38 = 64. Need to get to 90 using 2. 90 - 64 = 26. Can I get 26 from 2? No. Can I use 2 with 64 to get 90? 64 + 2 = 66 (too small). 64 - 2 = 62 (too small). 64 * 2 = 128 (too big). 64 / 2 = 32 (too small).

**Attempt 3: Division**
38 / 2 = 19. Need to get to 90 using 26. 90 - 19 = 71. Can I get 71 from 26? No. Can I use 26 with 19 to get 90? 19 + 26 = 45. 19 - 26 = -7. 19 * 26 = 494.

26 / 2 = 13. Need to get to 90 using 38. 90 - 13 = 77. Can I get 77 from 38? No. Can I use 38 with 13 to get 90? 13 + 38 = 51. 13 - 38 = -25. 13 * 38 = 494.

(26 + 38) * 2 = 64 * 2 = 128 (too big)
(26 + 2) * 38 = 28 * 38 = 1064 (too big)
(38 + 2) * 26 = 40 * 26 = 1040 (too big)

1685,364,"<think>The target number is 18. The available numbers are 45, 3, and 21. I need to use each number exactly once with standard arithmetic operations.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Addition/Subtraction:**

2.  **Multiplication/Division:**

        *   7 * 45 = 315 (Too high)
        *   45 / 7 (not an integer)

The combination that worked was (3 * 21) - 45 = 18.
Let's verify:
3 * 21 = 63
63 - 45 = 18.
All numbers (45, 3, 21) are used exactly once. Standard operations are used. The result is 18.

Another possibility: 45 - (21 + 3) = 45 - 24 = 21 (No)
Another possibility: 45 - (21 - 3) = 45 - 18 = 27 (No)
Another possibility: 45 - (3 * 21) = 45 - 63 = -18 (No)
Another possibility: (45 / 3) + 21 = 15 + 21 = 36 (No)
Another possibility: (45 / 3) - 21 = 15 - 21 = -6 (No)
Another possibility: 21 + (45 / 3) = 21 + 15 = 36 (No)
Another possibility: 21 - (45 / 3) = 21 - 15 = 6 (No)
Another possibility: 3 * (45 / 21) - not integer
Another possibility: 21 * (45 / 3) = 21 * 15 = 315 (No)
Another possibility: 3 + (45 - 21) = 3 + 24 = 27 (No)
Another possibility: 3 - (45 - 21) = 3 - 24 = -21 (No)
Another possibility: 21 + (45 - 3) = 21 + 42 = 63 (No)
Another possibility: 21 - (45 - 3) = 21 - 42 = -21 (No)

The solution (3 * 21) - 45 = 18 seems to be the most straightforward.
Let's check if there are other ways to write it.
Is 21 * 3 - 45 also valid? Yes, multiplication is commutative.
Is -45 + (3 * 21) valid? Yes, addition is commutative.

5235,1811,"<think>The target is 73. The numbers are 14, 60, 38, 49.
I need to combine these four numbers using +, -, *, / to get 73.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite spread out. 60 is the largest.
If I add 60 to something, I need to get 13.
Can I get 13 from 14, 38, 49?
49 - 38 = 11. 11 + 14 = 25. Not 13.
49 - 14 = 35. 35 - 38 is negative.
38 - 14 = 24. 49 - 24 = 25. Not 13.
14 + 38 = 52. 49 - 52 is negative.
14 + 49 = 63. 38 - 63 is negative.
38 + 49 = 87. 14 - 87 is negative.

What if I subtract from 60? I need to get 73, so this is unlikely unless I subtract a negative number.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe 14 * something?
14 * 5 = 70. Need 3 more. Can I get 3 from 60, 38, 49?
49 - 38 = 11. 60 - 11 = 49. No.
60 / ? No easy division.

Let's try combining two numbers first.
49 + 14 = 63. Remaining: 60, 38. Target: 73. Need 10.
Can I get 10 from 60 and 38? 60 - 38 = 22. 60 + 38 = 98. 60/38 not integer. 38/60 not integer.

49 - 14 = 35. Remaining: 60, 38. Target: 73. Need 38.
Can I get 38 from 60 and 38? Yes, 38. But I need to use 60.
So, (49 - 14) + 38 = 35 + 38 = 73. This uses 49, 14, 38. I still need to use 60.
How can I incorporate 60 without changing the result? Multiply by 1.
Can I make 1 from 60? No, not easily with the remaining numbers.

60 + 14 = 74. Remaining: 38, 49. Target: 73. Need -1.
Can I get -1 from 38 and 49? 38 - 49 = -11. 49 - 38 = 11. No.

60 - 14 = 46. Remaining: 38, 49. Target: 73. Need 27.
Can I get 27 from 38 and 49? 49 - 38 = 11. 38 - 49 = -11. No.

60 + 38 = 98. Remaining: 14, 49. Target: 73. Need -25.
Can I get -25 from 14 and 49? 14 - 49 = -35. 49 - 14 = 35. No.

60 - 38 = 22. Remaining: 14, 49. Target: 73. Need 51.
Can I get 51 from 14 and 49? 14 + 49 = 63. 49 - 14 = 35. No.

60 + 49 = 109. Remaining: 14, 38. Target: 73. Need -36.
Can I get -36 from 14 and 38? 14 - 38 = -24. 38 - 14 = 24. No.

60 - 49 = 11. Remaining: 14, 38. Target: 73. Need 62.
Can I get 62 from 14 and 38? 14 + 38 = 52. No.

Let's try division.
60 / 14 (not integer)
60 / 38 (not integer)
60 / 49 (not integer)
38 / 14 (not integer)
38 / 49 (not integer)

49 / 60 (not integer)

What if I use multiplication with one of the smaller numbers?
14 * 6 = 84. Need -11. Can I get -11 from 38, 49, 60?
49 - 60 = -11. So, 14 * 6 + (49 - 60) = 84 - 11 = 73.
But I don't have 6. I have 14, 60, 38, 49.

Let's try to get a number close to 73.
49 + 38 = 87. Remaining: 14, 60. Target: 73. Need -14.
Can I get -14 from 14 and 60? 14 - 60 = -46. 60 - 14 = 46. No.

Let's try 49 + 14 = 63. Remaining: 60, 38. Target: 73. Need 10.
Can I get 10 from 60 and 38? No.

Let's try 60 + 14 = 74. Remaining: 38, 49. Target: 73. Need -1.
Can I get -1 from 38 and 49? No.

Let's try 60 - 14 = 46. Remaining: 38, 49. Target: 73. Need 27.
Can I get 27 from 38 and 49? No.

Let's try 49 - 38 = 11. Remaining: 14, 60. Target: 73. Need 62.
Can I get 62 from 14 and 60? 14 + 60 = 74. No.

Let's try 38 - 14 = 24. Remaining: 60, 49. Target: 73. Need 49.
Can I get 49 from 60 and 49? Yes, 49. But I need to use 60.
So, (38 - 14) + 49 = 24 + 49 = 73. This uses 38, 14, 49. I still need to use 60.
How can I incorporate 60 without changing the result? Multiply by 1.
Can I make 1 from 60? No.

Let's try a different structure.
Maybe (A + B) - (C + D) or (A * B) + (C * D) etc.

Consider 60.
If I do 60 + something, I need 13.
Can I get 13 from 14, 38, 49?
(49 - 38) + 14 = 11 + 14 = 25.
(38 - 14) + 49 = 24 + 49 = 73.
(49 + 14) - 38 = 63 - 38 = 25.
(38 + 14) - 49 = 52 - 49 = 3.

Let's try 60 - something. I need 73, so I need to subtract a negative number.
60 - (-13). Can I get -13 from 14, 38, 49?
14 - (49 - 38) = 14 - 11 = 3.

The problem requires me to find a mathematical expression that evaluates to 92 using the numbers 33, 2, 97, and 60 exactly once, with the allowed operations being addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: [33, 2, 97, 60].
The target is 92.

I need to try different combinations of these numbers and operations.

Let's start by trying to combine two numbers and then incorporate the others.

Possible pairs and their combinations:
33 + 2 = 35
33 - 2 = 31
33 * 2 = 66
33 / 2 = 16.5 (not an integer, might be tricky)

33 + 97 = 130
33 - 97 = -64
33 * 97 = 3201
97 / 33 (not integer)

33 + 60 = 93
33 - 60 = -27
33 * 60 = 1980
60 / 33 (not integer)

2 + 97 = 99
2 - 97 = -95
2 * 97 = 194
97 / 2 = 48.5

2 + 60 = 62
2 - 60 = -58
2 * 60 = 120
60 / 2 = 30

97 + 60 = 157
97 - 60 = 37
97 * 60 = 5820
60 / 97 (not integer)

Let's try to get close to 92.
We have 97. If we subtract something small, we might get close.
97 - ? = 92. So ? = 5.
Can we make 5 from [33, 2, 60]?
33 - 60 / 2 = 33 - 30 = 3. Not 5.
60 / (33 - 2) = 60 / 31 (not integer)
(60 - 33) / 2 = 27 / 2 (not integer)
(60 + 2) / 33 = 62 / 33 (not integer)
(33 + 2) - 60 = 35 - 60 = -25
60 - (33 + 2) = 60 - 35 = 25
60 / 2 - 33 = 30 - 33 = -3
33 - 60 / 2 = 33 - 30 = 3

Let's try starting with 60.
60 + ? = 92. So ? = 32.
Can we make 32 from [33, 2, 97]?
97 - 33 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62. Not 32.
97 - (33 + 2) = 97 - 35 = 62. Not 32.
33 * 2 - 97 = 66 - 97 = -31. Not 32.
97 - 33 * 2 = 97 - 66 = 31. Close, but not 32.
(97 - 33) / 2 = 64 / 2 = 32. Yes!
So, we can have 60 + (97 - 33) / 2.
Let's check the numbers used: 60, 97, 33, 2. All used exactly once.
Let's check the calculation: 60 + (97 - 33) / 2 = 60 + 64 / 2 = 60 + 32 = 92.
This works.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
Maybe multiplication is involved to get a larger number and then subtract.
33 * 2 = 66. Remaining: [97, 60].
66 + 97 - 60 = 163 - 60 = 103.
66 + 60 - 97 = 126 - 97 = 29.
66 * 97 (too big)
66 * 60 (too big)

33 * ?
Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 92 and subtract.
Maybe 120? 2 * 60 = 120. Remaining: [33, 97].
120 - 33 + 97 = 87 + 97 = 184.
120 - 97 + 33 = 23 + 33 = 56.
120 - (97 - 33) = 120 - 64 = 56.
120 - (97 + 33) = 120 - 130 = -10.

Let's try 97.
97 + ? = 92. ? = -5.
Can we make -5 from [33, 2, 60]?
2 - 60 / 33 (not integer)
2 - (60 - 33) = 2 - 27 = -25.
(2 - 60) / 33 = -58 / 33 (not integer)
33 - 60 / 2 = 33 - 30 = 3.
2 - 33 + 60 = -31 + 60 = 29.
33 - 2 - 60 = 31 - 60 = -29.

Let's try division.
Maybe something divided by 2? Target is 92, so numerator should be 184.
Can we make 184 from [33, 97, 60]?
33 * 60 = 1980 (too big)
33 * 97 (too big)
97 + 60 + 33 = 190. Close.
97 * 2 = 194. Remaining [33, 60].
194 - 33 + 60 = 161 + 60 = 221.
194 - 60 + 33 = 134 + 33 = 167.
194 - (60 - 33) = 194 - 27 = 167.
194 - (60 + 33) = 194 - 93 = 101.

Let's re-evaluate the first successful attempt: 60 + (97 - 33) / 2.
Numbers used: 60, 97, 33, 2. All used once.
Operations: +, -, /. Allowed.
Calculation: 60 + (64) / 2 = 60 + 32 = 92. Correct.

Let's try to find another one just to be sure.
Consider 33.
33 * 2 = 66. Remaining [97, 60].
We need 92. We have 66. Need 92 - 66 = 26.
Can we make 26 from [97, 60]?
97 - 60 = 37. No.
60 - 97 = -37. No.

Consider 33 * 3 = 99 (not allowed to use 3).

Let's try to use 97 and 60 first.
97 - 60 = 37. Remaining [33, 2].
37 + 33 * 2 = 37 + 66 = 103.
37 * 2 + 33 = 74 + 33 = 107.
37 + 33 - 2 = 70 - 2 = 68.

37 * (33 - 2) = 37 * 31 (too big)
37 * (33 + 2) = 37 * 35 (too big)

97 + 60 = 157. Remaining [33, 2].

1491,1213,"<think>The problem asks for an equation using the numbers 30, 61, and 66 exactly once, with the result being 97. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations to get 97. Let's list the numbers: 30, 61, 66. The target is 97.

I can try different combinations and orders of operations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
66 + 61 = 127. Then I need to use 30 to get 97. 127 - 30 = 97. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 66, 61, 30. All used exactly once.
Operations used: Addition, Subtraction. Allowed.
Result: 97. Correct.

So, the equation is 66 + 61 - 30 = 97.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, although I've already found a solution.

Possibility 2: Multiplication.
If I multiply any two numbers, the result will be quite large.
30 * 61 = 1830. Using 66 to get 97 from 1830 is unlikely with simple operations.
30 * 66 = 1980.
61 * 66 = 4026.

Possibility 3: Division.
Division might lead to non-integer results unless carefully planned.
66 / 30 is not an integer.
61 / 30 is not an integer.
66 / 61 is not an integer.
30 / 61 is not an integer.
30 / 66 is not an integer.
61 / 66 is not an integer.

Let's try combining operations.
What if I subtract first?
61 - 30 = 31. Then use 66. 31 + 66 = 97. This also works!
Numbers used: 61, 30, 66. All used exactly once.
Operations used: Subtraction, Addition. Allowed.
Result: 97. Correct.
So, the equation is 61 - 30 + 66 = 97.

What if I subtract in a different order?
66 - 30 = 36. Then use 61. 36 + 61 = 97. This also works!
Numbers used: 66, 30, 61. All used exactly once.
Operations used: Subtraction, Addition. Allowed.
Result: 97. Correct.
So, the equation is 66 - 30 + 61 = 97.

What if I subtract 61 from 66?
66 - 61 = 5. Then use 30. 5 + 30 = 35. Not 97.
66 - 61 = 5. Then use 30. 30 - 5 = 25. Not 97.
66 - 61 = 5. Then use 30. 5 * 30 = 150. Not 97.
66 - 61 = 5. Then use 30. 30 / 5 = 6. Not 97.

What if I subtract 30 from 61?
61 - 30 = 31. Then use 66. 31 + 66 = 97. (Already found)

What if I subtract 66 from 61?
61 - 66 = -5. Then use 30. -5 + 30 = 25. Not 97.
61 - 66 = -5. Then use 30. 30 - (-5) = 35. Not 97.
61 - 66 = -5. Then use 30. -5 * 30 = -150. Not 97.
61 - 66 = -5. Then use 30. 30 / -5 = -6. Not 97.

Let's go back to the first solution found: 66 + 61 - 30 = 97. This is a valid solution.
The order of operations matters if parentheses are involved, but without them, addition and subtraction are performed from left to right.
66 + 61 = 127
127 - 30 = 97.

Another valid solution found was 61 - 30 + 66 = 97.
61 - 30 = 31
31 + 66 = 97.

Another valid solution found was 66 - 30 + 61 = 97.
66 - 30 = 36
36 + 61 = 97.

4226,1947,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 31, 80, 47, and 4 exactly once, along with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to arrive at the target number 68.

I need to explore various combinations and order of operations. Let's list the numbers: N = {31, 80, 47, 4}. Target = 68.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create intermediate numbers that are close to the target or can easily lead to the target.
3. Consider the order of operations (parentheses might be implicitly needed if not explicitly stated, but the problem implies a single expression).

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.
- 80 * 4 = 320. This is too large. How to reduce it using 31 and 47?
  - 320 - 31 - 47 = 320 - 78 = 242 (Too large)
  - 320 - 47 - 31 = 242 (Same)
  - 320 + 31 + 47 = 398 (Too large)
  - 320 - (31 + 47) = 242 (Same)
  - 320 / 47? Not an integer.
  - 320 / 31? Not an integer.

- 80 * 31 = 2480. Way too large.
- 47 * 4 = 188.
  - 188 - 80 - 31 = 188 - 111 = 77 (Close, but not 68)
  - 188 - 31 - 80 = 77 (Same)
  - 188 + 80 + 31 = 299 (Too large)
  - 188 - (80 + 31) = 77 (Same)
  - 188 - 80 + 31 = 108 + 31 = 139 (Too large)
  - 188 + 80 - 31 = 268 - 31 = 237 (Too large)
  - 188 - 31 + 80 = 157 + 80 = 237 (Same)

- 47 * 31 = 1457. Too large.

Attempt 2: Using division.
- 80 / 4 = 20.
  - Now use 31 and 47 to get 68 from 20.
  - 20 + 31 + 47 = 51 + 47 = 98 (Too large)
  - 20 + 47 + 31 = 98 (Same)
  - 20 + 47 - 31 = 67 - 31 = 36 (Too small)
  - 20 + 31 - 47 = 51 - 47 = 4 (Too small)
  - 20 - 31 + 47 = -11 + 47 = 36 (Too small)
  - 20 - 47 + 31 = -27 + 31 = 4 (Too small)
  - 20 * 31 = 620. Too large.
  - 20 * 47 = 940. Too large.
  - 20 + (47 - 31) = 20 + 16 = 36 (Too small)
  - 20 + (31 - 47) = 20 - 16 = 4 (Too small)
  - (20 + 47) - 31 = 67 - 31 = 36 (Too small)
  - (20 + 31) - 47 = 51 - 47 = 4 (Too small)
  - (47 - 31) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36 (Too small)
  - (31 - 47) + 20 = -16 + 20 = 4 (Too small)

- 80 / 31? Not an integer.
- 47 / 4? Not an integer.
- 31 / 4? Not an integer.
- 4 / 31? Not an integer.
- 4 / 47? Not an integer.
- 4 / 80? Not an integer.

Attempt 3: Combining operations.
Let's try to get close to 68.
- 80 - 4 = 76.
  - Now use 31 and 47.
  - 76 - 31 + 47 = 45 + 47 = 92 (Too large)
  - 76 + 31 - 47 = 107 - 47 = 60 (Close!)
  - 76 - 47 + 31 = 29 + 31 = 60 (Same)
  - 76 + 47 - 31 = 123 - 31 = 92 (Too large)
  - 76 - (47 - 31) = 76 - 16 = 60 (Same)
  - 76 - (31 - 47) = 76 - (-16) = 92 (Too large)
  - 76 + (47 - 31) = 76 + 16 = 92 (Too large)
  - 76 + (31 - 47) = 76 - 16 = 60 (Same)

So, (80 - 4) + 31 - 47 = 60. Not 68.
And (80 - 4) - 47 + 31 = 60. Not 68.

Let's re-examine 76 + 31 - 47 = 60. We need to increase the result by 8.
The numbers are 80, 4, 31, 47.
The expression is (80 - 4) + 31 - 47.

What if we change the order of operations for the last two numbers?
(80 - 4) - (47 - 31) = 76 - 16 = 60.
(80 - 4) + (31 - 47) = 76 + (-16) = 60.

Let's try another starting point.
- 80 + 4 = 84.
  - Use 31 and 47.
  - 84 - 31 - 47 = 84 - 78 = 6 (Too small)
  - 84 - 47 - 31 = 6 (Same)
  - 84 + 31 - 47 = 115 - 47 = 68. Found it!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 80, 4, 31, 47. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, -. All fundamental.
Result: 68.

The expression is 80 + 4 - 31 - 47.
Let's check the order of operations.
80 + 4 = 84
84 - 31 = 53
53 - 47 = 6. This is not 68.

My calculation was wrong.
84 + 31 - 47 = 115 - 47 = 68. This is correct.
So the expression is (80 + 4) + 31 - 47.
Let's check if this is a valid single expression without explicit parentheses if the order of operations is followed.
80 + 4 - 31 - 47
Addition and subtraction have the same precedence, so they are evaluated from left to right.
80 + 4 = 84
84 - 31 = 53
53 - 47 = 6.

So, the expression needs parentheses to enforce the order.
(80 + 4) + 31 - 47 = 84 + 31 - 47 = 115 - 47 = 68. This works.
The numbers are 80,",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
2704,668,"<think>The target value is 96. The available numbers are 19, 68, and 47. I need to combine these three numbers using standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) exactly once each to reach 96.

Let's try different combinations and operations.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's consider the order of operations.

Attempt 1: Start with the largest number, 68.
68 + 19 = 87. Then use 47. 87 + 47 = 134 (too high). 87 - 47 = 40 (too low). 47 - 87 is negative. 87 * 47 is very large. 87 / 47 is not an integer.

68 - 19 = 49. Then use 47. 49 + 47 = 96. This works!
The numbers used are 68, 19, and 47.
The operations used are -, +.
I need to use three operations in total. The problem states ""standard arithmetic (+, -, *, /)"" and ""each number is used exactly once"". It doesn't explicitly state that each *operation* must be used, but it implies a combination of operations. However, the phrasing ""equation using [19 68 47] that evaluates to 96"" usually means combining the numbers. Let me re-read carefully. ""Use standard arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and ensure each number is used exactly once."" This implies I need to use the numbers 19, 68, and 47. It doesn't say I need to use all four operations. It says I can use these operations.

Let's assume I need to combine the three numbers using some combination of operations.
The equation (68 - 19) + 47 = 49 + 47 = 96.
This uses 68, 19, and 47 exactly once.
It uses the operations - and +.
This seems like a valid solution.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

Attempt 2: Multiplication first.
19 * 68 = 1292 (too large).
19 * 47 = 893 (too large).
68 * 47 = 3200 (too large).

Attempt 3: Division first.
68 / 19 is not an integer.
68 / 47 is not an integer.
47 / 19 is not an integer.
19 / 68 is a fraction.
19 / 47 is a fraction.
47 / 68 is a fraction.

So, division as the first operation is unlikely to lead to an integer result easily.

Let's go back to the successful attempt: (68 - 19) + 47 = 96.
This uses the numbers 19, 68, 47 exactly once.
It uses the operations - and +.
The target is 96.

Let's consider if there's any ambiguity about using *only* two operations. The prompt says ""Use standard arithmetic (+, -, *, /)"". This implies these are the *allowed* operations. It doesn't say I must use all of them, or a specific number of them. The core requirement is to use the numbers 19, 68, 47 exactly once to get 96.

Let's try another order for the same operations:
68 + 47 - 19 = 115 - 19 = 96. This also works.
Numbers used: 68, 47, 19. Operations: +, -.

Let's try another order:
47 + 68 - 19 = 115 - 19 = 96. This also works.

Let's try another order:
47 - 19 + 68 = 28 + 68 = 96. This also works.

Let's try another order:
19 + 68 + 47 = 134 (no)
19 + 47 + 68 = 134 (no)

Let's try subtraction in a different place.
19 - 68 + 47 = -49 + 47 = -2 (no)
19 - 47 + 68 = -28 + 68 = 40 (no)
47 - 68 + 19 = -21 + 19 = -2 (no)

What about multiplication or division?
Could we use multiplication to get closer?
If we multiply two numbers, the result is large.
Let's try to divide a large number by a smaller one, then add/subtract.
Suppose we have something like (A * B) / C or A + (B / C).
Since division of the given numbers doesn't yield integers easily, let's reconsider.

What if we use division in a way that cancels out or results in a useful number?
For example, if we had (68 * X) / Y.

Let's re-examine the successful equation: (68 - 19) + 47 = 96.
This is a perfectly valid equation using the numbers 19, 68, 47 exactly once and standard arithmetic operations.

Let's consider if there's a way to use multiplication or division.
Suppose we want to use multiplication.
If we multiply 19 and 47, we get 893. How to get 96 from 893 and 68? 893 - 68 is too large. 893 / 68 is not integer.
If we multiply 19 and 68, we get 1292. How to get 96 from 1292 and 47? Too large.
If we multiply 47 and 68, we get 3200. How to get 96 from 3200 and 19? Too large.

What about division?
If we had something like 19 * (68 / X) or (19 * 68) / X.
Let's try to construct an expression that might lead to 96.
We know 68 - 19 = 49. And 49 + 47 = 96.
So, (68 - 19) + 47 = 96. This is the simplest and most direct.

Let's think if there's any other structure.
Maybe something like A * B + C or A * B - C.
19 * 47 + 68 = 893 + 68 = 961 (no)
19 * 47 - 68 = 893 - 68 = 825 (no)
19 * 68 + 47 = 1292 + 47 = 1339 (no)
19 * 68 - 47 = 1292 - 47 = 1245 (no)
47 * 68 + 19 = 3200 + 19 = 3219 (no)
47 * 68 - 19 = 3200 - 19 = 3181 (no)

What about A + B * C or A - B * C?
19 + 47 * 68 = 19 + 3200 = 3219 (no)
19 - 47 * 68 = 19 - 3200 = -3181 (no)
47 + 19 * 68 = 47 + 1292 = 1339 (no)
47 - 19 * 68 = 47 - 1292 = -1245 (no)
68 + 19 * 47 = 68 + 893 = 961 (no)
68 - 19 * 47 = 68 - 893 = -825 (no)

What about A / B + C or A / B - C?
As noted, direct division of these numbers doesn't yield integers.

What about A * (B + C) or A * (B - C)?
19 * (68 + 47) = 19 * 115 = 2185 (no)
19 * (68 - 47) = 19 * 21 = 399 (no)
47 * (19 + 68) = 47 * 87 = 4089 (no)

<think>
The target number is 42. The given numbers are 75, 39, and 25.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 75.
How can we get from 75 to 42 using 39 and 25?
75 - ? = 42. The difference is 75 - 42 = 33.
Can we make 33 from 39 and 25?
39 - 25 = 14 (not 33)
39 + 25 = 64 (not 33)
39 * 25 = 975 (not 33)
39 / 25 (not a whole number, unlikely to be useful here)
25 - 39 (negative, not 33)
25 + 39 = 64 (not 33)
25 * 39 = 975 (not 33)
25 / 39 (not a whole number)

So, 75 - (something made from 39 and 25) = 42 doesn't seem to work.

Let's try another approach with 75.
What if we add something to 75 and then subtract? Or subtract and then add?
This seems less direct.

Possibility 2: Start with 39.
How can we get from 39 to 42 using 75 and 25?
39 + ? = 42. The difference is 42 - 39 = 3.
Can we make 3 from 75 and 25?
75 - 25 = 50 (not 3)
75 + 25 = 100 (not 3)
75 * 25 = 1875 (not 3)
75 / 25 = 3. Yes!
So, we can have 39 + (75 / 25) = 42.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 39 (yes), 75 (yes), 25 (yes).
The operations used are addition and division.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's just quickly check other combinations to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

Possibility 3: Start with 25.
How can we get from 25 to 42 using 75 and 39?
25 + ? = 42. The difference is 42 - 25 = 17.
Can we make 17 from 75 and 39?
75 - 39 = 36 (not 17)
75 + 39 = 114 (not 17)
75 * 39 (too large)
75 / 39 (not a whole number)
39 - 75 (negative)
39 + 75 = 114 (not 17)
39 * 75 (too large)
39 / 75 (not a whole number)

So, 25 + (something made from 75 and 39) = 42 doesn't seem to work.

What about subtraction from 25?
25 - ? = 42. This would mean ? = 25 - 42 = -17. We can't easily make -17 from positive numbers with the allowed operations.

What about multiplication or division involving 25?
25 * ? = 42 (not likely with whole numbers)
25 / ? = 42 (not likely)
? / 25 = 42. ? = 42 * 25 = 1050. Can we make 1050 from 75 and 39? 75 * 39 = 2925. No.

Let's re-examine the solution found: 39 + (75 / 25) = 42.
This uses 39, 75, and 25 exactly once.
It uses addition and division.
The calculation is: 75 / 25 = 3. Then 39 + 3 = 42.
This is correct.

Let's consider if there are other ways to combine them.
What if we used subtraction differently?
(75 - 39) + 25 = 36 + 25 = 61 (not 42)
(75 - 25) + 39 = 50 + 39 = 89 (not 42)
(39 - 25) + 75 = 14 + 75 = 89 (not 42)
(75 + 39) - 25 = 114 - 25 = 89 (not 42)
(75 + 25) - 39 = 100 - 39 = 61 (not 42)
(39 + 25) - 75 = 64 - 75 = -11 (not 42)

What about multiplication?
(75 * 39) / 25 (too large)
(75 * 25) / 39 (not whole)
(39 * 25) / 75 = 975 / 75 = 13 (not 42)

What about division first?
75 / 39 (not whole)
75 / 25 = 3. We already used this: 39 + 3 = 42.
39 / 75 (not whole)
39 / 25 (not whole)
25 / 75 (not whole)
25 / 39 (not whole)

It seems the most straightforward and correct solution is 39 + (75 / 25).

211,1592,"<think>The problem requires me to find an arithmetic equation that equals 36 using the numbers 63, 89, 65, and 27 exactly once, and only the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: {63, 89, 65, 27}.
The target value is 36.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. This means I'll have three operations in total.

Let's consider the order of operations. Parentheses can be used to control the order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op (c op d)
2. ((a op b) op c) op d
3. (a op (b op c)) op d
4. a op ((b op c) op d)
5. a op (b op (c op d))

Let's try to get close to 36 with some initial combinations.

The numbers are relatively large. Division might be useful to reduce the magnitude.
63 / 27 is not an integer. 63/27 = 7/3.
65 / 27 is not an integer.
89 / 27 is not an integer.
63 / 65 is not an integer.
89 / 65 is not an integer.
89 / 63 is not an integer.

Let's try multiplication.
63 * 27 is very large.
63 * 89 is very large.
63 * 65 is very large.

Subtraction might be useful to reduce large numbers.
63 - 27 = 36. This is promising!
If I can make the remaining numbers (89, 65) combine to 0, then (63 - 27) + (89 - 65) would be 36 + 24 = 60. Not 36.
If I can make the remaining numbers (89, 65) combine to 0, then (63 - 27) * (89 - 65) would be 36 * 24. Too large.
If I can make the remaining numbers (89, 65) combine to 0, then (63 - 27) / (89 - 65) would be 36 / 24. Not an integer.

Let's try another subtraction that results in a useful number.
65 - 63 = 2.
65 - 27 = 38.
89 - 63 = 26.
89 - 65 = 24.
89 - 27 = 62.
27 - 63 = -36.
27 - 65 = -38.
27 - 89 = -62.
63 - 65 = -2.
63 - 89 = -26.
65 - 89 = -24.

The combination 63 - 27 = 36 is very direct. Let's see if we can use the other two numbers (89, 65) to somehow cancel out or become a multiplier/divisor that doesn't change 36.
If we have (63 - 27) * X = 36, then X must be 1. Can we make 89 and 65 combine to 1?
89 / 65 is not 1.
89 - 65 = 24.
89 + 65 = 154.
65 - 89 = -24.

If we have (63 - 27) / X = 36, then X must be 1. Same problem.

What if 36 is an intermediate result?
Let's try to get a number that divides nicely into one of the larger numbers.
27 is a factor of 63? No. 63 = 7 * 9, 27 = 3 * 9. 63/27 = 7/3.
27 is a factor of 81 (not present).
27 is a factor of 54 (not present).

Let's consider the numbers again: {63, 89, 65, 27}. Target: 36.

Try combining two numbers first.
63 + 27 = 90. Remaining: {89, 65}. 90 op 89 op 65.
90 + 89 + 65 = 244.
90 - 89 - 65 = 1 - 65 = -64.
90 + 89 - 65 = 179 - 65 = 114.
90 - 89 + 65 = 1 + 65 = 66.
90 * 89 * 65 (too big)
90 / 89 (not integer)
90 / 65 (not integer)

63 - 27 = 36. Remaining: {89, 65}.
We already explored this. (63 - 27) op (89 op 65).
(63 - 27) + (89 - 65) = 36 + 24 = 60.
(63 - 27) - (89 - 65) = 36 - 24 = 12.
(63 - 27) + (65 - 89) = 36 + (-24) = 12.
(63 - 27) - (65 - 89) = 36 - (-24) = 60.
(63 - 27) * (89 - 65) = 36 * 24 (too big).
(63 - 27) / (89 - 65) = 36 / 24 (not integer).

Let's try other pairings.
63 + 89 = 152. Remaining: {65, 27}.
152 op 65 op 27.
152 - 65 - 27 = 87 - 27 = 60.
152 - 65 + 27 = 87 + 27 = 114.
152 + 65 - 27 = 217 - 27 = 190.

63 * 27 = 1701. Remaining: {89, 65}. Too big.

Let's try to create a number that, when operated with another, gives a number close to 36.
Consider 89.
89 - 63 = 26. Remaining: {65, 27}.
26 op 65 op 27.
26 + 65 + 27 = 91 + 27 = 118.
26 + 65 - 27 = 91 - 27 = 64.
26 - 65 + 27 = -39 + 27 = -12.
26 - 65 - 27 = -39 - 27 = -66.

Consider 65.
65 - 27 = 38. Remaining: {63, 89}.
38 op 63 op 89.
38 + 63 + 89 = 101 + 89 = 190.
38 + 63 - 89 = 101 - 89 = 12.
38 - 63 + 89 = -25 + 89 = 64.
38 - 63 - 89 = -25 - 89 = -114.

Let's try division first.
63 / ?
63 / 27 = 7/3.
63 / 65 (not integer)
63 / 89 (not integer)

27 / ?
27 / 63 (not integer)
27 / 65 (not integer)
27 / 89 (not integer)

Let's try to make a number that can be divided by another to get a useful result.
Maybe we can create 72, which is 2 * 36.
Or 18, which is 36 / 2.
Or 108, which is 3 * 36.

Let's look at the numbers again: {63, 89, 65, 27}. Target: 36.

So, two possible solutions are 48 - 15 + 41 = 74 and 41 - 15 + 48 = 74.
I will choose one of them.

Let's verify 48 - 15 + 41:
48 - 15 = 33
33 + 41 = 74. Correct.

Let's verify 41 - 15 + 48:
41 - 15 = 26
26 + 48 = 74. Correct.

I will present the first one found.

The problem asks me to find an equation that equals 37 using the numbers 32, 91, and 96 exactly once, with only the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let the given numbers be $a=32$, $b=91$, and $c=96$. I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations to get 37.

I will explore different combinations and permutations of the numbers and operations.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c$
2. $a \text{ op1 } (b \text{ op2 } c)$

Let's try combinations with the numbers in the order 32, 91, 96.

**Attempt 1: Using (32 op1 91) op2 96**

*   **Case 1.1: Addition first**
    *   $(32 + 91) + 96 = 123 + 96 = 219$ (Not 37)

    *   $(32 + 91) * 96 = 123 * 96$ (Too large, not 37)
    *   $(32 + 91) / 96 = 123 / 96$ (Not an integer, likely not 37)

*   **Case 1.2: Subtraction first**
    *   $(32 - 91) + 96 = -59 + 96 = 37$ (Found a solution!)
    *   Let's verify: $32 - 91 = -59$. Then $-59 + 96 = 37$. This works.
    *   The equation is $(32 - 91) + 96 = 37$.
    *   Numbers used: 32, 91, 96 (exactly once).
    *   Operations used: -, + (basic arithmetic).
    *   Result: 37.

    *   The equation is $32 - (91 - 96) = 37$.
    *   Numbers used: 32, 91, 96 (exactly once).

The user wants a mathematical equation using the numbers [90, 10, 80, 68] exactly once to reach a target sum of 14. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

1.  **Start with the largest numbers:**
    *   90 and 80.
    *   90 - 80 = 10. Now I have [10, 10, 68] and need to get 14.
        *   10 + 10 = 20. 20 + 68 = 88 (too big). 20 - 68 (negative). 68 - 20 = 48 (too big).
        *   10 * 10 = 100. 100 + 68 (too big). 100 - 68 = 32 (too big). 68 - 100 (negative).
        *   10 / 10 = 1. 1 + 68 = 69 (too big). 68 - 1 = 67 (too big).
    *   90 + 80 = 170 (too big).
    *   90 * 80 (way too big).
    *   90 / 80 (fraction).

2.  **Try combining 90 and 10:**
    *   90 + 10 = 100. Now I have [100, 80, 68] and need 14.
        *   100 - 80 = 20. 20 + 68 = 88. 20 - 68 (negative). 68 - 20 = 48.
        *   100 / 80 (fraction).

        *   80 / 80 = 1. 1 + 68 = 69. 68 - 1 = 67.
    *   90 * 10 = 900 (too big).

        *   9 - 80 (negative).
        *   9 * 80 (too big).
        *   80 - 9 = 71. 71 + 68 (too big). 71 - 68 = 3. 68 - 71 (negative).
        *   80 + 9 = 89. 89 + 68 (too big). 89 - 68 = 21. 68 - 89 (negative).
        *   80 * 9 (too big).
        *   80 / 9 (fraction).
        *   68 - 9 = 59. 59 + 80 (too big). 80 - 59 = 21.
        *   68 + 9 = 77. 77 + 80 (too big). 80 - 77 = 3.
        *   68 * 9 (too big).
        *   68 / 9 (fraction).
        *   Let's try combining 80 and 68 first with 9.
        *   80 + 68 = 148. 148 + 9 (too big). 148 - 9 = 139. 9 - 148 (negative).
        *   80 - 68 = 12. 12 + 9 = 21. 12 - 9 = 3. 9 - 12 (negative).
        *   68 - 80 (negative).
        *   80 * 68 (too big).
        *   80 / 68 (fraction).
        *   68 / 80 (fraction).

3.  **Try combining 80 and 10:**
    *   80 + 10 = 90. Now I have [90, 90, 68] and need 14.
        *   90 - 90 = 0. 0 + 68 = 68.
        *   90 / 90 = 1. 1 + 68 = 69. 68 - 1 = 67.
    *   80 - 10 = 70. Now I have [70, 90, 68] and need 14.
        *   90 - 70 = 20. 20 + 68 = 88. 20 - 68 (negative). 68 - 20 = 48.
        *   70 - 90 (negative).
        *   90 - 68 = 22. 22 + 70 = 92. 70 - 22 = 48.
        *   68 - 70 (negative).
        *   Let's try division. 70 / ?
    *   80 * 10 = 800 (too big).
    *   80 / 10 = 8. Now I have [8, 90, 68] and need 14.
        *   90 - 68 = 22. 22 - 8 = 14. This works!
        *   The numbers used are 90, 68, and 8 (which came from 80/10).
        *   So the equation is (90 - 68) - (80 / 10) = 14.
        *   Let's check: 90 - 68 = 22. 80 / 10 = 8. 22 - 8 = 14.
        *   All numbers [90, 10, 80, 68] are used exactly once.
        *   Operations are standard arithmetic.
        *   Target sum is 14.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities, but this one seems correct.

Another approach:
Try to get a number close to 14 by dividing.
*   90 / 10 = 9. Remaining: [80, 68]. Need 14 - 9 = 5. Can't get 5 from 80 and 68.
*   80 / 10 = 8. Remaining: [90, 68]. Need 14 - 8 = 6. Can't get 6 from 90 and 68.
*   68 / ?

Let's try to get a number that, when combined with another, results in 14.
*   Maybe something like X - Y = 14.
    *   If X = 90, Y = 76. Can I get 76 from [10, 80, 68]? 80 - 10 + 68 (too big). 80 + 10 - 68 = 22. 80 - 68 + 10 = 22.
    *   If X = 80, Y = 66. Can I get 66 from [90, 10, 68]? 90 - 10 - 68 = 12. 90 - 68 - 10 = 12.
    *   If X = 68, Y = 54. Can I get 54 from [90, 10, 80]? 90 - 10 - 80 = 0. 90 - 80 + 10 = 20.

Let's list the numbers: [34, 3, 58, 90]
Target: 98

I need to combine these four numbers. I can try different combinations and operations.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust.
2. Try to get close to 98 with two numbers and then use the other two to adjust.

Let's try combining 90 and 58.
90 + 58 = 148 (Too high)
90 - 58 = 32 (Too low)
58 - 90 = -32 (Not useful)
90 * 58 (Too high)
90 / 58 (Not an integer)

Let's try combining 90 and 34.
90 + 34 = 124 (Too high)
90 - 34 = 56 (Too low)
34 - 90 = -56 (Not useful)
90 * 34 (Too high)
90 / 34 (Not an integer)

Let's try combining 58 and 34.
58 + 34 = 92 (Close to 98!)
If I have 92, I need to add 6. The remaining numbers are 90 and 3.
Can I get 6 from 90 and 3?
90 / 3 = 30 (Not 6)
90 - 3 = 87 (Not 6)
3 - 90 = -87 (Not 6)
90 * 3 = 270 (Not 6)
So, (58 + 34) + (something from 90 and 3) doesn't seem to work directly.

What if I use 90 and 3?
90 + 3 = 93 (Close to 98)
Remaining numbers: 34, 58. Need to get 5.
Can I get 5 from 34 and 58?

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe one of the numbers needs to be multiplied by a small number.
Let's try using 3.
If I multiply 34 by 3: 34 * 3 = 102.
Remaining numbers: 58, 90. Target is 98.
From 102, I need to subtract 4.
Can I get 4 from 58 and 90?

Can I get 172 from 34 and 58?
58 + 34 = 92 (Not 172)
58 * 34 (Too large)

Let's reconsider 58 + 34 = 92. We need +6.
Remaining numbers are 90 and 3.
What if we use division?
(90 / 3) = 30. Not 6.
What if we subtract 90 from something? Or 3 from something?

Let's try a different structure.
Maybe (A + B) - (C + D) or (A * B) + (C * D) etc.

Let's try to get close to 98 with two numbers and then use the other two.
90 + 3 = 93. Need +5 from 34 and 58. No.
90 - 3 = 87. Need +11 from 34 and 58. No.
58 + 34 = 92. Need +6 from 90 and 3. No.

34 + 3 = 37. Need +61 from 90 and 58. No.
34 - 3 = 31. Need +67 from 90 and 58. No.

Let's try using division to reduce a large number.
90 / 3 = 30.

58 + 34 = 92 (Not 68)
58 - 34 = 24 (Not 68)
34 - 58 = -24 (Not 68)
So, (90 / 3) + (something from 34 and 58) doesn't work.

What if we do (90 / 3) + 58 + 34?
30 + 58 + 34 = 122. (Too high)

What if we do 90 + 58 - 34 - 3?
148 - 34 - 3 = 114 - 3 = 111. (Too high)

What if we do 90 + 34 - 58 + 3?
124 - 58 + 3 = 66 + 3 = 69. (Too low)

What if we do 90 + 34 + 3 - 58?
124 + 3 - 58 = 127 - 58 = 69. (Too low)

Let's try multiplication again.
Maybe 34 * 3 = 102.
We need to get from 102 to 98. That's -4.
Remaining numbers are 90 and 58.
Can we get -4 from 90 and 58?
58 - 90 = -32. No.
90 - 58 = 32. No.

Let's try 58 * 3 = 174.

I need to combine these four numbers using +, -, *, / to get 87.

Possible starting points:

The user wants an equation using the numbers 26, 71, 58, and 38, with the result being 40.
I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [26, 71, 58, 38]
Target: 40

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.
Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(71 - 58) = 13. Then I have 26 and 38 left.
13 + 26 + 38 = 77 (Too high)
13 * 26 + 38 = 338 + 38 = 376 (Too high)
13 + 26 * 38 = 13 + 988 = 1001 (Too high)
13 - 26 + 38 = -13 + 38 = 25 (Too low)
13 + 38 - 26 = 51 - 26 = 25 (Too low)
13 * 38 + 26 = 494 + 26 = 520 (Too high)
13 + 26 - 38 = 39 - 38 = 1 (Too low)

Possibility 2: Try multiplication early.
26 * 38 = 988 (Too high, likely need subtraction)
26 * 71 = 1846 (Too high)
26 * 58 = 1508 (Too high)
71 * 58 = 4118 (Too high)
71 * 38 = 2700 (Too high)
58 * 38 = 2204 (Too high)

This suggests that multiplication might be used with smaller numbers or in a way that reduces the overall value. Or perhaps division is involved.

Let's try to get close to 40.
Maybe combine two numbers to get something around 40, then use the other two.
26 + 38 = 64. Left: 71, 58.
64 - 71 + 58 = -7 + 58 = 51 (Close, but not 40)
64 + 58 - 71 = 122 - 71 = 51 (Same)
64 - 58 + 71 = 6 + 71 = 77 (Too high)

26 + 58 = 84. Left: 71, 38.
84 - 71 + 38 = 13 + 38 = 51 (Close)
84 + 38 - 71 = 122 - 71 = 51 (Same)

26 + 71 = 97. Left: 58, 38.
97 - 58 - 38 = 39 - 38 = 1 (Too low)
97 - 38 - 58 = 59 - 58 = 1 (Same)

38 + 58 = 96. Left: 26, 71.
96 - 71 + 26 = 25 + 26 = 51 (Close)
96 + 26 - 71 = 122 - 71 = 51 (Same)

38 + 71 = 109. Left: 26, 58.
109 - 58 - 26 = 51 - 26 = 25 (Too low)

58 + 71 = 129. Left: 26, 38.
129 - 38 - 26 = 91 - 26 = 65 (Too high)

Let's try subtraction first.
71 - 26 = 45. Left: 58, 38.
45 + 58 - 38 = 103 - 38 = 65 (Too high)
45 - 58 + 38 = -13 + 38 = 25 (Too low)
45 + 38 - 58 = 83 - 58 = 25 (Too low)

71 - 38 = 33. Left: 26, 58.
33 + 26 + 58 = 59 + 58 = 117 (Too high)
33 + 58 - 26 = 91 - 26 = 65 (Too high)
33 - 26 + 58 = 7 + 58 = 65 (Too high)

71 - 58 = 13. Left: 26, 38.
13 + 26 + 38 = 77 (Too high)
13 + 38 - 26 = 51 - 26 = 25 (Too low)
13 + 26 - 38 = 39 - 38 = 1 (Too low)

58 - 26 = 32. Left: 71, 38.
32 + 71 - 38 = 103 - 38 = 65 (Too high)
32 - 71 + 38 = -39 + 38 = -1 (Too low)

58 - 38 = 20. Left: 26, 71.
20 + 26 + 71 = 46 + 71 = 117 (Too high)
20 + 71 - 26 = 91 - 26 = 65 (Too high)
20 - 26 + 71 = -6 + 71 = 65 (Too high)

38 - 26 = 12. Left: 71, 58.
12 + 71 - 58 = 83 - 58 = 25 (Too low)
12 + 58 - 71 = 70 - 71 = -1 (Too low)

Let's consider division.
Can any number be divided by another to get a useful integer?
71 / 26 (no)
71 / 38 (no)
71 / 58 (no)
58 / 26 (no)
58 / 38 (no)
38 / 26 (no)
26 / 38 (no)
26 / 58 (no)
26 / 71 (no)
38 / 58 (no)
38 / 71 (no)
58 / 71 (no)

This means division must be part of a larger expression, like (A+B)/C or A/(B+C).
Or perhaps the division results in a non-integer that is then used. But the problem implies integer arithmetic. Let's assume integer results for intermediate steps if possible, or that the final result is an integer.

Let's try to construct 40.
Maybe a large number minus something.
71 - X = 40 => X = 31. Can I make 31 from [26, 58, 38]?

The user wants me to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers 31, 11, and 54 exactly once to reach the target value of 12. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (54):**
    *   54 / ? = 12 (Doesn't seem easy with 31 and 11)
    *   54 - ? = 12 => ? = 42. Can I make 42 from 31 and 11?
        *   31 + 11 = 42. Yes!
        *   So, 54 - (31 + 11) = 54 - 42 = 12. This works.

2.  **Check other combinations just in case:**
    *   (31 + 11) * 54 = 42 * 54 (Too large)
    *   (31 - 11) * 54 = 20 * 54 (Too large)
    *   (31 * 11) + 54 = 341 + 54 (Too large)
    *   (31 * 11) - 54 = 341 - 54 = 287 (Not 12)
    *   (54 / 11) ... not an integer.
    *   (54 / 31) ... not an integer.
    *   (31 / 11) ... not an integer.
    *   (11 / 31) ... not an integer.
    *   (11 / 54) ... not an integer.
    *   (31 / 54) ... not an integer.

The combination 54 - (31 + 11) = 12 seems to be the most straightforward and correct solution.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to reach 65.

Initial thoughts:

The user wants an algebraic expression using the numbers 97, 2, 4, and 41.
The expression must evaluate to 30.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: [97, 2, 4, 41]
Target value: 30

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations to get 30.

Let's try some combinations.
It's often useful to try to get close to the target value first.
41 is the largest number. 97 is also large.
Maybe subtraction is involved to reduce the large numbers.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(97 - 41) = 56. Remaining numbers are 2, 4. Target from 56 to 30 means we need to subtract 26. Can we get 26 from 2 and 4? 2*4=8, 2+4=6, 4-2=2, 4/2=2. No.

Possibility 2: Try multiplication to get closer.
41 * 2 = 82. Remaining numbers are 97, 4. Target from 82 to 30 means we need to subtract 52. Can we get 52 from 97 and 4? 97-4 = 93, 97+4 = 101, 97*4 = 388, 97/4 (not integer). No.
41 * 4 = 164. Remaining numbers are 97, 2. Target from 164 to 30 means we need to subtract 134. Can we get 134 from 97 and 2? 97+2=99, 97-2=95, 97*2=194. No.
97 * 2 = 194. Remaining numbers are 41, 4. Target from 194 to 30 means we need to subtract 164. Can we get 164 from 41 and 4? 41*4=164. Yes!
So, (97 * 2) - (41 * 4) = 194 - 164 = 30.
This uses all numbers [97, 2, 41, 4] exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's double check the expression:
(97 * 2) - (41 * 4)
Numbers used: 97, 2, 41, 4. All used once.
Operations used: *, -, *. All allowed.
Evaluation: 194 - 164 = 30. Correct.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one seems valid and found relatively quickly.

What if division is used?
97 / 2 (not integer)
97 / 4 (not integer)
41 / 2 (not integer)
41 / 4 (not integer)
4 / 2 = 2. Remaining numbers are 97, 41. Target from 2 to 30 means we need to add 28. Can we get 28 from 97 and 41? 97-41 = 56, 97+41 = 138. No.
2 / 4 (fraction)

Let's try combining numbers in a different order.
Maybe something like (A + B) * C - D or A * (B - C) + D.

Try to get a number close to 30 directly.
41 - 97 (negative)
41 - 4 = 37. Remaining numbers are 97, 2. Target from 37 to 30 means subtract 7. Can we get 7 from 97 and 2? No.
41 - 2 = 39. Remaining numbers are 97, 4. Target from 39 to 30 means subtract 9. Can we get 9 from 97 and 4? No.

Let's revisit the successful one: (97 * 2) - (41 * 4) = 30.
This is a valid solution.

Are there other ways?
Consider (41 * 2) + (97 - 4) = 82 + 93 = 175 (too high)
Consider (41 * 4) + (97 - 2) = 164 + 95 = 259 (too high)
Consider (97 / ?) - ... (division by 2 or 4 won't yield integers)

Let's try to make a smaller number first.
(4 * 2) = 8. Remaining: 97, 41. Target from 8 to 30 means add 22. Can we get 22 from 97 and 41? 97-41 = 56. No.

What about (41 + 97) / ?
(41 + 97) = 138. Remaining: 2, 4. 138/2 = 69. 138/4 (not integer).
(41 - 97) / ? (negative)
(97 - 41) = 56. Remaining: 2, 4. 56/2 = 28. 56/4 = 14.
If 56/2 = 28, we need to get 30 from 28 using 4. 28+4=32, 28-4=24, 28*4=112, 28/4=7. No.
If 56/4 = 14, we need to get 30 from 14 using 2. 14+2=16, 14-2=12, 14*2=28, 14/2=7. No.

Let's try division at the end.
(97 + 41 + 2 + 4) = 144. 144 / ?
(97 + 41 + 2) / 4 = 140 / 4 = 35. Close. Numbers used: 97, 41, 2, 4.
Expression: (97 + 41 + 2) / 4 = 35. Not 30.

(97 + 41 + 4) / 2 = 142 / 2 = 71.
(97 + 2 + 4) / 41 = 103 / 41 (not integer)
(41 + 2 + 4) / 97 = 47 / 97 (not integer)

Let's try subtraction at the end.
(97 * 2) - (41 * 4) = 194 - 164 = 30. This is the one.

Let's try another structure: A - B * C + D
97 - (41 * 2) + 4 = 97 - 82 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19.
97 - (41 * 4) + 2 = 97 - 164 + 2 = -67 + 2 = -65.
97 - (2 * 4) + 41 = 97 - 8 + 41 = 89 + 41 = 130.
41 - (97 * 2) + 4 = 41 - 194 + 4 = -153 + 4 = -149.

Let's try A + B * C - D
97 + (41 * 2) - 4 = 97 + 82 - 4 = 179 - 4 = 175.
97 + (41 * 4) - 2 = 97 + 164 - 2 = 261 - 2 = 259.
97 + (2 * 4) - 41 = 97 + 8 - 41 = 105 - 41 = 64.

Let's try A * B - C * D
(97 * 2) - (41 * 4) = 194 - 164 = 30. This is the one.
(97 * 4) - (41 * 2) = 388 - 82 = 306.

108,1534,"<think>The target is 15. The numbers are [68, 2, 19, 15]. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try to combine the numbers.
The number 15 is already in the set. This is a strong hint.
If we can make the other numbers combine to 0, then we can just add 15.
The remaining numbers are 68, 2, and 19.
Can we make 0 from 68, 2, and 19 using +, -, *, /?
Possible combinations:
68 - 2 - 19 = 47 (not 0)
68 + 2 - 19 = 51 (not 0)
68 * 2 - 19 = 136 - 19 = 117 (not 0)

It seems making 0 from the remaining numbers is not straightforward.

Let's consider other approaches.
Maybe we can make a number that, when combined with 15, gives 15.
For example, if we can make 0 from 68, 2, 19, then (68 op 2 op 19) + 15 = 15. We already explored this.
Or, if we can make 15 from 68, 2, 19, then (68 op 2 op 19) * 15 = 15. This would require (68 op 2 op 19) to be 1.
Or, if we can make 15 from 68, 2, 19, then (68 op 2 op 19) / 15 = 15. This would require (68 op 2 op 19) to be 225.
Or, if we can make 15 from 68, 2, 19, then 15 + (68 op 2 op 19) = 15. This requires (68 op 2 op 19) to be 0.
Or, if we can make 15 from 68, 2, 19, then 15 * (68 op 2 op 19) = 15. This requires (68 op 2 op 19) to be 1.
Or, if we can make 15 from 68, 2, 19, then 15 / (68 op 2 op 19) = 15. This requires (68 op 2 op 19) to be 1.

Let's try to make 1 from 68, 2, 19.
68 / 2 = 34. 34 - 19 = 15. Not 1.
19 * 2 = 38. 68 - 38 = 30. Not 1.
68 - 19 = 49. 49 / 2 (not integer).
19 - 2 = 17. 68 / 17 (not integer).
68 + 2 = 70. 70 - 19 = 51.
68 + 19 = 87. 87 / 2 (not integer).
2 + 19 = 21. 68 / 21 (not integer).

Let's try to make 225 from 68, 2, 19.
68 * 2 = 136. 136 + 19 = 155. Not 225.
68 * 19 = 1292. Too big.
68 + 2 + 19 = 89.
68 * 2 * 19 = 2584.

Let's try to use the 15 in a different way.
Maybe we can make a number that, when operated with 15, results in 15.
For example, if we can make 0 from 68, 2, 19, then 15 + (68 op 2 op 19) = 15.
Or if we can make 1 from 68, 2, 19, then 15 * (68 op 2 op 19) = 15.
Or if we can make 1 from 68, 2, 19, then 15 / (68 op 2 op 19) = 15.

Let's re-examine making 0 from 68, 2, 19.
We tried simple combinations. What about division?
68 / 2 = 34.
19.
Can we make 34 from 19 and something else? No.
Can we make 19 from 34 and something else? No.

Let's try to make 1 from 68, 2, 19.
We saw 68 / 2 = 34, and 34 - 19 = 15.
What if we do (68 / 2) - 19? This uses 68, 2, 19 and results in 15.
So, we have (68 / 2) - 19 = 15.
We still have the number 15 to use.
If we have (68 / 2) - 19 = 15, and we need to use the number 15.
We can do: ((68 / 2) - 19) * 15. This would be 15 * 15 = 225. Not 15.
We can do: ((68 / 2) - 19) + 15. This would be 15 + 15 = 30. Not 15.
We can do: ((68 / 2) - 19) - 15. This would be 15 - 15 = 0. Not 15.
We can do: ((68 / 2) - 19) / 15. This would be 15 / 15 = 1. Not 15.

This means the 15 from the set must be involved in a way that it doesn't just get added or multiplied at the end.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with 15, gives 15.
This means we need to make 0 from 68, 2, 19. We already tried this and it seemed difficult.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with 15, gives 15.
This means we need to make 1 from 68, 2, 19.
We saw (68 / 2) - 19 = 15. This is not 1.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with 15, gives 15.
This means we need to make 15 from 68, 2, 19.
We found (68 / 2) - 19 = 15.
So, we have the expression (68 / 2) - 19 which evaluates to 15.
We still need to use the number 15 from the set.
If we have (68 / 2) - 19 = 15, and we need to use the number 15.
We can do: 15 + ((68 / 2) - 19). This is 15 + 15 = 30.
We can do: 15 - ((68 / 2) - 19). This is 15 - 15 = 0.
We can do: 15 * ((68 / 2) - 19). This is 15 * 15 = 225.
We can do: 15 / ((68 / 2) - 19). This is 15 / 15 = 1.

This implies that the number 15 from the set must be used in a way that it's not the final operation.

The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers 20, 39, and 53 exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, /. The target result is 34.

Let's list the numbers: [20, 39, 53]
Target: 34

Possible combinations of two numbers and an operation, then combine with the third:

1.  (20 op1 39) op2 53 = 34
2.  (20 op1 53) op2 39 = 34
3.  (39 op1 53) op2 20 = 34

Let's try combinations:

**Case 1: (20 op1 39) op2 53 = 34**

*   (20 + 39) + 53 = 59 + 53 = 112 (Too high)
*   (20 + 39) - 53 = 59 - 53 = 6 (Too low)
*   (20 + 39) * 53 = 59 * 53 (Too high)
*   (20 + 39) / 53 = 59 / 53 (Not an integer, unlikely)

*   (20 - 39) + 53 = -19 + 53 = 34. This looks promising! Let's check if all numbers are used and operations are valid.
    *   Numbers used: 20, 39, 53. Yes.
    *   Operations used: -, +. Yes.
    *   Result: 34. Yes.
    *   Equation: (20 - 39) + 53 = 34. This is a valid solution.

Let's continue exploring just to be thorough, but we've found a solution.

*   (20 - 39) - 53 = -19 - 53 = -72 (Too low)
*   (20 - 39) * 53 = -19 * 53 (Too low)
*   (20 - 39) / 53 = -19 / 53 (Not an integer)

*   (20 * 39) + 53 = 780 + 53 = 833 (Too high)

*   (20 * 39) * 53 (Too high)
*   (20 * 39) / 53 = 780 / 53 (Not an integer)

*   (20 / 39) ... (Not integer)

**Case 2: (20 op1 53) op2 39 = 34**

*   (20 + 53) + 39 = 73 + 39 = 112 (Too high)

    *   Operations used: +, -. Yes.
    *   Result: 34. Yes.
    *   Equation: (20 + 53) - 39 = 34. This is also a valid solution.

*   (20 - 53) + 39 = -33 + 39 = 6 (Too low)
*   (20 - 53) - 39 = -33 - 39 = -72 (Too low)

**Case 3: (39 op1 53) op2 20 = 34**

We found two valid solutions:
1.  (20 - 39) + 53 = 34
2.  (20 + 53) - 39 = 34

The prompt asks for ""the computed equation"", implying one. I will provide the first one I found.
Let's re-verify (20 - 39) + 53.
20 - 39 = -19
-19 + 53 = 34. Correct.

Let's re-verify (20 + 53) - 39.
20 + 53 = 73
73 - 39 = 34. Correct.

Both are valid. I'll pick one. The order of operations matters if parentheses are not used, but here they are implied by the structure.
If I write 20 - 39 + 53, it's evaluated left to right: (20 - 39) + 53 = -19 + 53 = 34.
If I write 20 + 53 - 39, it's evaluated left to right: (20 + 53) - 39 = 73 - 39 = 34.

I will present (20 + 53) - 39 as it uses addition first, which might be slightly more intuitive for some.

<answer>(20 + 53) - 39 = 34</answer>",1.0,
5205,1308,"<think>The numbers are 9, 32, 64, and 58. The target is 99. I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining numbers.
The target 99 is close to 100.
Maybe I can get something close to 100 and adjust.

Possible combinations:
- 64 + 32 = 96. Then I have 9 and 58 left. 96 + 9 = 105. 105 - 58 = 47 (no). 96 + 58 = 154. 154 - 9 = 145 (no).
- 64 - 32 = 32. Then I have 9 and 58 left. 32 + 9 + 58 = 99. This works!

Let's check the order of operations.
(64 - 32) + 9 + 58 = 32 + 9 + 58 = 41 + 58 = 99.
This uses all numbers exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
Maybe multiplication is involved.
9 * 32 = 288 (too big)
9 * 64 = 576 (too big)
9 * 58 = 522 (too big)
32 * 64 (too big)
32 * 58 (too big)
64 * 58 (too big)

Division might be useful if it results in a whole number.
64 / 32 = 2. Numbers left are 9 and 58. 2 + 9 + 58 = 69 (no). 2 * 9 + 58 = 18 + 58 = 76 (no). 2 + 9 * 58 (too big). 2 * 58 + 9 = 116 + 9 = 125 (no).

Let's go back to the addition/subtraction approach.
We found (64 - 32) + 9 + 58 = 99.

Can we rearrange it?
9 + 58 + (64 - 32) = 99.
58 + 9 + (64 - 32) = 99.

What if we try to get 99 directly?
Maybe something like X * Y + Z - W = 99.
Or X + Y * Z - W = 99.

Let's consider the numbers again: 9, 32, 64, 58. Target: 99.

Try to get close to 99 with two numbers.
58 + 32 = 90. Left: 9, 64. 90 + 9 = 99. Then I have 64 left. How to use 64? 99 + 64 (too big). 99 - 64 = 35 (no).
So, 58 + 32 + 9 is not enough because 64 is unused.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 99 and subtract.
64 + 32 + 9 = 105. Left: 58. 105 - 58 = 47 (no).

Let's try to get a number slightly smaller than 99 and add.
58 + 32 = 90. Left: 9, 64. 90 + 9 = 99. Need to use 64.
What if we do 90 + (something with 9 and 64)?
90 + 9 = 99. Need to use 64.
90 + 64 = 154. Need to use 9. 154 - 9 = 145 (no).

Let's reconsider the first solution: (64 - 32) + 9 + 58 = 99.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there are other possibilities.
Maybe multiplication is used in a way that reduces the numbers.
For example, if we had a division that resulted in a small number.
64 / 32 = 2. Numbers left: 9, 58. Target: 99.
2 + 9 + 58 = 69 (no)
2 * 9 + 58 = 18 + 58 = 76 (no)
2 + 9 * 58 (too big)
2 * 58 + 9 = 116 + 9 = 125 (no)

What about 58 / 9? Not a whole number.
64 / 9? Not a whole number.
32 / 9? Not a whole number.

Let's try to get a number close to 99 using multiplication.
9 * ?
9 * 10 = 90. Can I make 10 from 32, 64, 58? No.
9 * 11 = 99. Can I make 11 from 32, 64, 58? No.

Let's try to get a number that, when added/subtracted from another number, gives 99.
For example, 58 + X = 99, so X = 41. Can I make 41 from 9, 32, 64?
9 + 32 = 41. Yes!
So, 58 + (9 + 32) = 99.
This uses 58, 9, 32. I still need to use 64.
How to incorporate 64?
58 + (9 + 32) + 64 (too big)
58 + (9 + 32) - 64 = 99 - 64 = 35 (no)
58 + (9 + 32 - 64) = 58 + (41 - 64) = 58 + (-23) = 35 (no)

Let's try another combination for 41.
64 - 32 + 9 = 32 + 9 = 41.
So, 58 + (64 - 32 + 9) = 58 + 41 = 99.
This uses 58, 64, 32, 9. All numbers are used.
The equation is 58 + (64 - 32 + 9) = 99.
Let's check the order of operations.
58 + (64 - 32 + 9) = 58 + (32 + 9) = 58 + 41 = 99.
This is a valid solution.

Let's compare it to the first one: (64 - 32) + 9 + 58 = 99.
Both are valid. The second one is 58 + (64 - 32 + 9).

Let's try to get 99 by subtraction from a larger number.
For example, X - 58 = 99, so X = 157. Can I make 157 from 9, 32, 64?
9 * 32 = 288 (too big)
9 * 64 = 576 (too big)
32 * 64 (too big)
64 + 32 + 9 = 105 (no)

Let's try X - 64 = 99, so X = 163. Can I make 163 from 9, 32, 58?
9 * 32 = 288 (too big)
9 * 58 = 522 (too big)
32 * 58 (too big)
9 + 32 + 58 = 99 (no)

Let's try X - 32 = 99, so X = 131. Can I make 131 from 9, 64, 58?
9 * 64 = 576 (too big)
9 * 58 = 522 (too big)
64 + 58 + 9 = 131. Yes!
So, (64 + 58 + 9) - 32 = 131 - 32 = 99.
This uses 64, 58, 9, 32. All numbers are used.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create multiples of 10 or numbers that easily combine to 10.
3. Look for divisions that result in whole numbers.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: (68 - 20) / ?
68 - 20 = 48.
Can we get 48 / (44 / 6) or 48 / (44 + 6) or 48 / (44 - 6) or 48 / (6 - 44)?
44 / 6 is not a whole number.
44 + 6 = 50. 48 / 50 is not 10.
44 - 6 = 38. 48 / 38 is not 10.

Attempt 2: (68 + 20) / ?
68 + 20 = 88.
Can we get 88 / (44 / 6) or 88 / (44 + 6) or 88 / (44 - 6) or 88 / (6 - 44)?
44 / 6 is not a whole number.
44 + 6 = 50. 88 / 50 is not 10.
44 - 6 = 38. 88 / 38 is not 10.

Attempt 3: (68 * ?)
This will likely result in a large number, so we'd need division.

Attempt 4: Try to make 10 directly.
Maybe (20 / ?) + ?
20 / 4 = 5. We don't have 4.
20 / 2 = 10. We don't have 2.

Let's look at the numbers again: 68, 20, 44, 6.
Notice that 44 and 6 are close to multiples of 10 or can be combined to make numbers that are easy to work with.
44 + 6 = 50.
If we have 50, how can we get 10 using 68 and 20?
Maybe (68 + 20) / ? = 10? 88 / ? = 10. No.
Maybe (68 - 20) / ? = 10? 48 / ? = 10. No.

What if we use 50 (from 44+6) in a different way?
We have 68 and 20 left.
Can we make 50 from 68 and 20? No.

Let's try combining 68 and 20 first.
68 - 20 = 48.
We have 44 and 6 left.
Can we combine 44 and 6 to get something that works with 48 to make 10?
48 / (44/6) - not whole.
48 / (44+6) = 48/50 - no.
48 / (44-6) = 48/38 - no.
(48 / 44) * 6 - no.
(48 / 6) + 44 = 8 + 44 = 52 - no.
(48 / 6) - 44 = 8 - 44 = -36 - no.
44 - (48 / 6) = 44 - 8 = 36 - no.
44 + (48 / 6) = 44 + 8 = 52 - no.

Let's try combining 44 and 6 first.
44 + 6 = 50.
We have 68 and 20 left.
Can we combine 68 and 20 with 50 to get 10?
(68 + 20) / 50 = 88 / 50 - no.
(68 - 20) / 50 = 48 / 50 - no.
50 - (68 - 20) = 50 - 48 = 2 - no.
50 + (68 - 20) = 50 + 48 = 98 - no.
(68 - 50) + 20 = 18 + 20 = 38 - no.
(68 + 50) - 20 = 118 - 20 = 98 - no.
(20 + 50) - 68 = 70 - 68 = 2 - no.

Let's try 44 - 6 = 38.
We have 68 and 20 left.
(68 + 20) / 38 = 88 / 38 - no.
(68 - 20) / 38 = 48 / 38 - no.

Let's try 44 / ?
44 / 2 = 22. We don't have 2.
44 / 4 = 11. We don't have 4.

Let's try 20 / ?
20 / 4 = 5. We don't have 4.

Possible denominators: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Can we make 100 using three numbers?

(68 + 20) * ? = 100 -> 88 * ? = 100 (no)
(68 - 20) * ? = 100 -> 48 * ? = 100 (no)

Can we make 80 using three numbers?
68 + ? = 80 -> ? = 12 (don't have)
20 * 4 = 80. We have 20. Can we make 4 from 68, 44, 6?
(44 - 68) / 6 - no.
(68 - 44) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4. Yes!
So, we can make 4 from (68 - 44) / 6.
Then we can do 20 * 4 = 80.
The numbers used are 68, 44, 6, 20.
The result is 80. We need 10.

Let's rethink. We need the result to be 10.

5061,1164,"<think>The problem requires me to find an equation that sums to 54 using the numbers 58, 80, and 32 exactly once, and only the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let the numbers be $a = 58$, $b = 80$, and $c = 32$. I need to arrange these numbers with the operations to get 54.

I will explore different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c = 54$
2. $a \text{ op1 } (b \text{ op2 } c) = 54$

Let's try combinations:

**Attempt 1: Using addition and subtraction**
*   $58 + 80 - 32 = 138 - 32 = 106$ (Too high)
*   $58 - 80 + 32 = -22 + 32 = 10$ (Too low)
*   $80 + 58 - 32 = 138 - 32 = 106$ (Same as first)
*   $80 - 58 + 32 = 22 + 32 = 54$ (This works!)

Let's verify this:
$80 - 58 = 22$
$22 + 32 = 54$

This equation uses all three numbers (80, 58, 32) exactly once and only uses subtraction and addition.

Let's check other possibilities just to be thorough, although I've found a valid solution.

**Attempt 2: Using multiplication**
Multiplication will likely result in larger numbers, so I'll need to subtract significantly.
*   $58 * 80 = 4640$ (Very high)
*   $58 * 32 = 1856$ (Very high)
*   $80 * 32 = 2560$ (Very high)

If I multiply two numbers, the third number would need to be subtracted or divided.
Let's consider $80 * 32$. This is 2560. Subtracting 58 gives 2502. Dividing by 58 is not an integer.
Let's consider $58 * 32$. This is 1856. Subtracting 80 gives 1776.
Let's consider $58 * 80$. This is 4640. Subtracting 32 gives 4608.

What if I multiply one number by the result of an operation on the other two?
*   $58 * (80 - 32) = 58 * 48$ (Too high)
*   $58 * (80 + 32) = 58 * 112$ (Too high)
*   $80 * (58 - 32) = 80 * 26$ (Too high)
*   $80 * (58 + 32) = 80 * 90$ (Too high)
*   $32 * (58 - 80) = 32 * (-22)$ (Negative)
*   $32 * (80 - 58) = 32 * 22 = 704$ (Too high)

**Attempt 3: Using division**
Division might reduce numbers.
*   $80 / 32 = 2.5$
    *   $58 + 2.5 = 60.5$
    *   $58 - 2.5 = 55.5$
    *   $58 * 2.5 = 145$
    *   $58 / 2.5 = 23.2$
*   $58 / 32$ (Not an integer)
*   $80 / 58$ (Not an integer)
*   $32 / 80 = 0.4$
    *   $58 + 0.4 = 58.4$
    *   $58 - 0.4 = 57.6$
    *   $58 * 0.4 = 23.2$
    *   $58 / 0.4 = 145$
*   $32 / 58$ (Not an integer)
*   $58 / 80 = 0.725$

Let's try division as the last operation.
*   $(58 + 80) / 32 = 138 / 32$ (Not integer)
*   $(58 - 80) / 32 = -22 / 32$ (Negative)
*   $(80 - 58) / 32 = 22 / 32$ (Not integer)
*   $(80 + 32) / 58 = 112 / 58$ (Not integer)
*   $(58 + 32) / 80 = 90 / 80 = 1.125$
*   $(80 - 32) / 58 = 48 / 58$ (Not integer)

Let's try division as the first operation.
*   $80 / 32 = 2.5$. Then use 58.
    *   $58 + 2.5 = 60.5$
    *   $58 - 2.5 = 55.5$
    *   $58 * 2.5 = 145$
    *   $58 / 2.5 = 23.2$
*   $32 / 80 = 0.4$. Then use 58.
    *   $58 + 0.4 = 58.4$
    *   $58 - 0.4 = 57.6$
    *   $58 * 0.4 = 23.2$
    *   $58 / 0.4 = 145$

Let's try division as the middle operation.
*   $58 + (80 / 32) = 58 + 2.5 = 60.5$
*   $58 - (80 / 32) = 58 - 2.5 = 55.5$
*   $58 * (80 / 32) = 58 * 2.5 = 145$
*   $58 / (80 / 32) = 58 / 2.5 = 23.2$

*   $80 + (58 / 32)$ (Not integer)
*   $80 - (58 / 32)$ (Not integer)
*   $80 * (58 / 32)$ (Not integer)
*   $80 / (58 / 32) = 80 / 0.725$ (Not integer)

*   $32 + (80 / 58)$ (Not integer)
*   $32 - (80 / 58)$ (Not integer)
*   $32 * (80 / 58)$ (Not integer)
*   $32 / (80 / 58) = 32 / 1.379...$ (Not integer)

The simplest solution found is $80 - 58 + 32 = 54$. This satisfies all conditions.
The order of operations is from left to right for addition and subtraction.
$80 - 58 = 22$
$22 + 32 = 54$

Another possible order for the same operations:
$32 + 80 - 58 = 112 - 58 = 54$.
$80 + 32 - 58 = 112 - 58 = 54$.

The problem asks for *an* equation. $80 - 58 + 32 = 54$ is a valid solution.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Attempt 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(81 + 47) = 128. Need to get to 85 using 4 and 22. 128 - 22 - 4 = 102. Too high.
(81 - 47) = 34. Need to get to 85 using 4 and 22. 34 + 22 + 4 = 60. Too low.
(81 * 47) is too large.
(81 / 47) is not an integer.

Attempt 2: Try combining smaller numbers first.
(22 + 4) = 26. Need to get to 85 using 81 and 47.
26 + 81 - 47 = 60. Too low.
26 - 81 + 47 = -8. Not 85.
26 * 81 is too large.
26 / 81 is not useful.

(22 - 4) = 18. Need to get to 85 using 81 and 47.
18 + 81 - 47 = 52. Too low.
18 - 81 + 47 = -16. Not 85.

(22 * 4) = 88. Need to get to 85 using 81 and 47.
88 + 81 - 47 = 122. Too high.
88 - 81 + 47 = 54. Too low.
88 - (81 - 47) = 88 - 34 = 54. Too low.
88 - (81 + 47) = 88 - 128 = -40. Not 85.
(88 - 47) + 81 = 41 + 81 = 122. Too high.
(88 + 47) - 81 = 135 - 81 = 54. Too low.

Let's consider division.
Maybe one of the numbers can be used to divide another.
81 / ?
47 / ?
22 / ?
4 / ?

Let's try to get close to 85 with two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
81 + 4 = 85. We have 22 and 47 left. Can we make 0 from 22 and 47? No, not with one operation. (22-47) or (47-22) or (22*47) or (22/47) or (47/22).
So, 81 + 4 is not the direct path.

What if we use multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract?
Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 85.
(4 * 22) = 88. We have 81 and 47 left.
88 - (47 - 81) = 88 - (-34) = 122. No.
88 - (81 - 47) = 88 - 34 = 54. No.
88 + 47 - 81 = 135 - 81 = 54. No.
88 - 47 + 81 = 41 + 81 = 122. No.

Let's try another multiplication.
(4 * 47) = 188. We have 22 and 81 left.
188 - 81 - 22 = 105. Close, but not 85.
188 - (81 + 22) = 188 - 103 = 85. This works!
The numbers used are 4, 47, 81, 22. All used exactly once.
The operations are *, -, +.

Let's verify:
4 * 47 = 188
81 + 22 = 103
188 - 103 = 85.

The equation is (4 * 47) - (81 + 22) = 85.
This uses all numbers [4, 22, 81, 47] exactly once.
It uses multiplication, subtraction, and addition.

Let's check if there are other possibilities.
(4 * 81) = 324. Left with 22, 47.
324 - 22 - 47 = 255. No.
324 - (22 + 47) = 324 - 69 = 255. No.

(22 * 47) = 1034. Left with 4, 81. Too large.
(22 * 81) = 1782. Left with 4, 47. Too large.

What about division?
Maybe something like (X / Y) + Z + W = 85.
Or (X + Y) / Z + W = 85.

Let's try to make a number that divides nicely.
81 is divisible by 3, 9. None of the other numbers are 3 or 9.
22 is divisible by 2, 11. None of the other numbers are 2 or 11.
4 is divisible by 2.

(47 + 22) = 69. No.
(22 - 4) = 18. No.
(22 + 4) = 26. No.

Consider (22 / ?)
If we could make 2 or 11.
(47 - 4) = 43. No.
(47 - 81) = -34. No.
(81 - 47) = 34. No.
(81 - 4) = 77. No.

Consider (4 / ?)
If we could make 2.
(22 / ?)
(47 / ?)
(81 / ?)

Let's re-examine the successful attempt: (4 * 47) - (81 + 22) = 85.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to rearrange the terms.
Could it be (4 * 47) - 81 - 22 = 85? Yes, this is the same.
Could it be (4 * 47) - 22 - 81 = 85? Yes, this is the same.

What if the subtraction is applied differently?

1623,357,"<think>The problem asks for a single mathematical equation using the numbers [43, 4, 24, 56] exactly once, with operations +, -, *, /, to achieve a result of 78.

Let's list the numbers and the target:

Target: 78
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations to get 78. The order of operations matters, so I'll need to consider parentheses.

Let's try some combinations.

First, let's look at the numbers and the target. 78 is a relatively small number compared to some of the input numbers (like 56 and 43). This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the magnitude. Multiplication could increase it, so I need to be careful.

Let's try grouping the numbers in pairs and then combining the results.

Possible pairings and initial thoughts:
- 43 and 4: 43+4=47, 43-4=39, 43*4=172, 43/4 (not an integer)
- 43 and 24: 43+24=67, 43-24=19, 43*24=1032, 43/24 (not integer)

The results 6 and 14 from divisions seem promising as they are small.

Let's revisit the division results.

We saw 6 + 56 - 43 = 19.
We saw 6 + 43 + 56 = 105.
We saw 56 + 6 - 43 = 19.

I need to try different combinations of the numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 64, 24, 18.
Target: 22.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's try combining two numbers first and then using the third.

1.  (64 + 24) = 88. 88 ? 18 = 22. 88 - 18 = 70 (too high). 88 / 18 (not integer). 88 * 18 (too high).
2.  (64 - 24) = 40. 40 ? 18 = 22. 40 - 18 = 22. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 64, 24, 18 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: -, - (basic operations).
Result: 22.

The equation is (64 - 24) - 18 = 22.

Let's check other combinations just to be sure or if there are multiple solutions.

3.  (64 * 24) = 1536. 1536 ? 18 = 22. (Too large).
4.  (64 / 24) = 2.66... (Not integer, unlikely to lead to 22 easily).

5.  (24 + 18) = 42. 42 ? 64 = 22. 42 - 64 = -22 (close, but negative). 64 - 42 = 22. This also works!
    Equation: 64 - (24 + 18) = 22.
    Numbers used: 64, 24, 18.
    Operations used: -, +.
    Result: 22.

6.  (24 - 18) = 6. 6 ? 64 = 22. 64 - 6 = 58 (too high). 6 + 64 = 70 (too high).
7.  (24 * 18) = 432. 432 ? 64 = 22. (Too large).

9.  (64 + 18) = 82. 82 ? 24 = 22. 82 - 24 = 58 (too high).
10. (64 - 18) = 46. 46 ? 24 = 22. 46 - 24 = 22. This also works!

The problem asks for a single equation that evaluates to 94, using the numbers 73, 78, and 99 exactly once, with the allowed operations +, -, *, /.

Let the numbers be $a = 73$, $b = 78$, and $c = 99$. We need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to get 94.

We have three numbers, so we will have two operations. The possible structures are:
1. $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c$
2. $a \text{ op1 } (b \text{ op2 } c)$

Let's explore combinations systematically.

**Attempt 1: Start with multiplication or division as they tend to change the magnitude significantly.**

*   **Consider using 99 and 78 first.**
    *   $99 * 78$ is too large.
    *   $99 / 78$ is not an integer.
    *   $78 / 99$ is not an integer.
    *   $99 - 78 = 21$. Now we need to combine 21 and 73 to get 94.
        *   $21 + 73 = 94$. This looks promising!
        *   So, $(99 - 78) + 73 = 21 + 73 = 94$.
        *   This uses 99, 78, and 73 exactly once.
        *   The operations are subtraction and addition.
        *   This is a valid solution.

Let's verify this.
Equation: $(99 - 78) + 73$
Step 1: $99 - 78 = 21$
Step 2: $21 + 73 = 94$
This works.

**Let's continue exploring other possibilities to ensure thoroughness, even though we've found a solution.**

*   **Consider using 99 and 73 first.**
    *   $99 * 73$ is too large.
    *   $99 / 73$ is not an integer.
    *   $73 / 99$ is not an integer.
    *   $99 - 73 = 26$. Now combine 26 and 78 to get 94.
        *   $26 + 78 = 104$. Not 94.
        *   $78 - 26 = 52$. Not 94.
        *   $26 * 78$ is too large.
        *   $78 / 26 = 3$. Not 94.
    *   $99 + 73 = 172$. Now combine 172 and 78 to get 94.
        *   $172 - 78 = 94$. This also works!
        *   So, $(99 + 73) - 78 = 172 - 78 = 94$.
        *   This uses 99, 73, and 78 exactly once.
        *   The operations are addition and subtraction.
        *   This is another valid solution.

Let's verify this second solution.
Equation: $(99 + 73) - 78$
Step 1: $99 + 73 = 172$
Step 2: $172 - 78 = 94$
This also works.

The problem asks for *a* single equation. Both are valid. I will present the first one I found.

*   **Consider using 78 and 73 first.**
    *   $78 * 73$ is too large.
    *   $78 / 73$ is not an integer.
    *   $73 / 78$ is not an integer.
    *   $78 - 73 = 5$. Now combine 5 and 99 to get 94.
        *   $99 - 5 = 94$. This works!
        *   So, $99 - (78 - 73) = 99 - 5 = 94$.
        *   This uses 99, 78, and 73 exactly once.
        *   The operations are subtraction and subtraction.
        *   This is a third valid solution.

Let's verify this third solution.
Equation: $99 - (78 - 73)$
Step 1: $78 - 73 = 5$
Step 2: $99 - 5 = 94$
This also works.

    *   $78 + 73 = 151$. Now combine 151 and 99 to get 94.
        *   $151 - 99 = 52$. Not 94.
        *   $99 - 151$ is negative.
        *   $151 / 99$ is not integer.
        *   $99 / 151$ is not integer.

**Let's consider division involving larger numbers to see if we can get smaller intermediate results.**

*   **Can we get 94 by dividing a larger number by a smaller one?**
    *   We need to form a number that, when divided by one of the given numbers, results in something that can be combined with the third to make 94.
    *   For example, if we had $X / 73 = Y$, then $Y \text{ op } 78 = 94$.
    *   Or $X / 78 = Y$, then $Y \text{ op } 73 = 94$.
    *   Or $X / 99 = Y$, then $Y \text{ op } 73 = 94$.

*   **Let's try to make a number divisible by 73, 78, or 99.**
    *   Consider $78 * 99$. Too big.
    *   Consider $73 * 99$. Too big.
    *   Consider $73 * 78$. Too big.

*   **What if we use division to reduce numbers first?**
    *   $78 / ?$ or $99 / ?$ or $73 / ?$
    *   None of the numbers are easily divisible by each other to produce useful integers.
    *   $78 / 73$ (no)
    *   $78 / 99$ (no)
    *   $99 / 73$ (no)
    *   $99 / 78$ (no)
    *   $73 / 78$ (no)
    *   $73 / 99$ (no)

*   **Let's re-examine the structure $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c$.**
    *   We found $(99 - 78) + 73 = 94$.
    *   We found $(99 + 73) - 78 = 94$.
    *   We found $99 - (78 - 73) = 94$.

*   **Let's try the structure $a \text{ op1 } (b \text{ op2 } c)$.**
    *   $73 + (78 - 99)$ -> $73 + (-21) = 52$ (no)
    *   $73 - (78 - 99)$ -> $73 - (-21) = 94$. This works!
        *   $73 - (78 - 99) = 73 - (-21) = 73 + 21 = 94$.
        *   This uses 73, 78, and 99 exactly once.
        *   Operations are subtraction and subtraction.
        *   This is a fourth valid solution.

Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D or (A + B) * C / D.

Consider the numbers: 67, 44, 40, 65. Target: 64.
Notice 65 is close to 64. If we can make 1 from the other numbers, we can do 65 + 1.
Can we make 1 from 67, 44, 40?

23 + 40 + 65 = 128.
23 + 65 - 40 = 48.

2 * 40 = 80. Remaining 44. 80 - 44 = 36. 80 + 44 = 124.

4 + 67 - 65 = 6.
4 + 65 - 67 = 2.
4 * 67 = 268.
4 * 65 = 260.

Let's try multiplication first.
(44 * 65) / ? Too big.
(40 * 65) / ? Too big.
(44 * 40) / ? Too big.

What if we use division to reduce numbers?
(67 * 44) / 40? Not integer.

Try to get a number close to 64 using multiplication.

40 * 1 = 40. Need 24 from 67, 44, 65. (67 - 44) = 23. Close. (67 - 44) + 65 = 88. (67 - 44) - 65 = -42.
40 * 2 = 80. Need -16 from 67, 44, 65. (44 - 65) = -21. Close. (44 - 65) + 67 = 46. (44 - 65) - 67 = -88.
40 * 3 = 120. Need -56 from 67, 44, 65.

Let's look at the numbers again: 67, 44, 40, 65. Target: 64.
Notice 40 and 65. Their sum is 105. Their difference is 25.

5552,682,"<think>The target number is 16. The available numbers are 90, 30, 82, and 63. I need to use each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.

Let's try to combine the numbers in different ways.
The numbers are quite large, so division might be useful to reduce them.
90 / 30 = 3. This is a good start. Now I have 3, 82, and 63 to get 16.
Can I combine 82 and 63 to get something that, when combined with 3, results in 16?
82 + 63 = 145
82 - 63 = 19
63 - 82 = -19
82 * 63 = a very large number.
82 / 63 = not a whole number.
63 / 82 = not a whole number.

Let's try combining 3 with 19 (from 82 - 63).
3 + 19 = 22 (too high)
19 - 3 = 16 (perfect!)

So, the steps are:
1. Divide 90 by 30: 90 / 30 = 3
2. Subtract 63 from 82: 82 - 63 = 19
3. Subtract the result of step 1 from the result of step 2: 19 - 3 = 16

Let's put it all together: (82 - 63) - (90 / 30) = 19 - 3 = 16.
This uses all numbers [90, 30, 82, 63] exactly once and results in 16.

Let's check other combinations just to be sure.
What if I start with 82 and 63?
82 - 63 = 19. Now I have 19, 90, 30 to get 16.
19 + 90 + 30 = too big.
19 - 90 - 30 = negative.
19 + 90 - 30 = 79.
19 - 90 + 30 = -41.
19 * 90 / 30 = 19 * 3 = 57.
19 / 30 * 90 = not integer.
19 * 30 / 90 = 19 * 1/3 = not integer.

What if I start with 90 and 82?
90 - 82 = 8. Now I have 8, 30, 63 to get 16.
8 + 30 + 63 = too big.
8 + 30 - 63 = -25.
8 - 30 + 63 = 41.
8 * 30 / 63 = not integer.
8 * 63 / 30 = not integer.

What if I start with 90 and 63?
90 - 63 = 27. Now I have 27, 30, 82 to get 16.
27 + 30 - 82 = -25.
27 - 30 + 82 = 79.
27 * 30 / 82 = not integer.

What if I start with 30 and 82?
82 - 30 = 52. Now I have 52, 90, 63 to get 16.
52 + 90 - 63 = 79.
52 - 90 + 63 = 25.

What if I start with 30 and 63?
63 - 30 = 33. Now I have 33, 90, 82 to get 16.
33 + 90 - 82 = 41.
33 - 90 + 82 = 25.

The initial approach seems to be the most straightforward and successful.
(82 - 63) - (90 / 30) = 19 - 3 = 16.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try combining numbers to get something that divides nicely.

2666,798,"<think>
The user wants an equation that uses the numbers [12, 23, 76, 31] exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to produce the result 80.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 12, 23, 76, 31.
Target: 80.

Possible strategies:
1. Try to get close to 80 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.
2. Combine numbers in pairs and then combine the results.
3. Consider the order of operations carefully.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Start with larger numbers.
76 + 12 = 88. Need to get -8 from 23 and 31.
23 - 31 = -8.
So, (76 + 12) + (23 - 31) = 88 + (-8) = 80.
This uses all numbers and only allowed operations.

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 12, 23, 76, 31 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: +, -, + (allowed).
Result: 80.

This looks like a valid solution. I should double-check if there are other possibilities, but this one is straightforward and correct.

Let's try another path just to be sure.

Attempt 2: Multiplication might be involved.
12 * ?
23 * ?
76 * ?
31 * ?

If I multiply two numbers, the result might become too large or too small.
12 * 23 = 276 (too large)
12 * 31 = 372 (too large)
12 * 76 = 912 (too large)
23 * 31 = 713 (too large)
23 * 76 = 1748 (too large)
31 * 76 = 2356 (too large)

Division might be useful to reduce numbers.
76 / 12 = not an integer
76 / 23 = not an integer
76 / 31 = not an integer
31 / 12 = not an integer
31 / 23 = not an integer
23 / 12 = not an integer

What if I divide a sum or difference?
(76 + 12) / ? = 88 / ?
(76 - 12) / ? = 64 / ?
(76 + 23) / ? = 99 / ?
(76 - 23) / ? = 53 / ?
(76 + 31) / ? = 107 / ?
(76 - 31) / ? = 45 / ?

Let's go back to the first successful attempt.
(76 + 12) + (23 - 31) = 80.
This is a valid equation.

Let's consider alternative groupings for the same operations.
76 + 12 + 23 - 31 = 88 + 23 - 31 = 111 - 31 = 80.
This is also valid and uses the same numbers and operations. The order of operations (left to right for addition/subtraction) makes the parentheses optional here.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe subtraction from a larger intermediate number.
Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 80 and subtract.
76 + 31 = 107. Need to get -27 from 12 and 23.
12 - 23 = -11. Not -27.
23 - 12 = 11. Not -27.
12 * 23 = 276. Too large.
23 / 12 = not integer.
12 / 23 = not integer.

Let's try to make a number around 80 using multiplication and then adjust.
If I use division, it's likely to be at the end or to reduce a large number.
Consider (A * B) + C + D or (A * B) - C - D etc.
Let's try to get a number close to 80 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others.
If I multiply 12 by something, it's hard to get close to 80 with the remaining numbers.
12 * (something from 23, 76, 31)
If I use division:
(76 / 2) * ? - this is not allowed as 2 is not in the set.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution: (76 + 12) + (23 - 31) = 80.
This is clean and correct.

Let's try to see if multiplication can be used.
Suppose we have (A * B) + C + D.
If A=12, B=23, C=76, D=31. 12*23 + 76 + 31 = 276 + 76 + 31 = 383. Too big.
If A=12, B=31, C=76, D=23. 12*31 + 76 + 23 = 372 + 76 + 23 = 471. Too big.
If A=12, B=76, C=23, D=31. 12*76 + 23 + 31 = 912 + 23 + 31 = 966. Too big.

What about (A * B) - C - D?
12 * 23 - 76 - 31 = 276 - 76 - 31 = 200 - 31 = 169.
12 * 31 - 76 - 23 = 372 - 76 - 23 = 296 - 23 = 273.
12 * 76 - 23 - 31 = 912 - 23 - 31 = 889 - 31 = 858.

What about (A + B) * C + D?
(12 + 23) * 76 + 31 = 35 * 76 + 31 = 2660 + 31 = 2691.

What about (A - B) * C + D?
(76 - 12) * 23 + 31 = 64 * 23 + 31 = 1472 + 31 = 1503.

What about division?
Maybe something like (A + B + C) / D?

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe we can get a number close to 18 and adjust.

Consider (97 - 83) = 14. We need 4 from 23 and 36.
What if we do something like (A - B) + (C - D)?
(97 - 83) + (36 - 23) = 14 + 13 = 27 (not 18)
(97 - 36) + (83 - 23) = 61 + 60 = 121 (not 18)

771,596,"<think>The problem requires me to create a single mathematical equation that evaluates to 61. I must use each number from the set [7, 9, 7, 14] exactly once. The allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: 7, 9, 7, 14.
The target value is 61.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to reach 61. I should consider different groupings and orders of operations.

Let's start by trying to combine pairs of numbers and see what intermediate results I get.

Possible pairs and operations:
7 + 9 = 16
7 - 9 = -2
9 - 7 = 2
7 * 9 = 63
7 / 9 (not an integer, might be tricky)
9 / 7 (not an integer)

7 + 7 = 14
7 - 7 = 0
7 * 7 = 49
7 / 7 = 1

7 + 14 = 21
14 - 7 = 7
7 * 14 = 98
14 / 7 = 2

9 + 7 = 16
9 - 7 = 2
9 * 7 = 63
9 / 7 (not an integer)

9 + 14 = 23
14 - 9 = 5
9 * 14 = 126
14 / 9 (not an integer)

14 + 7 = 21
14 - 7 = 7
14 * 7 = 98
14 / 7 = 2

Now I have intermediate results and need to combine them with the remaining numbers.

Let's try to get close to 61.
The number 63 (from 7 * 9) is very close to 61.
If I use 7 * 9 = 63, the remaining numbers are 7 and 14.
I need to combine 63 with 7 and 14 to get 61.
Possible combinations:
63 + 7 + 14 = 84 (too high)
63 - 7 - 14 = 63 - 21 = 42 (too low)
63 + 7 - 14 = 70 - 14 = 56 (close)
63 - 7 + 14 = 56 + 14 = 70 (too high)
63 + 14 - 7 = 77 - 7 = 70 (too high)
63 - 14 + 7 = 49 + 7 = 56 (close)

What if I subtract something from 63?
63 - (something using 7 and 14)
63 - (7 + 14) = 63 - 21 = 42
63 - (14 - 7) = 63 - 7 = 56
63 - (7 * 14) = 63 - 98 (negative)
63 - (14 / 7) = 63 - 2 = 61. This looks promising!

Let's check if this uses all numbers exactly once.
The expression is (7 * 9) - (14 / 7).
Numbers used: 7, 9, 14, 7.
This uses the number 7 twice, which is allowed as it appears twice in the set [7, 9, 7, 14].
The numbers used are 7, 9, 14, and the second 7. All numbers from the set are used exactly once.
The operations used are multiplication, subtraction, and division.

Let's verify the calculation:
(7 * 9) - (14 / 7)
= 63 - 2
= 61

This equation works.

Let's explore other possibilities to be sure or to see if there are simpler ones, though this one seems quite direct.

What if I start with 14 * 7 = 98? Remaining numbers are 7 and 9.
98 - 7 - 9 = 98 - 16 = 82
98 - (7 + 9) = 98 - 16 = 82
98 - (9 - 7) = 98 - 2 = 96
98 - (7 * 9) = 98 - 63 = 35

What if I start with 7 * 7 = 49? Remaining numbers are 9 and 14.
49 + 9 + 14 = 49 + 23 = 72
49 + 14 - 9 = 63 - 9 = 54
49 + 9 - 14 = 58 - 14 = 44
49 + (14 - 9) = 49 + 5 = 54
49 + (9 * 14) = 49 + 126 (too high)
49 + (14 / 9) (not integer)
49 - (14 - 9) = 49 - 5 = 44
49 - (9 - 14) = 49 - (-5) = 54
49 + (14/?) - 9
49 + 14 = 63. Remaining is 9. 63 - 9 = 54.
49 + 9 = 58. Remaining is 14. 58 - 14 = 44.

Let's consider division first.
14 / 7 = 2. Remaining numbers are 7 and 9.
We need to get 61 from 2, 7, 9.
2 * 7 * 9 = 14 * 9 = 126 (too high)
2 + 7 + 9 = 18 (too low)
2 * 9 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25
2 * 7 + 9 = 14 + 9 = 23
(2 + 7) * 9 = 9 * 9 = 81
(2 + 9) * 7 = 11 * 7 = 77
(7 + 9) * 2 = 16 * 2 = 32
2 * (7 + 9) = 32
2 * (9 - 7) = 2 * 2 = 4
(9 - 7) * 2 = 4
2 + (7 * 9) = 2 + 63 = 65 (close)
(14 / 7) + (7 * 9) = 2 + 63 = 65. This uses 14, 7, 7, 9. All numbers used. Result is 65, not 61.

Let's revisit the first successful attempt: (7 * 9) - (14 / 7).
Numbers: 7, 9, 14, 7.
Operations: *, -, /.
Result: 61.

Let's try another structure. Maybe addition of two products?
(7 * 7) + (9 * ?) - no, only 14 left. (7*7) + (9*14) = 49 + 126 (too high)
(7 * 9) + (7 * 14) = 63 + 98 (too high)

Maybe a product minus a sum?
(7 * 14) - (7 + 9) = 98 - 16 = 82
(7 * 9) - (7 + 14) = 63 - 21 = 42

Maybe a sum minus a product?
(7 + 14) - (7 * 9) = 21 - 63 (negative)

Let's consider the numbers again: 7, 9, 7, 14. Target: 61.
The number 63 from 7 * 9 is a strong candidate.
We need to adjust 63 by -2.
How can we get -2 from 7 and 14?
7 - 14 = -7
14 - 7 = 7
7 / 14 = 0.5
14 / 7 = 2.
So, if we have 63, and we want to subtract 2, we can use 14 / 7.
This leads to (7 * 9) - (14 / 7).
Numbers used: 7, 9, 14, 7. All are used.

Let's list the numbers: 71, 57, 9, 97.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations.
The order of operations matters, so I'll consider parentheses.

Let's try to get close to 78.
The numbers are roughly around 70, 60, 10, 100.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest number (97) and adjust.
2. Combine smaller numbers to get a value that can be combined with larger ones.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers close to 78 or factors of numbers that could lead to 78.

This pairwise approach doesn't immediately yield obvious paths.

Let's try to build towards 78.
Maybe a large number minus something, or a smaller number plus something.

The user wants a single mathematical equation using the numbers 14, 10, and 81 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /. The target result is 57.

Let's list the numbers: {14, 10, 81}.
Target: 57.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the 4 types. This gives a large number of possibilities, but I can try to be strategic.

Let's consider the magnitude of the numbers. 81 is the largest. 57 is smaller than 81. This suggests that 81 might be involved in a subtraction or division that reduces its value significantly, or it might be part of a larger expression that is then subtracted from.

Let's try some combinations systematically.

Possibility 1: Start with 81.
*   81 - ? = 57. The difference is 81 - 57 = 24. Can I make 24 from 14 and 10?
    *   14 + 10 = 24. Yes!

        *   Numbers used: 81, 14, 10 (all used once).
        *   Operations used: -, + (fundamental arithmetic operations).

        *   Equation: 81 - (14 + 10) = 57. This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough and ensure this is the most straightforward or to confirm no other simple combinations exist.

Possibility 2: Start with 14.
*   14 + ? = 57. Need 43. Can I make 43 from 10 and 81?
    *   81 - 10 = 71 (too large)

Let's consider combinations involving multiplication or division more directly.

    *   140 / 81 (not integer)
    *   81 / 140 (not integer)
    *   140 * 81 (too large)

1832,913,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 17, 43, 60, and 50 exactly once, along with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to arrive at the target value of 72.

I need to explore different combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations. The order of operations matters, so I'll need to consider parentheses as well.

Let's list the numbers: {17, 43, 60, 50}. Target: 72.

**Initial thoughts and strategies:**
1.  **Look for numbers that can easily get close to 72.**
    *   60 is close to 72. I need to add 12. Can I make 12 from {17, 43, 50}?
        *   50 - 43 = 7. Not 12.
        *   50 - 17 = 33. Not 12.
        *   43 - 17 = 26. Not 12.
        *   17 + 43 = 60. Not 12.
        *   17 + 50 = 67. Not 12.
        *   43 + 50 = 93. Not 12.
        *   Combinations involving division or multiplication seem unlikely to produce a small integer like 12 from these numbers. For example, 50/17 is not an integer. 43/17 is not an integer. 50/43 is not an integer. 17*43 is too large. 17*50 is too large. 43*50 is too large.
    *   50 is also somewhat close. I need to add 22. Can I make 22 from {17, 43, 60}?
        *   60 - 43 = 17. Not 22.
        *   60 - 17 = 43. Not 22.
        *   43 - 17 = 26. Not 22.
        *   17 + 43 = 60. Not 22.
        *   17 + 60 = 77. Not 22.
        *   43 + 60 = 103. Not 22.
    *   17 is far from 72.
    *   43 is far from 72.

2.  **Consider multiplication as a way to increase values.**
    *   What if I multiply two numbers and then adjust with the others?
    *   Let's try multiplying the largest numbers first.
        *   60 * 50 = 3000 (too large)
        *   60 * 43 = 2580 (too large)
        *   60 * 17 = 1020 (too large)
        *   50 * 43 = 2150 (too large)
        *   50 * 17 = 850 (too large)
        *   43 * 17 = 731 (too large)
    *   This suggests that direct multiplication of two numbers might not be the primary operation to get close to 72, unless it's followed by significant division.

3.  **Consider division.** Division can reduce large numbers.
    *   Can I create a large number that, when divided by one of the remaining numbers, gets close to 72?
    *   Let's try to make a number around 72 * X, where X is one of the numbers.
        *   72 * 17 = 1224
        *   72 * 43 = 3096
        *   72 * 50 = 3600
        *   72 * 60 = 4320
    *   Can I form any of these large numbers from the remaining three? This seems unlikely.

4.  **Let's try combining numbers in pairs and then operating on the results.**
    *   (60 + 50) = 110. Remaining: {17, 43}. 110 + 17 + 43 = 170. 110 - 17 - 43 = 50. 110 + 17 - 43 = 84. 110 - 17 + 43 = 136. 110 * 17 = 1870. 110 / 17 (not integer). 110 * 43 = 4730. 110 / 43 (not integer).

    *   (60 + 43) = 103. Remaining: {17, 50}. 103 + 17 + 50 = 170. 103 - 17 - 50 = 36. 103 + 17 - 50 = 70. Close! 103 - 17 + 50 = 136.
    *   (60 - 43) = 17. Remaining: {17, 50}. 17 + 17 + 50 = 84. 17 + 17 - 50 = -16. 17 - 17 + 50 = 50. 17 - 17 - 50 = -50. 17 * 17 = 289. 17 * 50 = 850.
    *   (60 + 17) = 77. Remaining: {43, 50}. 77 + 43 + 50 = 170. 77 - 43 - 50 = -16. 77 + 43 - 50 = 70. Close! 77 - 43 + 50 = 84.
    *   (60 - 17) = 43. Remaining: {43, 50}. 43 + 43 + 50 = 136. 43 + 43 - 50 = 36. 43 - 43 + 50 = 50. 43 - 43 - 50 = -50.
    *   (50 + 43) = 93. Remaining: {17, 60}. 93 + 17 + 60 = 170. 93 - 17 - 60 = 16. 93 + 17 - 60 = 50. 93 - 17 + 60 = 136.
    *   (50 - 43) = 7. Remaining: {17, 60}. 7 + 17 + 60 = 84. 7 + 17 - 60 = -36. 7 - 17 + 60 = 50. 7 - 17 - 60 = -70. 7 * 17 = 119. 7 * 60 = 420.
    *   (50 + 17) = 67. Remaining: {43, 60}. 67 + 43 + 60 = 170. 67 - 43 - 60 = -36. 67 + 43 - 60 = 50. 67 - 43 + 60 = 84.
    *   (50 - 17) = 33. Remaining: {43, 60}. 33 + 43 + 60 = 136. 33 + 43 - 60 = 16. 33 - 43 + 60 = 50. 33 - 43 - 60 = -70.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 75, 28, 53, and 19 that evaluates to 55.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Start with the largest number, 75.
    *   75 - ? = 55. This means the remaining numbers must combine to 20.
        *   Numbers left: [28, 53, 19].

3983,790,"<think>The problem asks us to combine the numbers 85, 88, and 76 using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get the result 73. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let the numbers be $a = 85$, $b = 88$, and $c = 76$. We need to find an expression of the form $a \ op_1 \ b \ op_2 \ c$ or $a \ op_1 \ (b \ op_2 \ c)$ or $(a \ op_1 \ b) \ op_2 \ c$, where $op_1$ and $op_2$ are from $\{+, -, *, /\}$ and the result is 73.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Using all numbers in a linear fashion.
Try starting with the largest numbers.
$88 - 85 = 3$. Then $3 \ op_2 \ 76$. $3 + 76 = 79$ (too high). $76 - 3 = 73$. This works!
So, $(88 - 85) - 76$ is not correct because it would be $3 - 76 = -73$.
We need $76 - (88 - 85)$.
Let's check the order of operations.
If we write $88 - 85 - 76$, it means $(88 - 85) - 76 = 3 - 76 = -73$.
If we write $88 - (85 - 76)$, it means $88 - 9 = 79$.
If we write $76 - (88 - 85)$, it means $76 - 3 = 73$. This is a valid expression.

Let's verify the numbers used: 85, 88, 76. All used exactly once.
Operations used: subtraction. Allowed.
Result: 73. Correct.

Let's explore other possibilities to be sure.

Possibility 2: Multiplication involved.
$85 * 88$ is very large.
$85 * 76$ is very large.
$88 * 76$ is very large.

What about division?
$88 / 85$ is not an integer.
$85 / 88$ is not an integer.
$88 / 76$ is not an integer.
$76 / 88$ is not an integer.
$85 / 76$ is not an integer.
$76 / 85$ is not an integer.

This suggests that division might be used in a way that results in an integer, or it might be the last operation.

Let's consider expressions like $(a \ op_1 \ b) \ op_2 \ c$.
We found $(88 - 85) - 76 = -73$.
We found $76 - (88 - 85) = 73$. This is a valid solution.

Let's try other pairings.
$85 + 88 = 173$. $173 \ op_2 \ 76$. $173 - 76 = 97$. $173 + 76 = 249$.
$85 - 88 = -3$. $-3 \ op_2 \ 76$. $-3 + 76 = 73$. This works!
So, $85 - 88 + 76$. Let's check the order of operations.
$85 - 88 + 76 = (85 - 88) + 76 = -3 + 76 = 73$.
Numbers used: 85, 88, 76. All used exactly once.
Operations used: subtraction, addition. Allowed.
Result: 73. Correct.

This is another valid solution. The problem asks for ""a valid arithmetic expression"". Either one is fine.
Let's stick with the first one found as it was a direct path.

Let's re-verify $76 - (88 - 85)$.
Numbers: 76, 88, 85. Used once.
Operations: -, -. Allowed.
Calculation: $88 - 85 = 3$. $76 - 3 = 73$. Correct.

Let's re-verify $85 - 88 + 76$.
Numbers: 85, 88, 76. Used once.
Operations: -, +. Allowed.
Calculation: $85 - 88 = -3$. $-3 + 76 = 73$. Correct.

Both are valid. I will present one of them. The second one is slightly simpler in terms of parenthesis.

Let's try to see if division can be used.
Suppose division is the last operation.
$(a \ op_1 \ b) / c = 73$.
$(85 \ op_1 \ 88) / 76 = 73$. The numerator would be $73 * 76$, which is large.
$(85 \ op_1 \ 76) / 88 = 73$. The numerator would be $73 * 88$, which is large.
$(88 \ op_1 \ 76) / 85 = 73$. The numerator would be $73 * 85$, which is large.

Suppose division is the first operation.
$a / b \ op_2 \ c = 73$.
$85 / 88 \ op_2 \ 76$. This will involve fractions.
$88 / 85 \ op_2 \ 76$. This will involve fractions.
$88 / 76 \ op_2 \ 85$. This will involve fractions.

What if division results in an integer?
The only possible integer division from these numbers is if we can form a multiple.
For example, if we had 10 and 5, $10/5 = 2$.
Here, no number is a direct divisor of another.

Let's consider intermediate results that could be divisible.
For example, if we had $(85+88)$ and then divided by something.
$85+88 = 173$. Not divisible by 76.
$85-88 = -3$. Not divisible by 76.
$88-85 = 3$. Not divisible by 76.
$85*88$ is large.

Let's consider the structure $(a \ op_1 \ b) \ op_2 \ c$.
We found $85 - 88 + 76 = 73$.
We found $76 - (88 - 85) = 73$.

Let's try other combinations for $85 - 88 + 76$.
Could it be $85 + 76 - 88$?
$85 + 76 = 161$. $161 - 88 = 73$. This is also valid.
Numbers: 85, 76, 88. Used once.
Operations: +, -. Allowed.
Result: 73. Correct.

Could it be $76 + 85 - 88$?
$76 + 85 = 161$. $161 - 88 = 73$. This is also valid.

Could it be $76 - 88 + 85$?
$76 - 88 = -12$. $-12 + 85 = 73$. This is also valid.

Could it be $88 - 76 + 85$?
$88 - 76 = 12$. $12 + 85 = 97$. Incorrect.

Could it be $88 + 85 - 76$?
$88 + 85 = 173$. $173 - 76 = 97$. Incorrect.

Could it be $88 - 85 + 76$?
$88 - 85 = 3$. $3 + 76 = 79$. Incorrect.

So, the valid expressions found so far are:
1. $76 - (88 - 85)$
2. $85 - 88 + 76$
3. $85 + 76 - 88$
4. $76 + 85 - 88$
5. $76 - 88 + 85$

All these expressions use the numbers 85, 88, and 76 exactly once and result in 73.
The problem asks for ""a valid arithmetic expression"". I will choose one of the simpler ones.
$85 - 88 + 76$ is a good candidate.

The problem asks me to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers [67, 50, 63] exactly once, with the allowed operations being addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), to reach a target value of 54.

I need to explore combinations of these three numbers and the four operations. Since there are only three numbers, the number of possible expressions is manageable. I can think of this as placing operators between the numbers and considering the order of operations (parentheses).

Let the numbers be N1 = 67, N2 = 50, N3 = 63. The target is T = 54.

Possible structures for expressions with three numbers:
1. (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3
2. N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Let's list the numbers and the target again: [67, 50, 63], Target = 54.

Let's try different permutations of the numbers and operations.

So far, I have two potential solutions:
1. (67 + 50) - 63 = 54
2. 67 + (50 - 63) = 54

Let's check these against the requirements.
Solution 1: (67 + 50) - 63
- Uses numbers: 67, 50, 63. Yes.
- Uses each number exactly once: Yes.
- Uses only allowed operations (+, -): Yes.
- Evaluates to target 54: (67 + 50) - 63 = 117 - 63 = 54. Yes.

Solution 2: 67 + (50 - 63)
- Uses numbers: 67, 50, 63. Yes.
- Uses each number exactly once: Yes.
- Uses only allowed operations (+, -): Yes.
- Evaluates to target 54: 67 + (50 - 63) = 67 + (-13) = 54. Yes.

Both are valid. The problem asks for ""an"" equation, so either is fine. I'll pick the first one as it might be slightly more straightforward in terms of calculation flow.

Let's quickly check other permutations of numbers to be thorough, although I've already found valid solutions.

Structure 1: (67 op1 63) op2 50
   - (67 + 63) + 50 = 130 + 50 = 180
   - (67 + 63) - 50 = 130 - 50 = 80
   - (67 - 63) + 50 = 4 + 50 = 54 (Found another potential solution!)
   - (67 - 63) - 50 = 4 - 50 = -46
   - (67 * 63) ... (too high)
   - (67 / 63) ... (not integer)

Structure 2: 67 op1 (63 op2 50)
   - 67 + (63 + 50) = 67 + 113 = 180
   - 67 + (63 - 50) = 67 + 13 = 80
   - 67 - (63 + 50) = 67 - 113 = -46
   - 67 - (63 - 50) = 67 - 13 = 54 (Found another potential solution!)

So, (67 - 63) + 50 = 54 and 67 - (63 - 50) = 54 are also valid.

962,722,"<think>The problem requires me to create a single mathematical equation using the numbers 8, 12, 46, and 17 exactly once. The equation must evaluate to 62, and I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

My strategy will be to systematically explore combinations of operations and number placements. I'll start by considering the larger numbers and how they might interact to get close to 62.

The numbers are: 8, 12, 46, 17. Target: 62.

Let's consider the largest number, 46.
How can I get from 46 to 62 using the other numbers (8, 12, 17)?
62 - 46 = 16. Can I make 16 from 8, 12, 17?
Possible combinations for 16:
- 17 - 1 = 16 (Need to make 1 from 8 and 12. Not possible with basic ops).
- 12 + 4 = 16 (Need to make 4 from 8 and 17. Not possible).
- 8 + 8 = 16 (Can't use 8 twice).
- 17 - 8 + ? = 16 (9 + ? = 16, ? = 7. Can't make 7 from 12).
- 12 + 8 - ? = 16 (20 - ? = 16, ? = 4. Can't make 4 from 17).
- 17 + 12 - ? = 16 (29 - ? = 16, ? = 13. Can't make 13 from 8).
- 17 - 12 + ? = 16 (5 + ? = 16, ? = 11. Can't make 11 from 8).

This suggests that 46 might not be directly added or subtracted to get to 62. It might be part of a multiplication or division.

Let's try using multiplication with the smaller numbers to get closer to 62.
- 8 * 12 = 96. Too high.
- 8 * 17 = 136. Too high.
- 12 * 17 = 204. Too high.

What if 46 is multiplied by something small?
- 46 * (something) = 62. Not likely with integers.

What if 46 is divided?
- 46 / 8 = 5.75
- 46 / 12 = 3.83...
- 46 / 17 = 2.70...

Let's try combining numbers first and then operating with 46.
Consider combinations of two numbers:

    - 63 / 8 ... (Too low)
    - 63 * 12 ... (Too high)
    - 63 / 12 ... (Too low)

Let's try combining three numbers.
Consider (46 + 17) = 63. We need to get to 62 using 8 and 12.
63 - (something from 8 and 12) = 62.
This means (something from 8 and 12) must equal 1.
Can we make 1 from 8 and 12?
- 12 / 8 = 1.5
- 8 / 12 = 0.66...
- 12 - 8 = 4
- 8 - 12 = -4
- 12 + 8 = 20
- 12 * 8 = 96
No, we cannot make exactly 1 from 8 and 12 using basic operations.

Consider (46 - 12) = 34. Remaining: 8, 17. Target: 62.
- 34 + 8 + 17 = 59 (Close)
- 34 + 17 - 8 = 43
- 34 + 8 * 17 = 34 + 136 = 170
- 34 + 17 / 8 = 34 + 2.125 = 36.125

5387,1419,"<think>The numbers are [90, 79, 80, 3] and the target is 47. I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite large, so division or subtraction might be key to getting a smaller number like 47.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with a large number and subtract others.
2. Combine smaller numbers to subtract from a larger one.
3. Use multiplication to get closer to the target, then adjust.

Let's try using 90.
90 - ? = 47. This means ? = 90 - 47 = 43.
Can I make 43 from [79, 80, 3]?
79 - 80 + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2 (no)
80 - 79 + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 (no)
79 + 3 - 80 = 82 - 80 = 2 (no)
80 + 3 - 79 = 83 - 79 = 4 (no)
(80 - 79) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3 (no)
(79 - 3) - 80 = 76 - 80 = -4 (no)
(80 - 3) - 79 = 77 - 79 = -2 (no)
79 / 3 is not an integer.
80 / 3 is not an integer.
79 * 3 = 237 (too big)
80 * 3 = 240 (too big)

Let's try using 79.
79 - ? = 47. This means ? = 79 - 47 = 32.
Can I make 32 from [90, 80, 3]?
90 - 80 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 (no)
80 - 90 + 3 = -10 + 3 = -7 (no)
(90 - 80) * 3 = 10 * 3 = 30 (close!)
Can I adjust this? (90 - 80) * 3 = 30. I need 32.
What if I add 3 to 30? That would be 33.
What if I subtract 3 from 30? That would be 27.
What if I use 3 differently?
90 - (80 + 3) = 90 - 83 = 7 (no)
90 - (80 - 3) = 90 - 77 = 13 (no)
(90 + 3) - 80 = 93 - 80 = 13 (no)
(80 + 3) - 90 = 83 - 90 = -7 (no)

Let's try using 80.
80 - ? = 47. This means ? = 80 - 47 = 33.
Can I make 33 from [90, 79, 3]?
90 - 79 + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 (no)
79 - 90 + 3 = -11 + 3 = -8 (no)
(90 - 79) * 3 = 11 * 3 = 33. This works!
So, 80 - ((90 - 79) * 3) = 80 - (11 * 3) = 80 - 33 = 47.
This uses all numbers [90, 79, 80, 3] exactly once.

Let's double check the order of operations.
80 - ((90 - 79) * 3)
Parentheses first: 90 - 79 = 11
Then multiplication: 11 * 3 = 33
Then subtraction: 80 - 33 = 47.

This looks correct.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.
What about division?
90 / 3 = 30. Remaining numbers are [79, 80]. Target is 47.
Can I make 47 from [79, 80] and 30?
30 + 79 - 80 = 109 - 80 = 29 (no)
30 + 80 - 79 = 110 - 79 = 31 (no)
30 - 79 + 80 = -49 + 80 = 31 (no)
30 - 80 + 79 = -50 + 79 = 29 (no)
(79 - 80) * 30 = -1 * 30 = -30 (no)
(80 - 79) * 30 = 1 * 30 = 30 (no)

80 / ?
80 / 3 is not integer.
80 / 79 is not integer.
80 / 90 is not integer.

79 / ?
79 / 3 is not integer.
79 / 80 is not integer.
79 / 90 is not integer.

Let's try multiplication first.
3 * 79 = 237 (too big)
3 * 80 = 240 (too big)
3 * 90 = 270 (too big)

What if we combine numbers to get a number that divides nicely?
(79+3) = 82. 82 / ?
(80+3) = 83. 83 / ?
(90+3) = 93. 93 / ?
(79-3) = 76. 76 / ?
(80-3) = 77. 77 / ?
(90-3) = 87. 87 / ?

Let's re-examine the solution found: 80 - ((90 - 79) * 3) = 47.
This is a valid solution.

Could there be another one?
Let's try starting with a sum.
90 + 79 = 169. Need to get to 47 using 80 and 3.
169 - 80 - 3 = 89 - 3 = 86 (no)
169 - (80 + 3) = 169 - 83 = 86 (no)
169 - (80 * 3) = 169 - 240 (negative)

90 + 80 = 170. Need to get to 47 using 79 and 3.
170 - 79 - 3 = 91 - 3 = 88 (no)
170 - (79 + 3) = 170 - 82 = 88 (no)
170 - (79 * 3) = 170 - 237 (negative)

90 + 3 = 93. Need to get to 47 using 79 and 80.
93 - 79 + 80 = 14 + 80 = 94 (no)
93 + 80 - 79 = 173 - 79 = 94 (no)
93 - (80 - 79) = 93 - 1 = 92 (no)
93 - (80 + 79) = 93 - 159 (negative)

Let's try subtraction from a larger number again.
We tried 90 - ?, 79 - ?, 80 - ?.
What about combining numbers to subtract from a larger one?
(90+79) - (80+3) = 169 - 83 = 86 (no)
(90+80) - (79+3) = 170 - 82 = 88 (no)
(90+3) - (80+79) = 93 - 159 (negative)

What about division in the final step?
? / ? = 47.
This would require one of the numbers to be a multiple of 47, or a combination to be a multiple of 47.

(80 + 42) + 35 - 8 = 122 + 35 - 8 = 157 - 8 = 149 (Too high)
(80 - 42) + 35 + 8 = 38 + 35 + 8 = 73 + 8 = 81 (Too low)
(80 - 42) - 35 + 8 = 38 - 35 + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11 (Too low)

Attempt 2: Using multiplication.
Maybe multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the others.
42 * 8 = 336 (Too high to easily get to 88)
42 * 35 (Very high)
42 * 80 (Very high)
80 * 8 = 640 (Too high)
80 * 35 (Very high)
35 * 8 = 280 (Too high)

Let's try division.
80 / 8 = 10. Now I have 10, 42, 35. Target 88.
10 + 42 + 35 = 87 (Close!)
10 + 42 - 35 = 17
10 - 42 + 35 = 3
10 * 42 = 420
10 * 35 = 350
42 / 35 (Not a whole number)
35 / 42 (Not a whole number)

Let's revisit 80 / 8 = 10. Numbers are 10, 42, 35. Target 88.
We got 10 + 42 + 35 = 87. We need 88.
This means the combination (80/8) + 42 + 35 is very close.
How can I get +1 more?
Maybe rearrange the last two numbers?
(80 / 8) + 35 + 42 = 10 + 35 + 42 = 87. Still 87.

Let's try another division.
42 / ? (Not obvious)
35 / ? (Not obvious)
8 / ? (Not obvious)

Let's try combining numbers to get something that can be multiplied or added to get 88.
Maybe (42 + 8) = 50. Numbers left: 80, 35. Target 88.
50 + 80 - 35 = 130 - 35 = 95 (Close)
50 - 80 + 35 = -30 + 35 = 5
50 + 35 - 80 = 85 - 80 = 5

Maybe (42 - 8) = 34. Numbers left: 80, 35. Target 88.
34 + 80 - 35 = 114 - 35 = 79
34 - 80 + 35 = -46 + 35 = -11

Maybe (80 - 35) = 45. Numbers left: 42, 8. Target 88.
45 + 42 + 8 = 87 + 8 = 95
45 + 42 - 8 = 87 - 8 = 79
45 - 42 + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11

Maybe (80 + 35) = 115. Numbers left: 42, 8. Target 88.
115 - 42 + 8 = 73 + 8 = 81
115 - 42 - 8 = 73 - 8 = 65

Let's try multiplication with addition/subtraction.
What if we multiply two numbers and add/subtract the result of the other two?
(42 * 8) + (80 - 35) = 336 + 45 (Too high)
(42 * 8) - (80 - 35) = 336 - 45 (Too high)
(42 * 8) + (35 - 80) = 336 - 45 (Too high)

(80 * 8) + (42 - 35) = 640 + 7 (Too high)
(80 * 8) - (42 - 35) = 640 - 7 (Too high)

(35 * 8) + (80 - 42) = 280 + 38 (Too high)

Let's try division again.
80 / 42 (Not whole)
80 / 35 (Not whole)
80 / 8 = 10. Numbers: 10, 42, 35. Target 88.
We had 10 + 42 + 35 = 87.

What if we use multiplication on one of the results?
(80 / 8) * ?
(80 / 8) * 42 = 10 * 42 = 420 (Too high)
(80 / 8) * 35 = 10 * 35 = 350 (Too high)

Let's try a different structure.
Maybe (A + B) * C + D or (A - B) * C + D.

Consider (42 + 8) = 50. Numbers left: 80, 35. Target 88.
50 + 80 - 35 = 95.
50 - 35 + 80 = 15 + 80 = 95.

Consider (42 - 8) = 34. Numbers left: 80, 35. Target 88.
34 + 80 - 35 = 79.

Consider (80 - 42) = 38. Numbers left: 35, 8. Target 88.
38 + 35 + 8 = 81.
38 + 35 - 8 = 65.
38 - 35 + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11.

Consider (80 - 35) = 45. Numbers left: 42, 8. Target 88.
45 + 42 + 8 = 95.
45 + 42 - 8 = 79.
45 - 42 + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11.

Consider (35 - 8) = 27. Numbers left: 42, 80. Target 88.
27 + 42 + 80 = 149.
27 + 80 - 42 = 107 - 42 = 65.
27 - 42 + 80 = -15 + 80 = 65.

Let's try multiplication with addition/subtraction of the remaining numbers.
(42 * 8) = 336. Left: 80, 35.
(42 * 8) - 80 - 35 = 336 - 115 = 221.
(42 * 8) - (80 + 35) = 336 - 115 = 221.

(35 * 8) = 280. Left: 42, 80.
(35 * 8) - 80 - 42 = 280 - 122 = 158.

2692,434,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers [38, 65, 24, 75] to reach the target number 78. Each number must be used exactly once, and only the operations +, -, *, / are allowed.

Let's list the numbers: 38, 65, 24, 75.
Target: 78.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to get 78. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to the target.

Initial thoughts:
- The target (78) is relatively close to some of the numbers (e.g., 75).
- I have a large number (75) and a medium number (65), and two smaller numbers (38, 24).
- Multiplication might increase the numbers too quickly, so I should be careful with that.
- Division might be useful to reduce numbers or create fractions, but I need to ensure the result is an integer if intermediate steps are not explicitly allowed to be non-integers. The prompt doesn't specify, but usually, these puzzles imply integer intermediate results or a final integer result. Let's assume integer intermediate results are preferred if possible.

Let's try combining the largest numbers first.
75 and 65.
75 + 65 = 140 (too big)
75 - 65 = 10 (too small)
75 * 65 (way too big)
75 / 65 (not an integer)

Let's try combining 75 with one of the smaller numbers.
75 + 24 = 99 (close, need to reduce by 21 using 38 and 65)
  Can I get 21 from 38 and 65?
  65 - 38 = 27 (no)
  38 - 65 (negative)
  65 / 38 (not integer)
  38 / 65 (not integer)
  65 + 38 = 103 (no)
  65 * 38 (too big)
  38 * 65 (too big)
So, (75 + 24) - (65 - 38) = 99 - 27 = 72 (close, but not 78)
So, (75 + 24) - (65 + 38) = 99 - 103 = -4 (no)
So, (75 + 24) + (65 - 38) = 99 + 27 = 126 (no)

Let's try 75 - 24 = 51. Need to add 27 using 38 and 65.
  Can I get 27 from 38 and 65?
  65 - 38 = 27. Yes!
  So, (75 - 24) + (65 - 38) = 51 + 27 = 78.
  Let's check the numbers used: 75, 24, 65, 38. All used exactly once.
  Operations: -, +, -. Valid.
  Result: 78. Correct.

Let's verify this equation: (75 - 24) + (65 - 38)
Step 1: 75 - 24 = 51
Step 2: 65 - 38 = 27
Step 3: 51 + 27 = 78

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough.
What if I use 38 and 24 first?
38 + 24 = 62. Need to get 16 from 75 and 65.
  75 - 65 = 10 (no)
  65 - 75 (negative)
  75 + 65 = 140 (no)
  75 / 65 (not integer)
  65 / 75 (not integer)

38 - 24 = 14. Need to get 64 from 75 and 65.
  75 - 65 = 10 (no)
  75 + 65 = 140 (no)

38 * 24 (too big)
38 / 24 (not integer)

What if I use 65 and 24?
65 + 24 = 89. Need to reduce by 11 using 38 and 75.
  75 - 38 = 37 (no)
  38 - 75 (negative)
  75 + 38 = 113 (no)

65 - 24 = 41. Need to add 37 using 38 and 75.
  75 - 38 = 37. Yes!
  So, (65 - 24) + (75 - 38) = 41 + 37 = 78.
  Numbers used: 65, 24, 75, 38. All used exactly once.
  Operations: -, +, -. Valid.
  Result: 78. Correct.

This is another valid solution: (65 - 24) + (75 - 38).
Let's check:
Step 1: 65 - 24 = 41
Step 2: 75 - 38 = 37
Step 3: 41 + 37 = 78

Both (75 - 24) + (65 - 38) and (65 - 24) + (75 - 38) are valid. The order of the first two terms doesn't matter due to commutativity of addition.

Let's try multiplication.
Could 38 * 2 = 76 be a starting point? No, I don't have 2.
Could 24 * 3 = 72? No, I don't have 3.

What about division?
Maybe something like (75 + X) / Y = 78?
Or X / (Y - Z) = 78?

Let's try to get a number close to 78 using multiplication and then adjust.
If I multiply 38 by something, it gets big fast.
38 * 1 = 38
38 * 2 = 76 (close)
Can I make 2 from 65, 24, 75?
  (75 - 65) / ? = 10 / ?
  (65 - 24) / ? = 41 / ?
  (75 - 24) / ? = 51 / ?
  (75 + 65) / ? = 140 / ?
  (65 + 24) / ? = 89 / ?
  (75 + 24) / ? = 99 / ?
  (75 - 65) = 10. Can I get 5 from 24 and 38? No.
  (65 - 24) = 41.
  (75 - 24) = 51.
  (75 + 65) = 140.
  (65 + 24) = 89.
  (75 + 24) = 99.

Let's try to get 78 by multiplying two numbers.
None of the numbers are factors of 78 (78 = 2 * 3 * 13).
So, direct multiplication of two numbers from the set won't work.

Let's go back to the additive/subtractive combinations.
We found (75 - 24) + (65 - 38) = 78.
And (65 - 24) + (75 - 38) = 78.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe (A * B) + C - D = 78?
Or (A + B) * C - D = 78?

Consider 24 * 3 = 72. We don't have 3.
Consider 38 * 2 = 76. We don't have 2.

What if we use division to create a smaller number to multiply?
Example: (65 / ?) * ?
(65 / 24) - not integer.
(65 / 38) - not integer.
(65 / 75) - not integer.

(75 / 24) - not integer.

If Z = 6, then X - Y = 96. Can we make 96 from 41 and 55? 41 + 55 = 96. So (41 + 55) / 6 = 16. This is the same solution.

If Z = 41, then X - Y = 16 * 41 = 656. Can we make 656 from 6 and 55? No.
If Z = 55, then X - Y = 16 * 55 = 880. Can we make 880 from 6 and 41? No.

Possibility 1: Start with multiplication.
- 41 * 34 = 1394 (Too large)
- 41 * 15 = 615 (Too large)
- 34 * 15 = 510 (Too large)

Possibility 2: Start with addition/subtraction.
- 41 + 34 = 75. Then use 15. 75 - 15 = 60. This looks promising.
Let's check: (41 + 34) - 15 = 75 - 15 = 60.
This uses 41, 34, and 15 exactly once.
The operators are + and -.
The result is 60.

Let's explore other combinations just to be sure.

Possibility 3: Mix operations.
- (41 - 34) * 15 = 7 * 15 = 105 (Not 60)
- (41 + 15) - 34 = 56 - 34 = 22 (Not 60)
- (41 - 15) + 34 = 26 + 34 = 60. This also works!
Let's check: (41 - 15) + 34 = 26 + 34 = 60.
This uses 41, 15, and 34 exactly once.
The operators are - and +.
The result is 60.

Both (41 + 34) - 15 and (41 - 15) + 34 work. I will choose the first one as it was found first.

I need to explore different combinations of operations and number placements.

Let's list the numbers: 41, 76, 56.
Target: 61.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 61
2. a op (b op c) = 61

Let's try combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first, as it often leads to larger numbers that might need subtraction.
- (76 * 41) - 56 = 3116 - 56 = 3060 (Too large)
- (76 * 56) - 41 = 4256 - 41 = 4215 (Too large)
- (41 * 56) - 76 = 2296 - 76 = 2220 (Too large)

Attempt 2: Using division. Division can reduce numbers significantly.
- (76 / 41) ... not an integer, unlikely to work cleanly.
- (76 / 56) ... not an integer.
- (56 / 41) ... not an integer.
- (41 / 76) ... not an integer.
- (41 / 56) ... not an integer.
- (56 / 76) ... not an integer.

This suggests that direct division of the given numbers might not be the primary step unless it's part of a larger expression that results in an integer.

Let's try combinations involving addition and subtraction first, then maybe multiplication or division.

Attempt 3: Addition and subtraction.
- 76 + 56 - 41 = 132 - 41 = 91 (Close, but not 61)
- 76 + 41 - 56 = 117 - 56 = 61 (Found it!)

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 76, 41, 56 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic).
Result: 61.

The equation is 76 + 41 - 56.

Let's check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one seems correct and straightforward.

Consider order of operations:
76 + 41 - 56 = (76 + 41) - 56 = 117 - 56 = 61. This is valid.

What about other arrangements?
- 41 + 76 - 56 = 117 - 56 = 61 (Same equation, just order of first two numbers swapped)
- 56 + 76 - 41 = 132 - 41 = 91 (Already checked)
- 76 - 56 + 41 = 20 + 41 = 61 (This is also a valid solution!)
- 41 - 56 + 76 = -15 + 76 = 61 (This is also a valid solution!)
- 56 - 41 + 76 = 15 + 76 = 91 (Already checked)

The user asked for *an* equation. I have found multiple valid ones. I will present one of them.
76 + 41 - 56 = 61 is a clear and direct solution.
76 - 56 + 41 = 61 is also valid.
41 - 56 + 76 = 61 is also valid.

The problem requires me to use the numbers 6, 52, and 29 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to arrive at the target value of 17. I need to explore various combinations and permutations.

Let's list the numbers: {6, 52, 29}.
Target: 17.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

I need to arrange these three numbers and two operations in a way that results in 17. The order of operations matters, so I should consider parentheses as well, although the problem statement only explicitly mentions basic arithmetic operations. However, to achieve a specific target with a limited set of numbers and operations, parentheses are often implicitly allowed to dictate the order of evaluation. Let's assume standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and explore combinations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try combinations with the numbers {6, 52, 29}.

Trial 1: Start with 52.
- (52 / 6) ... 52 is not divisible by 6 without remainder. This might lead to fractions, which could be problematic if the final result needs to be an integer without explicit fraction handling. Let's try to avoid intermediate fractions if possible, or see if they resolve. 52/6 = 26/3.
  - (52 / 6) + 29 = 26/3 + 29 = 26/3 + 87/3 = 113/3. Not 17.
  - (52 / 6) - 29 = 26/3 - 29 = 26/3 - 87/3 = -61/3. Not 17.
  - 29 - (52 / 6) = 29 - 26/3 = 87/3 - 26/3 = 61/3. Not 17.
  - (52 / 6) * 29 = (26/3) * 29 = 754/3. Not 17.
  - 29 * (52 / 6) = 754/3. Not 17.

- (52 * 6) ... 52 * 6 = 312.
  - (52 * 6) + 29 = 312 + 29 = 341. Not 17.
  - (52 * 6) - 29 = 312 - 29 = 283. Not 17.
  - 29 - (52 * 6) = 29 - 312 = -283. Not 17.
  - (52 * 6) / 29 = 312 / 29. 312 = 290 + 22. Not divisible. 312/29 is not an integer.
  - 29 / (52 * 6) = 29 / 312. Not 17.

- (52 + 6) ... 52 + 6 = 58.
  - (52 + 6) + 29 = 58 + 29 = 87. Not 17.
  - (52 + 6) - 29 = 58 - 29 = 29. Not 17.
  - 29 - (52 + 6) = 29 - 58 = -29. Not 17.
  - (52 + 6) / 29 = 58 / 29 = 2. Not 17.
  - 29 / (52 + 6) = 29 / 58 = 1/2. Not 17.

- (52 - 6) ... 52 - 6 = 46.
  - (52 - 6) + 29 = 46 + 29 = 75. Not 17.
  - (52 - 6) - 29 = 46 - 29 = 17. Found it! Let's check the numbers and operations.
    - Numbers used: 52, 6, 29. All used exactly once.
    - Operations used: -, +. Basic arithmetic.
    - Equation: (52 - 6) + 29.
    - Evaluation: (46) + 29 = 75. This is not 17. My calculation was wrong. 46 - 29 = 17. So it should be (52 - 6) - 29.

Let's re-evaluate (52 - 6) - 29:
- Numbers: 52, 6, 29. Used once.
- Operations: -, -. Basic arithmetic.
- Evaluation: (52 - 6) - 29 = 46 - 29 = 17.
This works! The equation is (52 - 6) - 29.

Let's try other combinations to be thorough and ensure this is the most straightforward or if there are others.

Trial 2: Start with 29.
- (29 / 6) ... not integer.
- (29 * 6) ... 29 * 6 = 174.
  - (29 * 6) + 52 = 174 + 52 = 226.
  - (29 * 6) - 52 = 174 - 52 = 122.
  - 52 - (29 * 6) = 52 - 174 = -122.
  - (29 * 6) / 52 = 174 / 52. Not integer.
  - 52 / (29 * 6) = 52 / 174. Not 17.

- (29 + 6) ... 29 + 6 = 35.
  - (29 + 6) + 52 = 35 + 52 = 87.
  - (29 + 6) - 52 = 35 - 52 = -17. Close, but negative.
  - 52 - (29 + 6) = 52 - 35 = 17. Found another one!
    - Numbers: 52, 29, 6. Used once.
    - Operations: -, +. Basic arithmetic.
    - Equation: 52 - (29 + 6).
    - Evaluation: 52 - (35) = 17.
    This also works.

- (29 - 6) ... 29 - 6 = 23.
  - (29 - 6) + 52 = 23 + 52 = 75.
  - (29 - 6) - 52 = 23 - 52 = -29.
  - 52 - (29 - 6) = 52 - 23 = 29.

Trial 3: Start with 6.
- (6 / 52) ... not integer.
- (6 * 52) ... 6 * 52 = 312. (Already explored in Trial 1, starting with 52*6)
- (6 + 52) ... 6 + 52 = 58. (Already explored in Trial 1, starting with 52+6)
- (6 - 52) ... 6 - 52 = -46.
  - (6 - 52) + 29 = -46 + 29 = -17. Close, but negative.
  - (6 - 52) - 29 = -46 - 29 = -75.
  - 29 - (6 - 52) = 29 - (-46) = 29 + 46 = 75.

Let's consider the structure a op1 (b op2 c).
We found (52 - 6) - 29, which is (a - b) - c.
We found 52 - (29 + 6), which is a - (b + c).

Let's check other permutations for a - (b + c) or a - (b - c) etc.
- 29 - (52 + 6) = 29 - 58 = -29.

The problem requires me to find a mathematical expression that evaluates to 39 using the numbers 88, 58, and 69 exactly once each. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let the numbers be $a = 88$, $b = 58$, and $c = 69$. I need to combine these using +, -, *, / to get 39.

I will explore different combinations and orderings.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try combinations with the numbers in the given order (88, 58, 69).

Attempt 1: (88 + 58) + 69 = 146 + 69 = 215 (Too high)
Attempt 2: (88 + 58) - 69 = 146 - 69 = 77 (Too high)
Attempt 3: (88 + 58) * 69 = 146 * 69 (Very high)

Let's try changing the order of numbers.

Try order (58, 88, 69):
Attempt 15: (58 + 88) + 69 = 146 + 69 = 215
Attempt 16: (58 + 88) - 69 = 146 - 69 = 77
Attempt 17: (58 - 88) + 69 = -30 + 69 = 39. This works!
The expression is (58 - 88) + 69.
Let's verify: 58 - 88 = -30. -30 + 69 = 39.
This uses 58, 88, and 69 exactly once. It uses subtraction and addition.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

Attempt 28: (58 + 69) - 88 = 127 - 88 = 39. This also works!
The expression is (58 + 69) - 88.
Let's verify: 58 + 69 = 127. 127 - 88 = 39.
This uses 58, 69, and 88 exactly once. It uses addition and subtraction.

2. (69 - 88) + 58
3. (58 + 69) - 88
4. (69 + 58) - 88

All of these are valid. I will pick one. (58 + 69) - 88 seems straightforward.

Let's consider if division could be involved.
If division results in an integer, it might be useful.
88 / 58 (no)
88 / 69 (no)
58 / 88 (no)
58 / 69 (no)
69 / 88 (no)
69 / 58 (no)

What if the division is part of a larger expression that results in an integer?
For example, (X * Y) / Z.
Let's try to get a number that, when operated on with the third number, gives 39.

Target = 39. Numbers = {88, 58, 69}.

Possibility: X op Y = K, then K op Z = 39.

Case 1: K + Z = 39
If Z = 88, K = 39 - 88 = -49. Can we get -49 from 58 and 69?
58 + 69 = 127
58 - 69 = -11
69 - 58 = 11
58 * 69 (large)
58 / 69 (no)
69 / 58 (no)
No.

If Z = 58, K = 39 - 58 = -19. Can we get -19 from 88 and 69?
88 + 69 = 157
88 - 69 = 19
69 - 88 = -19. Yes!
So, (69 - 88) + 58 = -19 + 58 = 39. This is one of the solutions found earlier.

If Z = 69, K = 39 - 69 = -30. Can we get -30 from 88 and 58?
88 + 58 = 146
88 - 58 = 30
58 - 88 = -30. Yes!
So, (58 - 88) + 69 = -30 + 69 = 39. This is another solution found earlier.

Let's list the numbers: {5, 2, 64}
Target: 57

We need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. Since there are three numbers, we will have two operations. The order of operations matters, so we should consider different groupings and orders.

Possible combinations of two operations:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try some combinations systematically.

Numbers: 5, 2, 64

Possibility 1: Using 64 as a starting point, as it's the largest number.
- 64 - ? = 57. This means ? = 7. Can we make 7 from 5 and 2? Yes, 5 + 2 = 7.
So, 64 - (5 + 2) = 64 - 7 = 57.

  - 32 / 5 = 6.4 (not 57)
  - 5 / 32 = 0.15625 (not 57)

- If we divide 64 by 5, we get 12.8. Can we get 57 from 12.8 and 2?
  - 12.8 + 2 = 14.8 (not 57)
  - 12.8 - 2 = 10.8 (not 57)
  - 2 - 12.8 = -10.8 (not 57)
  - 12.8 * 2 = 25.6 (not 57)
  - 12.8 / 2 = 6.4 (not 57)
  - 2 / 12.8 = 0.15625 (not 57)

- If we divide 5 by 2, we get 2.5. Can we get 57 from 2.5 and 64?
  - 64 - 2.5 = 61.5 (not 57)
  - 64 + 2.5 = 66.5 (not 57)
  - 2.5 - 64 = -61.5 (not 57)
  - 64 * 2.5 = 160 (not 57)
  - 64 / 2.5 = 25.6 (not 57)
  - 2.5 / 64 = 0.0390625 (not 57)

Possibility 4: Addition.
- 5 + 2 = 7. We already checked this with 64. 64 - 7 = 57. This is our first solution.
- 5 + 64 = 69. Can we get 57 from 69 and 2?
  - 69 - 2 = 67 (not 57)
  - 69 + 2 = 71 (not 57)
  - 2 - 69 = -67 (not 57)
  - 69 * 2 = 138 (not 57)
  - 69 / 2 = 34.5 (not 57)
  - 2 / 69 = 0.0289... (not 57)

1289,1588,"<think>The problem asks me to use the numbers 93, 88, 1, and 69 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to arrive at the target number 73.

I need to explore different combinations and orders of operations.

Let's list the numbers: 93, 88, 1, 69.
Target: 73.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Combine smaller numbers first.
3. Look for combinations that get close to the target.

Let's try combining 93 and 88.
93 + 88 = 181 (too large)
93 - 88 = 5
88 - 93 = -5
93 * 88 = large
93 / 88 = ~1.05

Let's try combining 93 and 69.
93 + 69 = 162
93 - 69 = 24
69 - 93 = -24
93 * 69 = large
93 / 69 = ~1.35

Let's try combining 88 and 69.
88 + 69 = 157
88 - 69 = 19
69 - 88 = -19
88 * 69 = large
88 / 69 = ~1.27

The differences (5, 24, 19) seem more promising as they are smaller.

Case 1: Start with 93 - 88 = 5.
Remaining numbers: 1, 69.
Target from 5: 73. Need to get +68 from 1 and 69.
5 + 1 + 69 = 75 (close)
5 + 69 + 1 = 75
5 + (69 * 1) = 74 (close)
5 + (69 / 1) = 74 (close)
5 + (1 * 69) = 74
5 + (1 / 69) = not integer
5 + (69 - 1) = 73. This works!
So, (93 - 88) + (69 - 1) = 5 + 68 = 73.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 93, 88, 69, 1. Yes.
Let's check if only basic operations are used: -, +, -. Yes.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there are simpler ones.

Case 2: Start with 88 - 69 = 19.
Remaining numbers: 93, 1.
Target from 19: 73. Need to get +54 from 93 and 1.
19 + 93 + 1 = 113
19 + 93 - 1 = 111
19 + (93 * 1) = 112
19 + (93 / 1) = 112
19 + (1 * 93) = 112
19 + (1 / 93) = not integer
19 + (93 - 1) = 19 + 92 = 111
19 - (93 - 1) = 19 - 92 = -73 (close, but wrong sign)
19 - (93 + 1) = 19 - 94 = -75
19 - (93 * 1) = 19 - 93 = -74
19 - (93 / 1) = 19 - 93 = -74

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe (93 - 1) * something?
93 - 1 = 92. Remaining: 88, 69.
92 * 88 = large
92 * 69 = large
92 / 88 = ~1.04
92 / 69 = ~1.33

Maybe (88 - 1) * something?
88 - 1 = 87. Remaining: 93, 69.
87 * 93 = large
87 * 69 = large
87 / 93 = ~0.93
87 / 69 = ~1.26

Maybe (69 - 1) * something?
69 - 1 = 68. Remaining: 93, 88.
68 * 93 = large
68 * 88 = large
68 / 93 = ~0.73
68 / 88 = ~0.77

Let's try division first.
93 / 1 = 93. Remaining: 88, 69.
93 + 88 + 69 = large
93 - 88 + 69 = 5 + 69 = 74 (close)
93 + 88 - 69 = 181 - 69 = 112
93 - 69 + 88 = 24 + 88 = 112
93 + 69 - 88 = 162 - 88 = 74 (close)
93 - (88 - 69) = 93 - 19 = 74 (close)
93 - (69 - 88) = 93 - (-19) = 112
93 - (88 + 69) = 93 - 157 = -64

Let's re-examine 93 + 69 - 88 = 74. We need 73.
This used 93, 69, 88. Remaining is 1.
So, (93 + 69 - 88) - 1 = 74 - 1 = 73.
This also works! (93 + 69 - 88) - 1 = 73.
Numbers used: 93, 69, 88, 1. Operations: +, -, -.

Let's re-examine 93 - 88 + 69 = 74. We need 73.
This used 93, 88, 69. Remaining is 1.

Let's go back to the first one I found: (93 - 88) + (69 - 1) = 73.
This seems straightforward and uses parentheses clearly.

Let's try another combination.
Maybe use 1 to modify one of the numbers before other operations.
(93 - 1) = 92. Remaining: 88, 69. Target from 92: 73. Need -19.
92 - (88 - 69) = 92 - 19 = 73.
This works! (93 - 1) - (88 - 69) = 73.
Numbers used: 93, 1, 88, 69. Operations: -, -, -.

(88 - 1) = 87. Remaining: 93, 69. Target from 87: 73. Need -14.
87 - (93 - 69) = 87 - 24 = 63 (not 73)
87 - (69 - 93) = 87 - (-24) = 111

(69 - 1) = 68. Remaining: 93, 88. Target from 68: 73. Need +5.
68 + (93 - 88) = 68 + 5 = 73.
This works! (69 - 1) + (93 - 88) = 73.
Numbers used: 69, 1, 93, 88. Operations: -, +, -. This is the same as the first one, just reordered.

3852,525,"<think>The problem requires me to find a mathematical equation using the numbers [72, 66, 42, 6] exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /, to achieve a result of 30.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 72, 66, 42, 6
Target: 30
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /

I need to combine these four numbers using three operations to get 30. I will try different combinations and see if I can reach the target.

Strategy:
1.  **Look for large numbers and see how they can be reduced or combined to get closer to 30.**
    *   72 is significantly larger than 30.
    *   66 is also larger than 30.
    *   42 is closer to 30.
    *   6 is the smallest.

2.  **Consider division first, as it can significantly reduce large numbers.**
    *   Can 72 be divided by any of the other numbers?
        *   72 / 6 = 12. This is a good start. The remaining numbers are 66 and 42. Can I combine 12, 66, and 42 to get 30?

            *   12 / 66 ... not an integer.
            *   66 / 12 ... not an integer.
            *   42 / 12 ... not an integer.

    *   Can 42 be divided by any of the other numbers?
        *   42 / 6 = 7. Remaining numbers are 72 and 66. Can I combine 7, 72, and 66 to get 30?
            *   7 + 72 - 66 = 79 - 66 = 13. Not 30.
            *   7 - 72 + 66 = -65 + 66 = 1. Not 30.

        *   42 / 66 ... not integer.

3.  **Consider multiplication.**
    *   What if I multiply two numbers?
        *   6 * 7 = 42. (Used 6, need to get 7 from 72, 66, 42. Not possible directly).
        *   6 * 42 = 252. Too large.
        *   6 * 66 = 396. Too large.
        *   6 * 72 = 432. Too large.

    *   (72 / 6) = 12. Remaining: 66, 42. Target from these two and 12 is 30.
        *   12 + (66 - 42) = 12 + 24 = 36. (Used 72, 6, 66, 42. Result 36).

        *   7 + (72 - 66) = 7 + 6 = 13. (Used 42, 6, 72, 66. Result 13).
        *   7 - (72 - 66) = 7 - 6 = 1.
        *   (72 - 66) - 7 = 6 - 7 = -1.
        *   7 + (66 - 72) = 7 - 6 = 1.

5.  **Let's try a different structure. Maybe subtraction of a product or division.**
    *   Target is 30.
    *   Consider 72. How can I get 30 from 72 and the others?
        *   72 - X = 30 => X = 42. Can I get 42 from 66, 42, 6? No, 42 is one of the numbers.
        *   X - 72 = 30 => X = 102. Can I get 102 from 66, 42, 6? 66 + 42 - 6 = 108 - 6 = 102.
            So, (66 + 42 - 6) - 72 = 102 - 72 = 30.
            Let's check the numbers used: 66, 42, 6, 72. All used once.
            Let's check the operations: +, -, -. Allowed.
            Let's check the result: 30. Correct.
            This looks like a valid solution.

    *   Let's try another path to confirm.
    *   Consider 66.
        *   66 - X = 30 => X = 36. Can I get 36 from 72, 42, 6?
            *   72 - 42 + 6 = 30 + 6 = 36.
            So, 66 - (72 - 42 + 6) = 66 - (30 + 6) = 66 - 36 = 30.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 49, 45, and 94 to reach the target number 98.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  (49 + 45) + 94 = 94 + 94 = 188 (Too high)
2.  (49 - 45) + 94 = 4 + 94 = 98 (This works!)
3.  (49 * 45) + 94 = 2205 + 94 = 2299 (Too high)
4.  (49 / 45) + 94 = (approx 1.08) + 94 = 95.08 (Not 98)
5.  49 + (45 + 94) = 49 + 139 = 188 (Too high)
6.  49 - (45 + 94) = 49 - 139 = -90 (Too low)
7.  49 * (45 + 94) = 49 * 139 = 6811 (Too high)
8.  49 / (45 + 94) = 49 / 139 = (approx 0.35) (Too low)
9.  49 + (94 - 45) = 49 + 49 = 98 (This also works!)
10. 49 - (94 - 45) = 49 - 49 = 0 (Too low)
11. 49 * (94 - 45) = 49 * 49 = 2401 (Too high)
12. 49 / (94 - 45) = 49 / 49 = 1 (Too low)
13. (94 + 45) - 49 = 139 - 49 = 90 (Too low)
14. (94 - 45) + 49 = 49 + 49 = 98 (This also works!)
15. (94 * 45) - 49 = 4230 - 49 = 4181 (Too high)
16. (94 / 45) - 49 = (approx 2.08) - 49 = -46.92 (Too low)
17. 94 + (49 - 45) = 94 + 4 = 98 (This also works!)
18. 94 - (49 - 45) = 94 - 4 = 90 (Too low)
19. 94 * (49 - 45) = 94 * 4 = 376 (Too high)
20. 94 / (49 - 45) = 94 / 4 = 23.5 (Too low)
21. 45 + (94 - 49) = 45 + 45 = 90 (Too low)
22. 45 - (94 - 49) = 45 - 45 = 0 (Too low)
23. 45 * (94 - 49) = 45 * 45 = 2025 (Too high)
24. 45 / (94 - 49) = 45 / 45 = 1 (Too low)

Several options work. I'll pick one of the simpler ones.
(49 - 45) + 94 = 4 + 94 = 98
49 + (94 - 45) = 49 + 49 = 98
94 + (49 - 45) = 94 + 4 = 98
(94 - 45) + 49 = 49 + 49 = 98

I'll use 94 + (49 - 45).

Let's explore possible combinations:

1.  **Start with multiplication/division:**
    *   40 * 45 = 1800. 1800 / 60 = 30. This works! It uses all numbers and results in 30.
    *   40 * 60 = 2400. 2400 / 45 is not an integer.

3392,1525,"<think>The problem requires me to find a single mathematical equation using the numbers 63, 84, and 6, and the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 15. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [63, 84, 6]
Target value: 15

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 15
2. a op (b op c) = 15

Let's try different pairings and operations.

Attempt 1: Start with 63 and 84.
- 63 + 84 = 147. Then 147 op 6 = 15. 147 - 132 = 15. No easy way to get 132 from 6. 147 / x = 15. x = 147/15 = 9.8. Not useful.
- 63 - 84 = -21. Then -21 op 6 = 15. -21 + 36 = 15. No easy way to get 36 from 6. -21 / x = 15. x = -21/15 = -1.4. Not useful.
- 84 - 63 = 21. Then 21 op 6 = 15. 21 - 6 = 15. This works!
The equation is (84 - 63) - 6 = 15.
Let's verify:
84 - 63 = 21
21 - 6 = 15
This uses 84, 63, and 6 exactly once. It uses subtraction twice. The operations are +, -, *, /. This fits the criteria.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

Attempt 2: Start with 63 and 6.
- 63 + 6 = 69. Then 69 op 84 = 15. 69 - 54 = 15. No easy way to get 54 from 84. 69 / x = 15. x = 69/15 = 4.6.
- 63 - 6 = 57. Then 57 op 84 = 15. 57 - 42 = 15. No easy way to get 42 from 84. 57 / x = 15. x = 57/15 = 3.8.
- 63 * 6 = 378. Then 378 op 84 = 15. 378 / x = 15. x = 378/15 = 25.2. 378 - x = 15. x = 363.
- 63 / 6 = 10.5. Then 10.5 op 84 = 15. 10.5 + 4.5 = 15. No easy way to get 4.5 from 84. 84 - 10.5 = 73.5. 84 / 10.5 = 8.

Attempt 3: Start with 84 and 6.
- 84 + 6 = 90. Then 90 op 63 = 15. 90 - 75 = 15. No easy way to get 75 from 63. 90 / x = 15. x = 90/15 = 6. This would mean 90 / 6 = 15, but we need to use 63. So (84+6)/63 is not 15.
- 84 - 6 = 78. Then 78 op 63 = 15. 78 - 63 = 15. This works!
The equation is (84 - 6) - 63 = 15.
Let's verify:
84 - 6 = 78
78 - 63 = 15
This uses 84, 6, and 63 exactly once. It uses subtraction twice. This also fits the criteria.

- 84 * 6 = 504. Then 504 op 63 = 15. 504 / x = 15. x = 504/15 = 33.6. 504 - x = 15. x = 489.
- 84 / 6 = 14. Then 14 op 63 = 15. 14 + 1 = 15. No easy way to get 1 from 63. 63 - 14 = 49. 63 / 14 = 4.5.

So far, I have found two valid solutions:
1. (84 - 63) - 6 = 15
2. (84 - 6) - 63 = 15

The problem asks for ""a single mathematical equation"". I can present either one. The first one I found was (84 - 63) - 6 = 15.

Let's consider if there are any other structures.
What about division involving 63 or 84?
- 63 / (something with 84 and 6) = 15.
- 84 / (something with 63 and 6) = 15.
  - 84 / (63 - 6) = 84 / 57 (not 15)
  - 84 / (63 + 6) = 84 / 69 (not 15)
  - 84 / (6 * 63) = 84 / 378 (not 15)
  - 84 / (63 / 6) = 84 / 10.5 = 8 (not 15)
  - 84 / (6 / 63) = 84 * (63/6) = 84 * 10.5 = 882 (not 15)

What about multiplication?
- 63 * (something with 84 and 6) = 15. This would require a fraction, e.g., 63 * (15/63).
- 84 * (something with 63 and 6) = 15.
- 6 * (something with 63 and 84) = 15.
  - 6 * (84 / 63) = 6 * (4/3) = 8 (not 15)
  - 6 * (63 / 84) = 6 * (3/4) = 4.5 (not 15)
  - 6 * (84 - 63) = 6 * 21 = 126 (not 15)
  - 6 * (63 - 84) = 6 * (-21) = -126 (not 15)
  - 6 * (84 + 63) = 6 * 147 = 882 (not 15)

Let's re-examine the division 84 / 6 = 14.
We need to get 15 using 14 and 63.
14 + 1 = 15. Can we get 1 from 63? No, not directly.
What if we use 63 in a way that results in 1?
For example, if we had 63 / 63 = 1. But we only have one 63.

Let's go back to the successful ones.
(84 - 63) - 6 = 15
(84 - 6) - 63 = 15

Are there any other combinations of operations?
Consider division as the last step.
(a op b) / c = 15
(63 + 84) / 6 = 147 / 6 = 24.5
(63 - 84) / 6 = -21 / 6 = -3.5
(84 - 63) / 6 = 21 / 6 = 3.5
(63 * 84) / 6 = 5292 / 6 = 882
(63 / 84) / 6 = (3/4) / 6 = 3/24 = 1/8

The user wants an equation using the numbers 39, 66, 3, and 58, exactly once each, to reach the target result of 28. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: [39, 66, 3, 58]
Target: 28

I need to combine these four numbers using the allowed operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to 28.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with larger numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Combine smaller numbers first.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers close to 28 or factors of numbers that could lead to 28.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(66 - 39) = 27. Close to 28.
Now I have 27, 3, and 58.
Can I get 1 from 3 and 58? No easy way.
Can I get 28 from 27, 3, 58?
27 + 3 = 30. Then 30 - 58 is negative. 30 + 58 is too big.
27 * 3 = 81. Too big.
27 / 3 = 9. Then 9 and 58. 58 - 9 = 49. 58 + 9 = 67.

Attempt 2:
(58 - 39) = 19.
Now I have 19, 66, 3.
19 + 66 = 85. 85 - 3 = 82.
19 * 3 = 57. 66 - 57 = 9.
66 / 3 = 22. 22 + 19 = 41. 22 - 19 = 3.

Attempt 3:
(66 / 3) = 22.
Now I have 22, 39, 58.
22 + 39 = 61. 61 - 58 = 3.
22 + 58 = 80. 80 - 39 = 41.
58 - 39 = 19. 22 + 19 = 41.
39 - 22 = 17. 58 - 17 = 41.
58 / 22 is not an integer.
39 / 22 is not an integer.

Attempt 4:
(39 / 3) = 13.
Now I have 13, 66, 58.
13 + 66 = 79. 79 - 58 = 21.
13 + 58 = 71. 71 - 66 = 5.
66 - 58 = 8. 13 + 8 = 21.
66 - 13 = 53. 58 - 53 = 5.
58 - 13 = 45. 66 - 45 = 21.

Attempt 5:
Let's try multiplication first.
3 * 39 = 117. Too big.
3 * 66 = 198. Too big.
3 * 58 = 174. Too big.

Let's try combining two numbers to get something that, when combined with the other two, gets 28.

Consider the target 28.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 28 or (A + B) * C - D = 28.

Let's try to get a number close to 28 by combining two numbers.
66 - 39 = 27. We saw this.
58 - 3 = 55.
58 - 39 = 19.
66 - 3 = 63.
39 - 3 = 36.

Let's try to make a number that, when added/subtracted from another, gives 28.
For example, if I can make 50, then 50 - 22 = 28. Can I make 50 from two numbers and 22 from the other two?
Numbers: [39, 66, 3, 58]

Let's try to get 28 directly.
What if we multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the others?
(3 * 58) = 174. Too big.
(3 * 39) = 117. Too big.
(3 * 66) = 198. Too big.

What if we divide two numbers?
66 / 3 = 22. Remaining: [39, 58]. 22 + 39 - 58 = 61 - 58 = 3. No. 22 + 58 - 39 = 80 - 39 = 41. No.
39 / 3 = 13. Remaining: [66, 58]. 13 + 66 - 58 = 79 - 58 = 21. No. 13 + 58 - 66 = 71 - 66 = 5. No.

Let's try combining three numbers first.
(66 - 39) * 3 = 27 * 3 = 81. Then 81 - 58 = 23. Close.
(66 - 39) + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30. Then 30 - 58 = -28. Close, but wrong sign.
(66 - 39) - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24. Then 24 + 58 = 82.

Let's try subtraction from a larger number.
58 - (something) = 28. So, something = 30.
Can I make 30 from [39, 66, 3]?
66 - 39 + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30. Yes!
So, the equation could be 58 - (66 - 39 + 3) = 28.
Let's check: 58 - (27 + 3) = 58 - 30 = 28.
This uses all numbers [39, 66, 3, 58] exactly once.
Operations used: subtraction, addition.

Let's verify the order of operations.
58 - (66 - 39 + 3)
Inside the parenthesis:
66 - 39 = 27
27 + 3 = 30
Then:
58 - 30 = 28.

This looks correct.

Let's try another possibility just to be sure.
What if we aim for a number that, when multiplied, gives 28?
Factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

Can we make 4 and 7?
Numbers: [39, 66, 3, 58]
Can we make 4 from two numbers and 7 from the other two?
Let's try to make 4:
39 - 3 = 36.
66 - 58 = 8.
58 - 39 = 19.
66 / 3 = 22.
39 / 3 = 13.

Let's try to make 7:
39 - 3 = 36.
66 - 58 = 8.
58 - 39 = 19.

Let's try to make 14 and 2.
Can we make 14 from two numbers and 2 from the other two?
Make 2:
3 - ? No.
66 / 3 = 22.
39 / 3 = 13.

Let's go back to the successful attempt: 58 - (66 - 39 + 3) = 28.
This is a valid solution.

Let's consider if there are other ways to group it.
(58 - 66 + 39 - 3) = -8 + 39 - 3 = 31 - 3 = 28.
This also works and uses all numbers and allowed operations.
58 - 66 + 39 - 3 = 28.

I must use the numbers 21, 85, and 17 exactly once.
I can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
I need to show my thought process, including trials and errors.

Let's list the numbers: 21, 85, 17.
Target value: 16.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations.
The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) will be important.

Let's try some combinations.

**Attempt 1: Simple additions/subtractions**
*   21 + 85 + 17 = 123 (Too large)
*   21 + 85 - 17 = 89 (Too large)
*   21 - 85 + 17 = -47 (Incorrect sign and magnitude)
*   21 - 85 - 17 = -81 (Incorrect sign and magnitude)
*   85 + 17 - 21 = 81 (Too large)
*   85 - 17 + 21 = 89 (Too large)
*   85 - 17 - 21 = 47 (Too large)
*   17 + 21 - 85 = -47 (Incorrect sign and magnitude)
*   17 - 21 + 85 = 81 (Too large)
*   17 - 21 - 85 = -89 (Incorrect sign and magnitude)

These simple combinations don't seem to get close to 16. This suggests multiplication or division might be necessary to reduce the magnitude or create a specific relationship.

**Attempt 2: Introducing multiplication**
Let's try multiplying two numbers and then combining with the third.

*   (21 * 85) + 17 = 1785 + 17 = 1802 (Way too large)
*   (21 * 85) - 17 = 1785 - 17 = 1768 (Way too large)
*   (21 * 17) + 85 = 357 + 85 = 442 (Too large)
*   (21 * 17) - 85 = 357 - 85 = 272 (Too large)
*   (85 * 17) + 21 = 1445 + 21 = 1466 (Way too large)
*   (85 * 17) - 21 = 1445 - 21 = 1424 (Way too large)

Multiplication of two large numbers makes the result very large. Maybe multiplication with a smaller number or division is more promising.

**Attempt 3: Introducing division**
Division can significantly reduce numbers. Let's see if any divisions result in integers or useful fractions.

*   85 / 17 = 5. This is a nice integer!
    Now I have 5, 21. I need to get 16.
    *   21 - 5 = 16.
    This looks promising! The expression would be 21 - (85 / 17).
    Let's check:
    Numbers used: 21, 85, 17. All used once.
    Operations used: -, /. Allowed.
    Evaluation: 21 - (85 / 17) = 21 - 5 = 16.
    This works!

Let's explore other division possibilities just to be thorough and ensure this is a robust process.

*   85 / 21 (Not an integer, 4.047...)
*   21 / 17 (Not an integer, 1.235...)
*   17 / 21 (Not an integer, 0.809...)
*   17 / 85 (Not an integer, 0.2)
*   21 / 85 (Not an integer, 0.247...)

The division 85 / 17 yielding 5 was the most straightforward path.

Let's consider other structures with division.

*   (21 / ?) ...
*   (? / 21) ...
*   (? / 85) ...
*   (? / 17) ...

What if we try to make one of the numbers smaller first?
*   21 - 17 = 4. Now I have 4 and 85. How to get 16?
    *   85 / 4 (Not integer)
    *   85 + 4 = 89
    *   85 - 4 = 81
    *   4 - 85 = -81
    This path doesn't seem to lead to 16 easily.

*   85 - 21 = 64. Now I have 64 and 17. How to get 16?
    *   64 / 17 (Not integer)
    *   64 + 17 = 81
    *   64 - 17 = 47
    *   17 - 64 = -47
    This path doesn't seem to lead to 16 easily.

*   85 - 17 = 68. Now I have 68 and 21. How to get 16?
    *   68 / 21 (Not integer)
    *   68 + 21 = 89
    *   68 - 21 = 47
    *   21 - 68 = -47
    This path doesn't seem to lead to 16 easily.

Let's revisit the successful path: 21 - (85 / 17).
Numbers: 21, 85, 17. Used once.
Operations: -, /. Allowed.
Result: 21 - 5 = 16. Correct.

Could there be another solution?
Let's try to get 16 by multiplying something by a small number.
For example, if we could get 8, then 8 * 2 = 16. But we don't have a 2.
If we could get 4, then 4 * 4 = 16.
If we could get 2, then 2 * 8 = 16.

Let's try to construct 4.
*   21 - 17 = 4. We used 21 and 17. We have 85 left.
    Can we combine 4 and 85 to get 16? No obvious way.
    What if we did (21 - 17) * (something with 85)?
    (21 - 17) * (85 / ?) - this requires another number.
    (21 - 17) + (85 / ?) - this requires another number.

Let's try to construct 8.
*   85 - ? = 8 (Need 77, not available)
*   21 - ? = 8 (Need 13, not available)
*   17 - ? = 8 (Need 9, not available)
*   ? - 21 = 8 (Need 29, not available)
*   ? - 17 = 8 (Need 25, not available)
*   ? - 85 = 8 (Need 93, not available)

Let's try to construct 2.
*   21 - 17 = 4. Then 4 / 2 = 2. But we don't have a 2.
*   85 / ? = 2 (Need 42.5, not available)
*   21 / ? = 2 (Need 10.5, not available)
*   17 / ? = 2 (Need 8.5, not available)

The division 85 / 17 = 5 seems to be the most direct route to a small integer that can be combined with the remaining number (21) to reach the target (16).

Let's consider the structure (A op B) op C = 16.
We found (21 - (85 / 17)) = 16.

What about A op (B op C) = 16?
*   21 - (85 - 17) = 21 - 68 = -47
*   21 - (85 + 17) = 21 - 102 = -81
*   21 - (85 * 17) = 21 - 1445 = -1424

Possible combinations:

Let's try combining two numbers and then operating with the remaining two.

Try starting with the largest number, 87.
If I subtract something from 87, I need to get a number that can be formed by the remaining numbers to reach 79.
87 - X = 79 => X = 8. Can I make 8 from [68, 37, 23]?
68 - 37 - 23 = 31 - 23 = 8. Yes!
So, 87 - (68 - 37 - 23) = 87 - (31 - 23) = 87 - 8 = 79.
This uses all numbers: 87, 68, 37, 23.
The operations are subtraction.

Let's verify the order of operations.
87 - (68 - 37 - 23)
First, 68 - 37 = 31.
Then, 31 - 23 = 8.
Finally, 87 - 8 = 79.
This looks correct.

Let's try another approach to be sure.
What if I add two numbers and then subtract/add the others?
68 + 23 = 91.
Can I get 79 from 91 using 87 and 37?
91 - 87 = 4. Need to use 37. 4 + 37 = 41 (no). 4 - 37 = -33 (no). 37 - 4 = 33 (no).
91 + 87 = 178. Need to use 37. (no)

What if I multiply two numbers?
Let's try to get a number close to 79 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others.
No direct multiplication seems helpful as the numbers are relatively large.

Let's go back to the subtraction idea.
87 - (something) = 79. The something must be 8.
We found 68 - 37 - 23 = 8.
So, 87 - (68 - 37 - 23) = 79.

What if we try to get 79 by adding?
X + Y + Z + W = 79. This is unlikely with these numbers.

What if we try to get a number slightly larger than 79 and subtract?
For example, 87 + 23 = 110.
Can we get 110 - X = 79? X = 31.
Can we make 31 from [68, 37]?
68 - 37 = 31. Yes.
So, (87 + 23) - (68 - 37) = 110 - 31 = 79.
This also uses all numbers: 87, 23, 68, 37.
Operations: +, -, -.

Let's check this one:
(87 + 23) - (68 - 37)
First, 87 + 23 = 110.
Second, 68 - 37 = 31.
Finally, 110 - 31 = 79.
This is also a valid solution.

The problem asks for ""a"" mathematical equation. Both are valid.
The first one found: 87 - (68 - 37 - 23)
The second one found: (87 + 23) - (68 - 37)

Let's consider if there are any division possibilities.
If we divide first, the numbers get smaller.
For example, 68 / 23 is not an integer.
37 / 23 is not an integer.

What if we combine numbers to make a divisor?
For example, can we make 2 from the other numbers to divide 37 or 23? No.

Let's stick with the two solutions found using only addition and subtraction.
87 - (68 - 37 - 23) = 79
(87 + 23) - (68 - 37) = 79

The first one is slightly more concise in terms of parenthesis.
87 - (68 - 37 - 23)

Let's try to see if we can get 79 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others.
No obvious pairs multiply to something near 79.

Let's try to get a number that, when divided by one of the numbers, gives a useful result.
For example, if we could make 158, then 158 / 2 = 79. But we don't have 2.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution: 87 - (68 - 37 - 23).
This is a good solution.

Let's re-evaluate the second solution: (87 + 23) - (68 - 37).
This is also a good solution.

Are there any other simple combinations?
What if we try to make 79 directly?
87 - 8 = 79. We need to make 8 from [68, 37, 23]. We did this: 68 - 37 - 23 = 8.
So, 87 - (68 - 37 - 23) = 79.

What if we try to make a number that, when added to another, gives 79?
For example, X + Y = 79.
If X = 68, Y = 11. Can we make 11 from [87, 37, 23]?
87 - 37 - 23 = 50 - 23 = 27 (no).
37 - 23 = 14. 87 - 14 = 73 (no).

If X = 37, Y = 42. Can we make 42 from [87, 68, 23]?
87 - 68 = 19. 19 + 23 = 42. Yes!
So, 37 + (87 - 68 + 23) = 37 + (19 + 23) = 37 + 42 = 79.
This uses all numbers: 37, 87, 68, 23.
Operations: +, -, +.

Let's check this one:
37 + (87 - 68 + 23)
First, 87 - 68 = 19.
Second, 19 + 23 = 42.
Finally, 37 + 42 = 79.
This is also a valid solution.

So we have three valid solutions:
1. 87 - (68 - 37 - 23) = 79
2. (87 + 23) - (68 - 37) = 79
3. 37 + (87 - 68 + 23) = 79

Let's list the numbers: 12, 59, 9, 54.
The target is 51.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to get 51.
I should consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Parentheses can be used to control the order.

Let's try some combinations.

Strategy 1: Try to get close to 51 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.
- 59 is the largest number.
- 54 is also large.
- 12 and 9 are smaller.

Possibility 1: Start with 59.

    - (12*9) / 54 = 108 / 54 = 2. Not 8.
    - (54/9) - 12 = 6 - 12 = -6. Not 8.
    - 12 - (54/9) = 12 - 6 = 6. Not 8.
    - 9 - (54/12) - not integer.
    - 12 + 9 + 54 = 75.
    - 54 - 12 - 9 = 33.
    - 54 + 12 - 9 = 57.
    - 54 + 9 - 12 = 51. Aha! This uses 54, 9, 12. But I need to use 59 too.
    - Let's check: 54 + 9 - 12 = 51. This is a valid calculation, but it doesn't use 59.

Let's go back to 59.
- 59 - (something from 12, 9, 54) = 51. The something must be 8.
    - Can I make 8 from 12, 9, 54?
        - (54 / 9) + 12 = 6 + 12 = 18.
        - 12 - (54 / 9) = 12 - 6 = 6.
        - (12 * 9) / 54 = 108 / 54 = 2.
        - 54 / (12 - 9) = 54 / 3 = 18.

890,664,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 47, 38, and 25 to equal 34. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  (47 - 38) + 25 = 9 + 25 = 34. This works!
2.  (47 + 38) - 25 = 85 - 25 = 60. Not 34.
3.  (47 * 38) / 25 - This will likely result in a non-integer or a very large number.
4.  47 - (38 - 25) = 47 - 13 = 34. This also works!

10. 25 + (38 - 47) = 25 + (-9) = 16. Not 34.

I have found two valid equations:

2361,1089,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 37, 43, 21, and 25 exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a final result of 24.

I need to explore various combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations. The target number, 24, is relatively small, which suggests that division or subtraction might play a significant role in reducing larger intermediate results.

Let's list the numbers: {37, 43, 21, 25}.
The target is 24.

Possible strategies:
1. Try to get close to 24 with two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
2. Combine numbers to create larger intermediate values and then divide or subtract to reach 24.
3. Look for combinations that might result in factors of 24 (like 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12).

Let's start by trying some simple combinations.

Trial 1: Using multiplication first.
(37 * 43) is too large.
(37 * 21) is too large.
(37 * 25) is too large.
(43 * 21) is too large.
(43 * 25) is too large.
(21 * 25) is too large.

This suggests that direct multiplication of two numbers is unlikely to be the first step unless followed by significant division.

Trial 2: Using division.
Can any number be divided by another to get a useful integer?
43 / 37 - not integer
43 / 21 - not integer
43 / 25 - not integer
37 / 21 - not integer
37 / 25 - not integer
21 / 37 - not integer
21 / 43 - not integer
21 / 25 - not integer
25 / 37 - not integer
25 / 43 - not integer
25 / 21 - not integer

This means division will likely occur later in the expression, or it will involve intermediate results.

Trial 3: Focusing on subtraction to reduce large numbers.
The largest numbers are 37 and 43.
43 - 37 = 6. Now I have {6, 21, 25} to get 24.
Can I get 24 from {6, 21, 25}?
6 + 21 + 25 = 52 (too large)
6 * 21 = 126 (too large)
6 * 25 = 150 (too large)
21 + 25 = 46. 46 - 6 = 40.
25 - 21 = 4. 4 + 6 = 10.
21 - 6 = 15. 15 + 25 = 40.
25 - 6 = 19. 19 + 21 = 40.
This path (43 - 37) doesn't seem promising.

Let's try another subtraction:

37 - 21 = 16. 18 + 16 = 34.
37 - 18 = 19. 19 + 21 = 40.
21 - 18 = 3. 3 + 37 = 40.
This path (43 - 25) doesn't seem promising.

43 - 21 = 22. Now I have {22, 37, 25} to get 24.
37 - 25 = 12. 22 + 12 = 34.
37 - 22 = 15. 15 + 25 = 40.
25 - 22 = 3. 3 + 37 = 40.
This path (43 - 21) doesn't seem promising.

37 - 25 = 12. Now I have {12, 43, 21} to get 24.
43 - 21 = 22. 12 + 22 = 34.
43 - 12 = 31. 31 - 21 = 10.
21 - 12 = 9. 9 + 43 = 52.

43 - 25 = 18. 16 + 18 = 34.
43 - 16 = 27. 27 - 25 = 2.
25 - 16 = 9. 9 + 43 = 52.
This path (37 - 21) doesn't seem promising.

25 - 21 = 4. Now I have {4, 37, 43} to get 24.
43 - 37 = 6. 4 + 6 = 10.
43 - 4 = 39. 39 - 37 = 2.
37 - 4 = 33. 33 - 43 = -10.
This path (25 - 21) doesn't seem promising.

Trial 4: Looking for combinations that might lead to factors of 24.
Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

Can I make 12?
37 - 25 = 12. Remaining: {43, 21}. Target: 24.
Can I get 24 from {12, 43, 21}?
12 + (43 - 21) = 12 + 22 = 34.
(43 - 21) / 12 = 22 / 12 (not integer)
(43 + 21) / 12 = 64 / 12 (not integer)
(43 * 21) / 12 (too large)

Can I make 8?
43 - 37 = 6. Need to get 8 from {6, 21, 25}. No obvious way.
21 - ? = 8. 21 - 13. No 13.
25 - ? = 8. 25 - 17. No 17.

Can I make 6?
43 - 37 = 6. Remaining: {21, 25}. Target: 24.
Can I get 24 from {6, 21, 25}?
6 + 21 + 25 = 52.
6 * (25 - 21) = 6 * 4 = 24.
This looks promising!
The numbers used are 43, 37, 25, 21.
The operations are -, *, -.
Let's check the order:
(43 - 37) * (25 - 21)
= 6 * 4
= 24.

This uses all numbers {37, 43, 21, 25} exactly once.
It uses operations -, *, -.
The result is 24.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities or if this is the most straightforward.

Consider the numbers again: {37, 43, 21, 25}. Target: 24.
The pair (43, 37) gives 6.
The pair (25, 21) gives 4.
Multiplying these results gives 24.
This seems like a very clean solution.

Let's try another approach just to be sure.
What if we try to make a number that divides nicely into a larger number?
For example, can we make 3?
21 / 7. No 7.
25 - 22. No 22.

116 + 11 - 27 = 100.

94 - 22 = 72. Numbers left: [27, 11]. Target: 33.
72 - 27 - 11 = 34 (close!)
Let's check: 72 - (27 + 11) = 72 - 38 = 34.
This is very close. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation or there's a slight variation.
Let's re-evaluate 72 - 27 - 11.
(94 - 22) - 27 - 11 = 72 - 27 - 11 = 45 - 11 = 34.

What if I did (94 - 22) - (27 - 11)?
72 - 16 = 56. No.

What if I did (94 - 22) - (27 + 11)?
72 - 38 = 34. Still 34.

Let's try 94 / 22 (not integer).

Let's try combining 94 and 11.
94 + 11 = 105. Numbers left: [27, 22]. Target: 33.

The target number is 19. The available numbers are 11, 57, and 14.
I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations:
1.  Start with the largest number, 57.
    *   57 - 11 = 46. Then 46 / 14? Not an integer.
    *   57 - 14 = 43. Then 43 + 11 = 54. Too high. 43 - 11 = 32. Too high. 43 * 11? Too high. 43 / 11? Not integer.
    *   57 + 11 = 68. Then 68 - 14 = 54. Too high. 68 + 14 = 82. Too high. 68 * 14? Too high. 68 / 14? Not integer.
    *   57 + 14 = 71. Then 71 - 11 = 60. Too high. 71 + 11 = 82. Too high. 71 * 11? Too high. 71 / 11? Not integer.
    *   57 * 11 = 627. Too high.
    *   57 * 14 = 798. Too high.
    *   57 / 11? Not integer.
    *   57 / 14? Not integer.

2.  Try combining the smaller numbers first.
    *   11 + 14 = 25. Then 25 - 57 = -32. Not 19. 25 + 57 = 82. Not 19. 25 * 57? Too high. 25 / 57? Not integer.
    *   11 - 14 = -3. Then -3 + 57 = 54. Not 19. -3 - 57 = -60. Not 19. -3 * 57 = -171. Not 19. -3 / 57? Not integer.
    *   14 - 11 = 3. Then 3 + 57 = 60. Not 19. 3 - 57 = -54. Not 19. 3 * 57 = 171. Not 19. 3 / 57? Not integer.
    *   11 * 14 = 154. Then 154 - 57 = 97. Not 19. 154 + 57 = 211. Not 19. 154 / 57? Not integer.
    *   11 / 14? Not integer.
    *   14 / 11? Not integer.

3.  Let's try division involving 57.
    *   57 / 3 = 19. Can I make 3 from 11 and 14? Yes, 14 - 11 = 3.
    *   So, (14 - 11) = 3.
    *   Then 57 / (14 - 11) = 57 / 3 = 19.
    *   This uses 57, 14, and 11 exactly once.
    *   The operations used are -, /.
    *   The result is 19.

Let's double check the order of operations.
57 / (14 - 11)
First, the parenthesis: 14 - 11 = 3.
Then, the division: 57 / 3 = 19.
This works.

Another possibility:
Can I make 19 by adding/subtracting from a product?
*   11 * 57 = 627. Too big.
*   11 * 14 = 154. Too big.
*   57 * 14 = 798. Too big.

What if I use division on one of the numbers first?
*   57 / 11? Not integer.
*   57 / 14? Not integer.
*   11 / 57? Not integer.
*   14 / 57? Not integer.
*   11 / 14? Not integer.
*   14 / 11? Not integer.

The combination 57 / (14 - 11) seems to be the most straightforward and correct.
Let's consider other ways to arrange it.
(57 / (14 - 11)) = 19. This is the same.
What about (14 - 11) / 57? That would be 3 / 57, not 19.

Let's try to get 19 by adding/subtracting from a number close to 19.
*   11 + 14 = 25. 25 - 57 = -32.
*   11 + 57 = 68. 68 - 14 = 54.
*   14 + 57 = 71. 71 - 11 = 60.
*   11 - 14 = -3. -3 + 57 = 54.
*   14 - 11 = 3. 3 + 57 = 60.
*   57 - 11 = 46. 46 - 14 = 32.
*   57 - 14 = 43. 43 - 11 = 32.

Consider multiplication as the last step.
To get 19, I'd need factors of 19. 19 is prime. So, one factor must be 19 and the other 1.
Can I make 1 from the remaining numbers?
*   If I have 19 * 1, I need to make 19 from two numbers and 1 from the third.
    *   Make 19 from 57 and 14? No easy way.
    *   Make 1 from 11 and 14? 14-11=3, 11-14=-3, 11*14=154, 11/14, 14/11. No 1.
    *   Make 1 from 11 and 57? No easy way.
    *   Make 1 from 14 and 57? No easy way.

Consider division as the last step.
We already found 57 / (14 - 11) = 19.

Consider addition as the last step.
A + B = 19.
*   If A = 11, B must be 8. Can I make 8 from 57 and 14? 57-14=43, 57+14=71, 57*14, 57/14, 14/57. No.
*   If A = 14, B must be 5. Can I make 5 from 11 and 57? 57-11=46, 57+11=68, 57*11, 57/11, 11/57. No.
*   If A = 57, B must be -38. Can I make -38 from 11 and 14? 11-14=-3, 14-11=3, 11+14=25, 11*14=154. No.

Consider subtraction as the last step.
A - B = 19.
*   If A = 57, B must be 38. Can I make 38 from 11 and 14? 11+14=25, 11*14=154, 14-11=3, 11-14=-3. No.
*   If A = 14, B must be -5. Can I make -5 from 11 and 57? 11-57=-46, 57-11=46, 11+57=68, 11*57=627. No.

1144,103,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 88, 29, 75, and 53 to reach the target number 95. Each number must be used exactly once, and only the operations +, -, *, / are allowed.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: [88, 29, 75, 53]
Target: 95

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to get 95. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to the target.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers that are factors or multiples of numbers close to 95.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers ending in 5 or 0, as 95 ends in 5.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.
Maybe (88 / something) or (75 / something).
88 / 29 is not an integer.
88 / 75 is not an integer.
88 / 53 is not an integer.
75 / 29 is not an integer.
75 / 53 is not an integer.
29 * 53 is too large.
29 * 75 is too large.
29 * 88 is too large.
53 * 75 is too large.
53 * 88 is too large.
75 * 88 is too large.

This suggests multiplication might not be the first operation with the largest numbers.

Attempt 2: Try combining smaller numbers first.
29 + 53 = 82. Remaining: [88, 75]. 82 + 88 - 75 = 95. This looks promising!
Let's check:
(29 + 53) + 88 - 75
82 + 88 - 75
170 - 75 = 95.
This works! All numbers are used once, and only allowed operations are used.

Let's verify the order of operations.
(29 + 53) + 88 - 75 = 95. This is a valid equation.

Let's try another path to be sure.

Attempt 3: What if I try to get a number close to 95 directly?
88 + 75 = 163. Remaining: [29, 53]. 163 - 29 - 53 = 163 - 82 = 81. Not 95.
88 - 75 = 13. Remaining: [29, 53]. 13 + 29 + 53 = 13 + 82 = 95. This also works!
Let's check:
(88 - 75) + 29 + 53
13 + 29 + 53
42 + 53 = 95.
This is also a valid equation.

The user asked for *an* equation. Both are valid. I'll present the first one I found.

Let's re-check the first solution: (29 + 53) + 88 - 75 = 95.
Numbers used: 29, 53, 88, 75. All used once.
Operations used: +, +, -. Allowed.
Result: 95. Correct.

Let's re-check the second solution: (88 - 75) + 29 + 53 = 95.
Numbers used: 88, 75, 29, 53. All used once.
Operations used: -, +, +. Allowed.
Result: 95. Correct.

I will present the first one found.
(29 + 53) + 88 - 75 = 95.
I can also write it as 88 + (29 + 53) - 75 = 95 or 88 - 75 + 29 + 53 = 95.
The order of addition doesn't matter.
Let's stick to the order I derived it: (29 + 53) + 88 - 75.

Consider other possibilities:
What if I try to make a number close to 100?
88 + 29 = 117. Remaining [75, 53]. 117 - 75 + 53 = 42 + 53 = 95. This is the same as the second solution, just reordered.
88 + 53 = 141. Remaining [29, 75]. 141 - 75 + 29 = 66 + 29 = 95. This is another valid solution.
Let's check: (88 + 53) - 75 + 29 = 95.
141 - 75 + 29
66 + 29 = 95.
This is also valid.

Let's try to use division.
Can I make a number that divides nicely?
Maybe 75 / 5 = 15? But I don't have 5.
Maybe 88 / 2 = 44? No 2.
Maybe 88 / 4 = 22? No 4.
Maybe 88 / 8 = 11? No 8.
Maybe 88 / 11 = 8? No 11.
Maybe 88 / 22 = 4? No 22.
Maybe 88 / 44 = 2? No 44.

Let's try to get a number that, when multiplied, gets close.
If I have 5 * 19 = 95. Can I make 5 and 19?
From [88, 29, 75, 53].
To make 5: 29 - ? No. 53 - ? No. 75 - ? No.
To make 19: 29 - 10? No 10. 53 - 34? No 34. 75 - 56? No 56.

Let's go back to the additive/subtractive solutions.
Solution 1: (29 + 53) + 88 - 75 = 95
Solution 2: (88 - 75) + 29 + 53 = 95
Solution 3: (88 + 53) - 75 + 29 = 95

All are valid. I'll pick one that looks reasonably straightforward.
(88 - 75) + 29 + 53 = 95 seems quite direct.
Or 88 + 29 + 53 - 75 = 95.
Or 88 + 53 + 29 - 75 = 95.

Let's try to use multiplication in a different way.
Maybe (something * something) + something - something.
Try to make a number close to 95 using two numbers.
88 + 75 = 163
88 + 53 = 141
88 + 29 = 117
75 + 53 = 128

88 - 53 = 35
88 - 29 = 59
75 - 53 = 22
75 - 29 = 46

The user wants me to find an equation using the numbers [20, 25, 70, 14] and the operations +, -, *, / to reach the target value of 14. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 20, 25, 70, 14.
Target: 14.

I need to combine these four numbers. I can try different combinations and operations.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can reduce them.
2. Try to create 14 directly or a number close to it and then adjust.
3. Consider division first, as it can significantly reduce numbers.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using 70 and 20.
70 / 20 = 3.5 (not an integer, might be tricky)
70 - 20 = 50
70 + 20 = 90
70 * 20 = 1400

Attempt 2: Using 70 and 14.
70 / 14 = 5. This looks promising.
If I have 5, I need to use 20 and 25 to get to 14.
So, (70 / 14) = 5.
Remaining numbers: 20, 25.
Target from 5: Need to get 14 from 5 using 20 and 25.
This means I need to combine 20 and 25 to get 14 - 5 = 9, or 14 + 5 = 19, or 5 - 14 = -9, or 14 * 5 = 70, or 5 / 14.
Can I get 9 from 20 and 25?
25 - 20 = 5 (No)
25 + 20 = 45 (No)
25 * 20 = 500 (No)
20 / 25 (No)
25 / 20 (No)

Let's try another approach with 70 / 14 = 5.
Maybe the 5 is part of a larger calculation.
What if I need to add something to 5 to get 14? That would be 9. Can I make 9 from 20 and 25? No.
What if I need to subtract something from 5 to get 14? That would be -9. Can I make -9 from 20 and 25? No.
What if I need to multiply 5 by something to get 14? That would be 14/5 = 2.8. Can I make 2.8 from 20 and 25? No.
What if I need to divide 5 by something to get 14? That would be 5/14. Can I make 5/14 from 20 and 25? No.

Let's reconsider 70 / 14 = 5.
What if the 5 is multiplied by something?
If I have 5, and I need to reach 14 using 20 and 25.
Maybe the 5 is multiplied by a result from 20 and 25.
Let's try to make 14 using 20 and 25 first.
25 - 20 = 5.
So, I have 5 and 14 and 70.
Can I combine 5, 14, 70 to get 14?
(25 - 20) = 5.
Remaining: 5, 14, 70. Target: 14.
Try combining 5 and 70:
70 / 5 = 14.
So, (70 / (25 - 20)) = 14.
This uses 70, 25, 20. I still need to use 14.
This doesn't work because I used 70, 25, 20 and got 14, but I didn't use the number 14 itself.

Let's try another path.
Numbers: 20, 25, 70, 14. Target: 14.

What if 14 is the result of a division?
Maybe something / something = 14.
Or something - something = 14.
Or something + something = 14.
Or something * something = 14.

Let's try to make 14 using 70 and 20.
70 - 20 = 50. Remaining: 25, 14. Target from 50: 14.
50 + 25 = 75. 75 + 14 = 89.
50 - 25 = 25. 25 + 14 = 39.
50 * 25 = 1250.
50 / 25 = 2. 2 + 14 = 16. Close.
50 / 25 = 2. 14 - 2 = 12. Close.
50 / 25 = 2. 14 * 2 = 28.
50 / 25 = 2. 2 / 14 (No)

Let's try 70 and 25.
70 - 25 = 45. Remaining: 20, 14. Target from 45: 14.
45 - 20 = 25. 25 + 14 = 39.
45 + 20 = 65. 65 + 14 = 79.
45 * 20 = 900.
45 / 20 (No)

Let's try 70 and 14.
70 / 14 = 5. Remaining: 20, 25. Target from 5: 14.
We already explored this.

Let's try 20 and 25.
25 - 20 = 5. Remaining: 70, 14. Target from 5: 14.
Can we combine 70 and 14 with 5 to get 14?
(70 / 14) = 5. So we have 5 and 5. Can't use 14.
(70 + 14) = 84. 84 + 5 = 89.
(70 - 14) = 56. 56 + 5 = 61.
(70 * 14) = 980. 980 + 5 = 985.
(70 / 14) = 5. 5 + 5 = 10.
(70 / 14) = 5. 5 - 5 = 0.
(70 / 14) = 5. 5 * 5 = 25.
(70 / 14) = 5. 5 / 5 = 1.

Let's try 20 and 14.
20 - 14 = 6. Remaining: 70, 25. Target from 6: 14.
70 / 25 (No)
70 - 25 = 45. 45 + 6 = 51.
70 + 25 = 95. 95 + 6 = 101.

Let's try 25 and 14.
25 - 14 = 11. Remaining: 70, 20. Target from 11: 14.
70 / 20 (No)
70 - 20 = 50. 50 + 11 = 61.
70 + 20 = 90. 90 + 11 = 101.

Let's try multiplication first.
20 * 25 = 500. Remaining: 70, 14. Target from 500: 14.
500 / 70 (No)
500 - 70 = 430. 430 + 14 = 444.
500 + 70 = 570. 570 + 14 = 584.

20 * 70 = 1400. Remaining: 25, 14. Target from 1400: 14.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 31, 1, 68, and 44 to reach the target value of 82.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combining the numbers.
Target: 82

Possible combinations:
- Start with the largest numbers: 68 and 44.
  - 68 + 44 = 112 (Too high)
  - 68 - 44 = 24 (Too low)
  - 44 - 68 = -24 (Too low)
  - 68 * 44 (Too high)
  - 68 / 44 (Not a whole number, unlikely to be useful)
  - 44 / 68 (Not a whole number)

- Let's try combining 68 with the smaller numbers first.
  - 68 + 31 = 99
    - Need to get from 99 to 82 using 1 and 44.
    - 99 - 1 = 98. Need to get from 98 to 82 using 44. 98 - 44 = 54 (No)
    - 99 - 44 = 55. Need to get from 55 to 82 using 1. 55 + 1 = 56 (No)
    - 99 + 1 = 100. Need to get from 100 to 82 using 44. 100 - 44 = 56 (No)
    - 99 + 44 = 143. Need to get from 143 to 82 using 1. 143 - 1 = 142 (No)

  - 68 - 31 = 37
    - Need to get from 37 to 82 using 1 and 44.
    - 37 + 1 = 38. Need to get from 38 to 82 using 44. 38 + 44 = 82. This works!
    - Equation: (68 - 31) + 1 + 44 = 37 + 1 + 44 = 38 + 44 = 82.
    - Let's check if all numbers are used: 68, 31, 1, 44. Yes.
    - Let's check operations: -, +, +. Yes.

Let's try another path to confirm.
- 68 + 1 = 69
  - Need to get from 69 to 82 using 31 and 44.
  - 69 + 31 = 100. Need to get from 100 to 82 using 44. 100 - 44 = 56 (No)
  - 69 + 44 = 113. Need to get from 113 to 82 using 31. 113 - 31 = 82. This works!
  - Equation: (68 + 1) + 44 - 31 = 69 + 44 - 31 = 113 - 31 = 82.
  - Let's check if all numbers are used: 68, 1, 44, 31. Yes.
  - Let's check operations: +, +, -. Yes.

Both (68 - 31) + 1 + 44 and (68 + 1) + 44 - 31 work. I'll pick one.
The first one seems slightly simpler in terms of order of operations.

Let's verify the first one again:
Numbers: [31, 1, 68, 44]
Target: 82
Equation: (68 - 31) + 1 + 44
Step 1: 68 - 31 = 37
Step 2: 37 + 1 = 38
Step 3: 38 + 44 = 82
All numbers used: 68, 31, 1, 44.
Operations used: -, +, +.
Result is 82.

Let's verify the second one again:
Numbers: [31, 1, 68, 44]
Target: 82
Equation: (68 + 1) + 44 - 31
Step 1: 68 + 1 = 69
Step 2: 69 + 44 = 113
Step 3: 113 - 31 = 82
All numbers used: 68, 1, 44, 31.
Operations used: +, +, -.
Result is 82.

I will present the first one.
(68 - 31) + 1 + 44 = 82
Or, without explicit parentheses if order of operations is assumed:
68 - 31 + 1 + 44 = 82
Let's check if the user wants explicit parentheses. ""Place the final equation inside <answer></answer>"".
The first one is clear.

Consider other possibilities:
- 44 * 1 = 44
  - Need to get from 44 to 82 using 31 and 68.
  - 44 + 31 = 75. Need to get from 75 to 82 using 68. 75 + 68 = 143 (No). 75 - 68 = 7 (No).
  - 44 + 68 = 112. Need to get from 112 to 82 using 31. 112 - 31 = 81 (Close, but no).
  - 44 - 31 = 13. Need to get from 13 to 82 using 68. 13 + 68 = 81 (Close, but no).
  - 44 - 68 = -24. Need to get from -24 to 82 using 31. -24 + 31 = 7 (No).

- 31 * 1 = 31
  - Need to get from 31 to 82 using 68 and 44.
  - 31 + 68 = 99. Need to get from 99 to 82 using 44. 99 - 44 = 55 (No).
  - 31 + 44 = 75. Need to get from 75 to 82 using 68. 75 + 68 = 143 (No). 75 - 68 = 7 (No).

- 68 / 1 = 68
  - Need to get from 68 to 82 using 31 and 44.
  - 68 + 31 = 99. Need to get from 99 to 82 using 44. 99 - 44 = 55 (No).
  - 68 + 44 = 112. Need to get from 112 to 82 using 31. 112 - 31 = 81 (No).

The first solution found seems robust.
(68 - 31) + 1 + 44 = 82
Let's write it without the outer parentheses, as addition is associative.
68 - 31 + 1 + 44 = 82
This uses 68, 31, 1, 44.
Operations: -, +, +.
Result: 82.

Another option:
44 + 31 + 1 + 6 = 82 (Oops, 6 is not in the list)

Let's re-check the second solution:
(68 + 1) + 44 - 31 = 82
69 + 44 - 31 = 82
113 - 31 = 82
This is also valid.

Let's try to use multiplication differently.
(44 + 1) * ?
(44 + 1) * 31 = 45 * 31 (Too big)
(44 + 1) * 68 (Too big)

(31 + 1) * ?
(31 + 1) * 44 = 32 * 44 (Too big)

4804,629,"<think>The numbers are [94, 54, 6, 53] and the target is 32. I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try to combine the numbers.
The target number 32 is relatively small compared to the given numbers. This suggests that division or subtraction might be important.

Let's try to get close to 32 using pairs of numbers first.
94 - 54 = 40. Then I have 6 and 53 left. 40 + 6 = 46. 46 - 53 = -7. Not 32. 40 - 6 = 34. 34 + 53 = 87. Not 32. 40 * 6 = 240. Too big. 40 / 6 is not an integer.

Let's try multiplication.
6 * 53 = 318. Too big.
6 * 54 = 324. Too big.
6 * 94 = 564. Too big.

Let's try division.
94 / 6 is not an integer.
54 / 6 = 9. Then I have 94 and 53 left. 9 + 94 = 103. 103 - 53 = 50. Not 32. 9 - 94 = -85. -85 + 53 = -32. Close, but negative. 9 + 53 = 62. 62 - 94 = -32. Close, but negative.
54 / 94 is not useful.
53 / 6 is not an integer.
53 / 54 is not useful.
53 / 94 is not useful.

Let's try combining three numbers first.
(94 - 54) = 40. Left: 6, 53. Target: 32.
40 - 6 = 34. Left: 53. 34 - 53 = -19. 34 + 53 = 87.
40 + 6 = 46. Left: 53. 46 - 53 = -7. 46 + 53 = 99.

(94 - 53) = 41. Left: 54, 6. Target: 32.
41 - 54 = -13. Left: 6. -13 + 6 = -7.
41 + 54 = 95. Left: 6. 95 - 6 = 89.
41 - 6 = 35. Left: 54. 35 - 54 = -19.
41 + 6 = 47. Left: 54. 47 - 54 = -7.

(54 - 6) = 48. Left: 94, 53. Target: 32.
48 - 94 = -46. Left: 53. -46 + 53 = 7.
48 + 94 = 142. Left: 53. 142 - 53 = 89.
48 - 53 = -5. Left: 94. -5 + 94 = 89.
48 + 53 = 101. Left: 94. 101 - 94 = 7.

(54 - 53) = 1. Left: 94, 6. Target: 32.
1 + 94 = 95. Left: 6. 95 - 6 = 89.
1 - 94 = -93. Left: 6. -93 + 6 = -87.
1 + 6 = 7. Left: 94. 7 - 94 = -87.

Let's try division first.
54 / 6 = 9. Left: 94, 53. Target: 32.
9 + 94 = 103. 103 - 53 = 50.
9 - 94 = -85. -85 + 53 = -32.
9 + 53 = 62. 62 - 94 = -32.

Let's try to make a number close to 32 and then adjust.
Maybe (94 - 53) = 41. Left: 54, 6. Target: 32.
If I can subtract 9 from 41, I get 32. Can I make 9 from 54 and 6? Yes, 54 / 6 = 9.
So, (94 - 53) - (54 / 6) = 41 - 9 = 32.
This uses all numbers: 94, 53, 54, 6.
Operations used: -, -, /.

Let's check the order of operations.
(94 - 53) - (54 / 6)
First, the parentheses:
94 - 53 = 41
54 / 6 = 9
Then, the subtraction:
41 - 9 = 32.
This works.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
What if we try to make a number slightly larger than 32 and subtract?
For example, if we can make 38, and subtract 6.
Can we make 38 from 94, 54, 53?
(94 + 54) - 53 = 148 - 53 = 95. No.
(94 - 54) + 53 = 40 + 53 = 93. No.
(54 - 53) * 94 = 1 * 94 = 94. No.

What if we try to make a number slightly smaller than 32 and add?
For example, if we can make 26 and add 6.
Can we make 26 from 94, 54, 53?
(94 - 54) - 53 = 40 - 53 = -13. No.
(54 - 53) * ? No.

Let's re-examine the successful attempt: (94 - 53) - (54 / 6) = 32.
This is a valid solution.

Are there other possibilities?
Let's consider the structure of the numbers. 94, 54, 6, 53.
The presence of 54 and 6 suggests division might be useful. 54/6 = 9.
If we have 9, we need to combine 94 and 53 to get 32 - 9 = 23 or 32 + 9 = 41 or 9 - 32 = -23 or 32 * 9 = 288 etc.
Can we make 23 from 94 and 53? 94 - 53 = 41. 53 - 94 = -41. 94 + 53 = 147.

116 + (66 - 50) = 116 + 16 = 132.
116 - 66 = 50. Need to get to 97 using 50. 50 + 50 = 100.
116 - 50 = 66. Need to get to 97 using 66. 66 + 66 = 132.

Let's try division.
Maybe divide a larger number by a smaller one to get a smaller intermediate result.
66 / 6 = 11 (but 6 is not available)
66 / 3 = 22 (but 3 is not available)
50 / 2 = 25 (but 2 is not available)
53 / ?
63 / ?

Let's try combining numbers to make a number that can be multiplied or divided.
Target is 97.

Consider (A * B) + C + D or (A * B) - C - D etc.
Consider (A + B) * C + D or (A + B) * C - D etc.

Let's try to get close to 97 with multiplication.
If we multiply two numbers, the result is usually much larger than 97.
So, maybe multiplication is used on a smaller intermediate result.

Let's try to make a number close to 97 using addition/subtraction first.
66 + 50 - 53 + 63 = 116 - 53 + 63 = 63 + 63 = 126.
66 + 50 + 53 - 63 = 116 + 53 - 63 = 169 - 63 = 106.
66 - 50 + 53 + 63 = 16 + 53 + 63 = 69 + 63 = 132.
66 - 50 - 53 + 63 = 16 - 53 + 63 = -37 + 63 = 26.
66 + 63 - 50 - 53 = 129 - 50 - 53 = 79 - 53 = 26.

Let's try to use division to reduce numbers.
Maybe (66 / X) * Y + Z or similar.

What if we try to make 97 directly?
Maybe something like (X * Y) + Z = 97 or (X * Y) - Z = 97.
If X*Y is around 100, then Z could be small.
If X*Y is around 50, then Z could be around 47.

Consider the numbers: 85, 80, 26, 42. Target: 100.

What if we use division to get a smaller number from the larger ones?
80 / 4 = 20 (Need 4)

2884,883,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 64, 30, 42, and 72 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target value of 63.

Let's list the numbers: [64, 30, 42, 72]
Target: 63

I need to combine these four numbers. This means I'll have three operations.

Possible combinations of operations and numbers.
The order of operations matters, so I need to consider parentheses.

Let's try to get close to 63.
64 is close to 63. Maybe I can subtract 1 from 64. How can I get 1 from the remaining numbers (30, 42, 72)?
(42 / 30) is not an integer.
(72 / 30) is not an integer.
(72 / 42) is not an integer.
(30 / 42) is not an integer.
(30 / 72) is not an integer.
(42 / 72) is not an integer.

Let's try combining two numbers first.
72 / 64 - not integer
72 / 30 - not integer
72 / 42 - not integer

42 / 64 - not integer
42 / 72 - not integer
30 / 42 - not integer
30 / 64 - not integer
30 / 72 - not integer

This suggests that division might not be the first operation if I want to avoid fractions early on, unless the division results in a whole number.
Let's check for whole number divisions:
72 / 6 = 12 (but 6 is not in the list)
72 / 3 = 24 (but 3 is not in the list)
72 / 4 = 18 (but 4 is not in the list)
72 / 8 = 9 (but 8 is not in the list)
72 / 9 = 8 (but 9 is not in the list)

72 / 18 = 4 (but 18 is not in the list)
72 / 24 = 3 (but 24 is not in the list)
72 / 36 = 2 (but 36 is not in the list)

64 / 2 = 32
64 / 4 = 16
64 / 8 = 8
64 / 16 = 4
64 / 32 = 2

42 / 2 = 21
42 / 3 = 14
42 / 6 = 7
42 / 7 = 6
42 / 14 = 3
42 / 21 = 2

30 / 2 = 15
30 / 3 = 10
30 / 5 = 6
30 / 6 = 5
30 / 10 = 3
30 / 15 = 2

None of these divisions directly use two numbers from the set to produce a whole number. This means I'll likely have to perform operations that result in intermediate non-integers, or the division is the last step, or the division is part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's try to combine numbers to get factors of 63. Factors of 63 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 63.

The user wants to find an equation using the numbers 14, 14, and 39, and the operations +, -, *, / to reach the target number 38. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [14, 14, 39]
Target: 38

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combining 14 and 14 first.
14 + 14 = 28
14 - 14 = 0
14 * 14 = 196
14 / 14 = 1

Now, let's combine these results with 39.

Case 1: (14 + 14) op 39
   (14 + 14) + 39 = 28 + 39 = 67 (Not 38)
   (14 + 14) - 39 = 28 - 39 = -11 (Not 38)

   (14 + 14) * 39 = 28 * 39 = 1092 (Not 38)
   (14 + 14) / 39 = 28 / 39 (Not an integer, unlikely to reach 38)
   39 / (14 + 14) = 39 / 28 (Not an integer)

Case 2: (14 - 14) op 39
   (14 - 14) + 39 = 0 + 39 = 39 (Close, but not 38)
   39 + (14 - 14) = 39 + 0 = 39 (Same)
   (14 - 14) - 39 = 0 - 39 = -39 (Not 38)
   39 - (14 - 14) = 39 - 0 = 39 (Same)
   (14 - 14) * 39 = 0 * 39 = 0 (Not 38)
   (14 - 14) / 39 = 0 / 39 = 0 (Not 38)
   39 / (14 - 14) = 39 / 0 (Undefined)

Case 3: (14 * 14) op 39

   39 - (14 * 14) = 39 - 196 = -157 (Not 38)
   (14 * 14) * 39 = 196 * 39 (Very large)
   (14 * 14) / 39 = 196 / 39 (Not an integer)
   39 / (14 * 14) = 39 / 196 (Not an integer)

Case 4: (14 / 14) op 39
   (14 / 14) + 39 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Close, but not 38)
   39 + (14 / 14) = 39 + 1 = 40 (Same)
   (14 / 14) - 39 = 1 - 39 = -38 (Close, but negative)
   39 - (14 / 14) = 39 - 1 = 38 (This is it!)

Let's verify: 39 - (14 / 14) = 39 - 1 = 38.
Numbers used: 39, 14, 14. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, /. Basic arithmetic operations.
Result: 38.

Let's also consider the other order for the division: 14 / 14.
The expression is 39 - (14 / 14).

What if we combine 14 and 39 first?
14 + 39 = 53
14 - 39 = -25
39 - 14 = 25
14 * 39 = 546
14 / 39 (Not integer)
39 / 14 (Not integer)

Now combine with the remaining 14.

Case 5: (14 + 39) op 14
   (14 + 39) + 14 = 53 + 14 = 67
   (14 + 39) - 14 = 53 - 14 = 39
   14 - (14 + 39) = 14 - 53 = -39
   (14 + 39) * 14 = 53 * 14 (Large)
   (14 + 39) / 14 = 53 / 14 (Not integer)
   14 / (14 + 39) = 14 / 53 (Not integer)

Case 6: (39 - 14) op 14
   (39 - 14) + 14 = 25 + 14 = 39
   (39 - 14) - 14 = 25 - 14 = 11
   14 - (39 - 14) = 14 - 25 = -11
   (39 - 14) * 14 = 25 * 14 = 350
   (39 - 14) / 14 = 25 / 14 (Not integer)
   14 / (39 - 14) = 14 / 25 (Not integer)

Case 7: (14 * 39) op 14
   (14 * 39) + 14 = 546 + 14 = 560
   (14 * 39) - 14 = 546 - 14 = 532
   14 - (14 * 39) = 14 - 546 = -532
   (14 * 39) / 14 = 546 / 14 = 39
   14 / (14 * 39) = 14 / 546 (Small fraction)

The solution 39 - (14 / 14) = 38 seems correct and is the most straightforward.
Let's double check if there are other possibilities.

Consider the structure a op (b op c).

14 op (39 - 14) = 14 op 25

The user wants me to find an equation using the numbers 62, 82, and 47, and the operators +, -, *, / to reach the target number 67. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [62, 82, 47]
Target: 67

I need to try different combinations of operators and the order of operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combinations:

Try using 62 and 82 first:
- 62 + 82 = 144. 144 op 47 = 67?
    - 144 - 47 = 97 (No)
    - 144 + 47 = 191 (No)
    - 144 * 47 (Too large)
    - 144 / 47 (Not an integer, unlikely)
- 62 - 82 = -20. -20 op 47 = 67?
    - -20 + 47 = 27 (No)
    - -20 - 47 = -67 (No)
- 82 - 62 = 20. 20 op 47 = 67?
    - 20 + 47 = 67 (Yes!)

This looks promising: (82 - 62) + 47 = 67.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 82, 62, 47. Yes.
Let's check the operators: -, +. Yes.
Let's check the target: 67. Yes.

This seems to be the solution.

Let's quickly check other initial combinations to be thorough, though the first one found is usually sufficient for these types of problems.

Try using 62 and 47 first:
- 62 + 47 = 109. 109 op 82 = 67?
    - 109 - 82 = 27 (No)
    - 109 + 82 (Too large)
- 62 - 47 = 15. 15 op 82 = 67?
    - 15 + 82 = 97 (No)
    - 82 - 15 = 67 (Yes!)
    This gives 82 - (62 - 47) = 67.
    Let's check: 82 - (15) = 67. This also works.
    Numbers used: 82, 62, 47. Operators: -, -. Target: 67.

Try using 82 and 47 first:
- 82 + 47 = 129. 129 op 62 = 67?
    - 129 - 62 = 67 (Yes!)
    This gives (82 + 47) - 62 = 67.
    Numbers used: 82, 47, 62. Operators: +, -. Target: 67.

So I have found three possible solutions:
1. (82 - 62) + 47 = 67
2. 82 - (62 - 47) = 67
3. (82 + 47) - 62 = 67

The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I will provide the first one I found as it's the simplest structure.
(82 - 62) + 47 = 67
82 - 62 = 20
20 + 47 = 67.

This is correct.

11. 57 - 36 / 9 = 57 - 4 = 53 (Too low)
12. 57 * 9 + 36 = 513 + 36 = 549 (Too high)

14. 57 / 9 + 36 = 6.33... + 36 (Not an integer)
15. 57 / 36 + 9 = 1.58... + 9 (Not an integer)

The combination 36 / 9 + 57 = 61 works.

Possible combinations:
- Start with the largest number, 69.

I need to combine these four numbers. I can try different combinations and operations.

Possible strategies:
1.  Start with the largest numbers and see if I can reduce them.
2.  Try to create smaller intermediate numbers that might lead to 14.
3.  Look for divisions that result in whole numbers.

    *   20 / ? - same.
    *   47 / ? - same.

Let's try grouping differently.
*   47 - (20 + 63 - 22) = 47 - (83 - 22) = 47 - 61 = -14 (Close, but negative)
*   47 - (63 - 20 - 22) = 47 - (43 - 22) = 47 - 21 = 26 (Too high)

The equation is (63 + 20) - (47 + 22) = 14.

Both solutions are valid. I will provide the first one I found as it's slightly simpler in terms of parenthesis nesting.

Equation 1: (63 - 47) + 20 - 22 = 14
Equation 2: (63 + 20) - (47 + 22) = 14

I'll present the first one.
Step 1: Subtract 47 from 63. (63 - 47 = 16)
Step 2: Add 20 to the result. (16 + 20 = 36)
Step 3: Subtract 22 from the result. (36 - 22 = 14)

1.  **Start with the largest number (76) and try to reduce it.**
    *   76 - ? = 35. This means ? = 76 - 35 = 41. Can we make 41 from 54 and 13?

2.  **Let's try another approach to confirm.**
    *   What if we multiply? 54 * 13 is too large. 76 * 13 is too large. 54 * 76 is too large.
    *   What if we divide? 54 / 13 is not an integer. 76 / 13 is not an integer. 54 / 76 is not an integer.

19 - 71 = -52
71 * 19 = 1349
71 / 19 (not an integer)

Let's try building up to 68.
Maybe a large number minus something.
93 - ? = 68 => ? = 25. Can we make 25 from 19, 77, 71?
77 - 71 + 19 = 6 + 19 = 25.
So, 93 - (77 - 71 + 19) = 93 - (6 + 19) = 93 - 25 = 68.
This uses all numbers and operations. Let's check the order of operations.
93 - (77 - 71 + 19) = 68. This is a valid equation.

Let's try another one just to be sure.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D or similar.

Consider 77.
77 - ? = 68 => ? = 9. Can we make 9 from 19, 93, 71?
93 - 71 - 19 = 22 - 19 = 3. No.
71 - 19 - ? = 9. 52 - ? = 9 => ? = 43. Can we make 43 from 93? No.

Consider 71.
71 - ? = 68 => ? = 3. Can we make 3 from 19, 77, 93?
93 - 77 - 19 = 16 - 19 = -3. Close.
(93 - 77) - 19 = 16 - 19 = -3.
77 - 19 - 93 = 58 - 93 = -35.
19 - 77 + 93 = -58 + 93 = 35.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution: 93 - (77 - 71 + 19) = 68.
Numbers used: 93, 77, 71, 19. All used once.
Operations used: -, -, +. All allowed.
Result: 68.

Let's try to simplify the expression if possible, or find an alternative.
What if we use multiplication?
(77 / 19) is not integer.
(93 / 19) is not integer.
(71 / 19) is not integer.
(77 / 71) is not integer.
(93 / 71) is not integer.
(93 / 77) is not integer.

So division is unlikely to be the first operation unless it results in an integer.
Let's check if any division results in an integer.
None of the numbers divide each other evenly.

So, we are likely looking at combinations of +, -, *.

Let's try starting with multiplication.
19 * 77 = 1463. Too big.
19 * 93 = 1767. Too big.
19 * 71 = 1349. Too big.
77 * 93 = 7161. Too big.
77 * 71 = 5467. Too big.
93 * 71 = 6603. Too big.

This suggests multiplication is likely not the first operation, or it's part of a subtraction from a larger number.

Let's go back to the subtraction idea.
We found 93 - (77 - 71 + 19) = 68.

Let's try another structure.
(A + B) - (C + D)
(93 + 77) - (71 + 19) = 170 - 90 = 80. Close.
(93 + 71) - (77 + 19) = 164 - 96 = 68.
This works!
Numbers used: 93, 71, 77, 19. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, +. All allowed.
Result: 68.

Let's verify the order of operations for (93 + 71) - (77 + 19).
Parentheses first:
93 + 71 = 164
77 + 19 = 96
Then subtraction:
164 - 96 = 68.

This is a valid and perhaps simpler equation than the first one.

Let's try to find one more.
Maybe something like A - B + C * D.
If D is small, like 19.
A - B + C * 19.
Let's try 77 - 93 + 71 * 19. This will be very large.

What about (A - B) * C + D?
(77 - 19) * ? + ? = 58 * ? + ?
58 * 71 + 93 (too big)
58 * 93 + 71 (too big)

What about A * B - C - D?
19 * 77 - 93 - 71 = 1463 - 93 - 71 = 1370 - 71 = 1299. Too big.

Let's stick with the one we found: (93 + 71) - (77 + 19) = 68.
It uses all numbers once and allowed operations.

Let's check the first one again: 93 - (77 - 71 + 19) = 68.
This is also valid.

The prompt asks for ""an equation"". Either is fine.
The second one (93 + 71) - (77 + 19) = 68 seems more straightforward.

Let's consider the possibility of division being used in a way that results in an integer.
For example, if we had (77+19)/X.
(77+19) = 96.
96 / 93 (not integer)
96 / 71 (not integer)

What if we have something like (93 - 19) / X?
93 - 19 = 74.
74 / 77 (not integer)
74 / 71 (not integer)

What if we have (77 - 71) / X?

The user wants an equation that evaluates to 92 using the numbers [2, 56, 2, 9] exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: 2, 56, 2, 9.
The target is 92.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations.
Let's try different combinations and see if I can get close to 92.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest number (56) and see how to get to 92.
   92 - 56 = 36. Can I make 36 from [2, 2, 9]?
   2 * 9 * 2 = 36. Yes!
   So, 56 + (2 * 9 * 2) = 56 + 36 = 92.
   This uses all numbers [2, 56, 2, 9] exactly once.
   The operations are +, *, *.

Let's verify the equation: 56 + (2 * 9 * 2)
Order of operations:
2 * 9 = 18
18 * 2 = 36
56 + 36 = 92.

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's try other combinations just to be sure or to explore alternatives.

What if I multiply 56 by something?
56 * 2 = 112.
From 112, I need to subtract 112 - 92 = 20.
Can I make 20 from [2, 9]?
2 * 9 = 18. No.
9 / 2 is not an integer.
9 + 2 = 11. No.
9 - 2 = 7. No.

What if I multiply 56 by 9? Too large.
56 * 9 = 504.

What if I divide 56 by something?
56 / 2 = 28.
From 28, I need to get to 92. 92 - 28 = 64.
Can I make 64 from [2, 9]?
2 * 9 = 18. No.
(2+9) = 11. No.
(9-2) = 7. No.

56 / 2 = 28.
Can I make 92 from [28, 2, 9]?
28 * 2 = 56. Need 92 - 56 = 36 from 9. No.
28 * 9 = 252. Too large.
28 + 2 = 30. Need 92 - 30 = 62 from 9. No.
28 + 9 = 37. Need 92 - 37 = 55 from 2. No.
28 - 2 = 26. Need 92 - 26 = 66 from 9. No.
28 - 9 = 19. Need 92 - 19 = 73 from 2. No.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: 56 + (2 * 9 * 2).
This uses 56, 2, 9, 2. All numbers are used.
Operations are +, *, *.
Result is 92.

Let's consider the order of operations and parentheses.
The expression 56 + 2 * 9 * 2 is unambiguous due to standard operator precedence (multiplication before addition).
However, to be explicit, parentheses can be used.
56 + (2 * 9 * 2) = 92.
(2 * 9 * 2) + 56 = 92.
56 + ( (2 * 9) * 2 ) = 92.
56 + ( 2 * (9 * 2) ) = 92.

The simplest form is 56 + 2 * 9 * 2.
The user asked for ""an equation"". So, it should be in the form of ""expression = result"".
The prompt asks to ""Place your final equation inside <answer></answer> tags.""

The equation is 56 + 2 * 9 * 2 = 92.
This uses the numbers [2, 56, 2, 9] exactly once.
It uses only +, *, operations.

Let's check if there are other possibilities.
What if we start with 9?
9 * 2 = 18.
From [18, 56, 2], need to get 92.
18 + 56 = 74. Need 92 - 74 = 18 from 2. No.
18 * 56 = too large.
18 + 2 = 20. Need 92 - 20 = 72 from 56. No.
18 * 2 = 36. Need 92 - 36 = 56 from 56. Yes!
So, (9 * 2) * 2 + 56 = 36 + 56 = 92.
This is essentially the same as the first solution, just reordered.
(9 * 2 * 2) + 56 = 92.

What if we use subtraction?
Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 92 and subtract.
56 * 2 = 112.
From [112, 2, 9], need to get 92.
112 - 9 = 103. Need 103 - 92 = 11 from 2. No.
112 - 2 = 110. Need 110 - 92 = 18 from 9. No.
112 - (9 * 2) = 112 - 18 = 94. Close, but not 92.
112 - (9 + 2) = 112 - 11 = 101. No.
112 - (9 - 2) = 112 - 7 = 105. No.

Let's try another multiplication.
9 * 56 = 504. Too big.
2 * 56 = 112.
2 * 9 = 18.
2 * 2 = 4.

Consider 9 * (something).
9 * (2 + 2) = 9 * 4 = 36. Need 92 - 36 = 56 from 56. Yes!
So, 9 * (2 + 2) + 56 = 36 + 56 = 92.
This uses [9, 2, 2, 56]. All numbers used. Operations *, +, +.
This is also a valid solution.

Let's check the first solution again: 56 + 2 * 9 * 2 = 92.
Numbers: 56, 2, 9, 2.
Operations: +, *, *.

Let's check the second solution: 9 * (2 + 2) + 56 = 92.
Numbers: 9, 2, 2, 56.
Operations: *, +, +.

Both are valid. The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I can choose either.
The first one seems slightly more straightforward in terms of calculation without parentheses if we rely on precedence.
56 + 2 * 9 * 2 = 92.

Let's try to use division.
56 / 2 = 28.
Numbers left: [2, 9]. Target from 28: 92. Need 92 - 28 = 64.
Can we make 64 from [2, 9]? No.

56 / 2 = 28.
Numbers left: [2, 9]. Target from 28: 92.
What if we multiply 28 by something?
28 * 2 = 56. Need 92 - 56 = 36 from 9. No.
28 * 9 = 252. Too big.

What if we use the other 2 for division?
56 / 2 = 28.
Numbers left: [2, 9].
Let's try combining 28 with 2 and 9.
(56 / 2) * 9 + 2 = 28 * 9 + 2 = 252 + 2 = 254. No.
(56 / 2) * 2 + 9 = 28 * 2 + 9 = 56 + ",0.0,Answer content is empty.
2564,388,"<think>The target number is 87. The available numbers are 45, 90, 33, and 9. I need to combine these using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's look at the numbers and the target. 87 is relatively close to 90. This suggests that 90 might be a good starting point, and we'll need to subtract something or add a smaller amount.

Option 1: Start with 90.
If we use 90, we need to get -3 from the remaining numbers (45, 33, 9).
Can we get -3 from 45, 33, and 9?
45 - 33 = 12. 12 + 9 = 21. Not -3.
45 + 33 = 78. 78 - 9 = 69. Not -3.
45 * 9 = 405. Too big.
45 / 9 = 5. 5 - 33 = -28. Not -3.
33 - 45 = -12. -12 + 9 = -3. This works!
So, 90 + (33 - 45 + 9) = 90 + (-12 + 9) = 90 + (-3) = 87.
Let's check if all numbers are used: 90, 33, 45, 9. Yes.
Let's check operations: +, -, +. Yes.

Let's try another approach to confirm.

Option 2: Try to get close to 87 using multiplication.
45 * 9 = 405 (too big)
45 * 33 (too big)
90 / 9 = 10. Remaining numbers are 45, 33. 10 + 45 + 33 = 88. Close, but not 87. 10 + 45 - 33 = 22. 10 - 45 + 33 = -2.
90 / 33 (not a whole number)
45 / 9 = 5. Remaining numbers are 90, 33. 5 + 90 - 33 = 62. 5 - 90 + 33 = -52. 5 + 33 - 90 = -52.
33 / 9 (not a whole number)

Option 3: Combine numbers to get a number close to 87.
45 + 33 = 78. Remaining numbers are 90, 9. 78 + 90 + 9 (too big). 78 + 90 - 9 (too big). 78 - 90 + 9 = -3. 78 + 9 - 90 = -3.
45 + 9 = 54. Remaining numbers are 90, 33. 54 + 90 + 33 (too big). 54 + 90 - 33 = 111. 54 - 90 + 33 = -3.
33 + 9 = 42. Remaining numbers are 45, 90. 42 + 45 + 90 (too big). 42 + 45 - 90 = -3. 42 - 45 + 90 = 87. This works!
So, (33 + 9) - 45 + 90 = 42 - 45 + 90 = -3 + 90 = 87.
Let's check if all numbers are used: 33, 9, 45, 90. Yes.
Let's check operations: +, -, +. Yes.

Both (90 + 33 - 45 + 9) and (33 + 9 - 45 + 90) work. The order of addition doesn't strictly matter, but the grouping can.
Let's write the second one more clearly: 90 + (33 + 9) - 45 = 90 + 42 - 45 = 132 - 45 = 87. This also works.

Let's re-evaluate the first one: 90 + (33 - 45 + 9).
33 - 45 = -12.
-12 + 9 = -3.
90 + (-3) = 87. This is correct.

Let's try to use multiplication to get a number close to 87.
9 * 9 = 81 (not allowed to use 9 twice)
9 * 10 = 90 (not allowed to use 10)

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: 90 + (33 - 45 + 9).
This can be written as 90 + 33 - 45 + 9.
Or, 90 - 45 + 33 + 9 = 45 + 33 + 9 = 78 + 9 = 87. This is simpler.
Let's check: 90, 45, 33, 9. All used. Operations: -, +, +. All allowed.

Let's try another one:
(45 / 9) * ?
45 / 9 = 5. Remaining: 90, 33.
5 * 90 = 450 (too big)
5 * 33 = 165 (too big)
5 + 90 + 33 = 128
5 + 90 - 33 = 62
5 - 90 + 33 = -52

Let's try multiplication with 9.
9 * (something)
If we do 9 * (45/?) or 9 * (33/?) or 9 * (90/?)
9 * (45/9) = 9 * 5 = 45. Remaining: 90, 33. 45 + 90 + 33 (too big). 45 + 90 - 33 = 102. 45 - 90 + 33 = -12.

Let's consider the structure (A * B) + C + D or (A * B) - C - D etc.
(9 * 45) ... too big
(9 * 33) ... too big
(9 * 90) ... too big

Let's consider division first.
90 / 9 = 10. Remaining: 45, 33.
10 + 45 + 33 = 88. Close.
10 + 45 - 33 = 22.
10 - 45 + 33 = -2.

45 / 9 = 5. Remaining: 90, 33.
5 + 90 + 33 = 128.
5 + 90 - 33 = 62.
5 - 90 + 33 = -52.

Let's go back to the simple additive/subtractive approach.
We found 90 - 45 + 33 + 9 = 87. This is a valid solution.
Let's check if there's another one.

Consider 45.
45 + 90 = 135. Need to subtract 48 from 33 and 9. 33 + 9 = 42. 33 - 9 = 24. 9 - 33 = -24.
45 + 33 = 78. Need to add 9 from 90 and 9. 90 + 9 = 99. 90 - 9 = 81. 9 - 90 = -81.
45 + 9 = 54. Need to add 33 from 90 and 33. 90 + 33 = 123. 90 - 33 = 57. 33 - 90 = -57.

Consider 33.
33 + 90 = 123. Need to subtract 36 from 45 and 9. 45 - 9 = 36. This works!
So, 33 + 90 - (45 - 9) = 123 - 36 = 87.
Let's check: 33, 90, 45, 9. All used. Operations: +, -, -. All allowed.
This is another valid solution.

The user wants me to find an equation using the numbers 11, 59, and 46, and the operations +, -, *, / to reach the target value of 94. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [11, 59, 46]
Target: 94

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combinations:

Try 1:
(11 + 59) + 46 = 70 + 46 = 116 (Too high)
(11 + 59) - 46 = 70 - 46 = 24 (Too low)
(11 + 59) * 46 = 70 * 46 = 3220 (Too high)
(11 + 59) / 46 = 70 / 46 (Not an integer, unlikely to reach 94)

(11 - 59) + 46 = -48 + 46 = -2 (Too low)
(11 - 59) - 46 = -48 - 46 = -94 (Close, but negative)
(11 - 59) * 46 = -48 * 46 = -2208 (Too low)
(11 - 59) / 46 = -48 / 46 (Not an integer)

(11 * 59) + 46 = 649 + 46 = 695 (Too high)
(11 * 59) - 46 = 649 - 46 = 603 (Too high)
(11 * 59) * 46 = 649 * 46 (Very high)
(11 * 59) / 46 = 649 / 46 (Not an integer)

(11 / 59) ... (Not likely to be useful with integers)

Try 2:
11 + (59 + 46) = 11 + 105 = 116 (Too high)
11 + (59 - 46) = 11 + 13 = 24 (Too low)
11 + (59 * 46) = 11 + 2714 = 2725 (Too high)
11 + (59 / 46) (Not integer)

11 - (59 + 46) = 11 - 105 = -94 (Close, but negative)
11 - (59 - 46) = 11 - 13 = -2 (Too low)
11 - (59 * 46) = 11 - 2714 = -2703 (Too low)
11 - (59 / 46) (Not integer)

11 * (59 + 46) = 11 * 105 = 1155 (Too high)
11 * (59 - 46) = 11 * 13 = 143 (Too high)
11 * (59 * 46) = 11 * 2714 (Very high)
11 * (59 / 46) (Not integer)

Let's try using subtraction to reduce the numbers.
Maybe 59 - 11 = 48. Then 48 and 46.
48 + 46 = 94. This works!
So the numbers are 59, 11, and 46.
The operations are -, +.
The equation is (59 - 11) + 46.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 59, 11, 46 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: -, + (basic arithmetic)
Result: (59 - 11) + 46 = 48 + 46 = 94.
Target achieved.

Let's check other orderings for completeness.
(59 + 46) - 11 = 105 - 11 = 94. This also works!
Numbers used: 59, 46, 11 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic)
Result: (59 + 46) - 11 = 105 - 11 = 94.
Target achieved.

The prompt asks for ""your final, complete equation"". I can present either one. I'll choose the first one I found.

(59 - 11) + 46 = 94

Let's consider if division could be involved.
If we had a number that divides nicely.
For example, if we had 2 and 46, we could do 46/2 = 23.
But here, 11, 59, 46.
59/11 (not integer)
46/11 (not integer)
46/59 (not integer)
11/59 (not integer)
11/46 (not integer)
59/46 (not integer)

What about intermediate results that are divisible?
(59+11)/? = 70/?
(59-11)/? = 48/?
(59*11)/? = 649/?
(46+11)/? = 57/?
(46-11)/? = 35/?
(46*11)/? = 506/?
(59+46)/? = 105/?
(59-46)/? = 13/?
(59*46)/? = 2714/?

Let's re-examine the structure a op (b op c).
11 + (59 - 46) = 11 + 13 = 24
11 - (59 - 46) = 11 - 13 = -2
11 * (59 - 46) = 11 * 13 = 143
11 / (59 - 46) = 11 / 13 (not integer)

59 + (46 - 11) = 59 + 35 = 94. This also works!
Numbers used: 59, 46, 11 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic)
Result: 59 + (46 - 11) = 59 + 35 = 94.
Target achieved.

59 - (46 - 11) = 59 - 35 = 24
59 * (46 - 11) = 59 * 35 = 2065
59 / (46 - 11) = 59 / 35 (not integer)

46 + (59 - 11) = 46 + 48 = 94. This also works!
Numbers used: 46, 59, 11 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic)
Result: 46 + (59 - 11) = 46 + 48 = 94.
Target achieved.

46 - (59 - 11) = 46 - 48 = -2
46 * (59 - 11) = 46 * 48 = 2208
46 / (59 - 11) = 46 / 48 (not integer)

It seems there are multiple valid solutions. I will pick one.
(59 - 11) + 46 = 94

Let's list the numbers: [84, 32, 83, 58]
Target: 12

I need to combine these four numbers using +, -, *, / to get 12.

Let's try some combinations.

Attempt 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(84 - 32) = 52. Now I have 52, 83, 58. How to get 12?
52 + 83 = 135. 135 - 58 = 77. Not 12.
52 - 83 = -31. -31 + 58 = 27. Not 12.
52 * 83 is too large.
52 / 83 is a fraction.

Attempt 2: Try division early.
84 / 32 = 2.625. This is not a whole number, which might make it harder to reach 12 cleanly. Let's avoid fractions for now unless it seems unavoidable.

Attempt 3: Look for numbers that can be combined to get something close to 12 or a factor of 12.
Maybe combine two numbers to get a number that, when combined with the other two, results in 12.

Let's try grouping:
(84 ? 32) ? (83 ? 58) = 12

Consider (83 - 58) = 25.
Now I have 84, 32, 25. Target 12.
84 - 32 = 52. 52 ? 25 = 12? No.
84 + 32 = 116. 116 ? 25 = 12? No.
84 * 32 is too big.
84 / 32 is a fraction.

Consider (84 - 58) = 26.
Now I have 32, 83, 26. Target 12.
83 - 32 = 51. 51 ? 26 = 12? No.
83 + 32 = 115. 115 ? 26 = 12? No.

Consider (83 - 32) = 51.
Now I have 84, 58, 51. Target 12.
84 - 58 = 26. 26 ? 51 = 12? No.

Consider (58 - 32) = 26.
Now I have 84, 83, 26. Target 12.
84 - 83 = 1. 1 ? 26 = 12? No.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe one of the numbers can be used to divide a combination of others.
Or maybe a product is close to a multiple of 12.

Let's try to get a number that divides nicely.
84 / ?
32 / ?
83 / ?
58 / ?

What if we try to make a number that, when multiplied by something, gets us closer?
For example, if we can make 2, then 2 * 6 = 12.
Or if we can make 3, then 3 * 4 = 12.
Or if we can make 4, then 4 * 3 = 12.
Or if we can make 6, then 6 * 2 = 12.

Let's try to make 2.
(84 / ?) = 2? No.
(32 / ?) = 2? No.
(83 / ?) = 2? No.
(58 / ?) = 2? No.

Let's try to make 3.
(84 / ?) = 3? No.
(32 / ?) = 3? No.
(83 / ?) = 3? No.
(58 / ?) = 3? No.

Let's try to make 4.
(84 / ?) = 4? No.
(32 / ?) = 4? Yes, 32 / 8 = 4. But 8 is not available.
(83 / ?) = 4? No.
(58 / ?) = 4? No.

Let's try to make 6.
(84 / ?) = 6? Yes, 84 / 14 = 6. 14 is not available.
(32 / ?) = 6? No.
(83 / ?) = 6? No.
(58 / ?) = 6? No.

What if we try to make a number that, when added/subtracted from another, gives 12?
Example: X + Y = 12.
Or X - Y = 12.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by another, gives 12.
X / Y = 12.
Possible X values: 84, 32, 83, 58.
If X = 84, Y = 84/12 = 7. Not available.
If X = 32, Y = 32/12 = 2.66. Not integer.
If X = 83, Y = 83/12. Not integer.
If X = 58, Y = 58/12. Not integer.

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by another, gives 12.
X * Y = 12.
Possible X values: 84, 32, 83, 58.
If X = 84, Y = 12/84 = 1/7. Not integer.
If X = 32, Y = 12/32 = 3/8. Not integer.
If X = 83, Y = 12/83. Not integer.
If X = 58, Y = 12/58 = 6/29. Not integer.

This suggests that the 12 is likely the result of addition or subtraction, or a division where the numerator is a product or sum/difference.

Let's try to combine two numbers to get a number that, when combined with the other two, results in 12.

Consider the numbers: [84, 32, 83, 58]

Let's try to get a number close to 12 by combining two numbers.
84 - 83 = 1
84 - 58 = 26
84 - 32 = 52
83 - 58 = 25
83 - 32 = 51
58 - 32 = 26

84 + 32 = 116
84 + 83 = 167
84 + 58 = 142
32 + 83 = 115
32 + 58 = 90
83 + 58 = 141

Let's try to use division to reduce numbers.

3592,1822,"<think>The user wants me to find an equation using the numbers [51, 34, 92, 58] and the operations +, -, *, / to equal 65. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 51, 34, 92, 58.
Target: 65.

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with a large number and subtract/add smaller ones.
2. Multiply two numbers and then adjust with the others.
3. Divide two numbers and then adjust.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(92 - 58) + 34 - 51 = 34 + 34 - 51 = 68 - 51 = 17 (Too low)

Attempt 2:
(92 + 58) - 34 - 51 = 150 - 34 - 51 = 116 - 51 = 65.
This looks promising! Let's check the conditions.
Numbers used: 92, 58, 34, 51 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: +, -, - (allowed operations).
Result: 65.

Let's verify the calculation:
92 + 58 = 150
150 - 34 = 116
116 - 51 = 65

This equation works.

Let's try another one just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

Attempt 3:
51 + 34 - 92 + 58 = 85 - 92 + 58 = -7 + 58 = 51 (Too low)

Attempt 4:
(51 * 34) / 92 + 58 = 1734 / 92 + 58.
1734 / 92 is not an integer. 1734 / 92 = 18.847... This path is unlikely to lead to a clean integer result of 65.

Attempt 5:
(92 / 34) * 51 + 58 = (2.705...) * 51 + 58. Not good.

Attempt 6:
(58 / 34) * 92 + 51 = (1.705...) * 92 + 51. Not good.

Attempt 7:
58 + 92 - 34 - 51 = 150 - 34 - 51 = 116 - 51 = 65. This is the same as Attempt 2, just reordered.

Attempt 8:
51 + 58 - 34 - 92 = 109 - 34 - 92 = 75 - 92 = -17.

Attempt 9:
(51 + 92) - 58 - 34 = 143 - 58 - 34 = 85 - 34 = 51.

Attempt 10:
(58 + 34) - 92 + 51 = 92 - 92 + 51 = 0 + 51 = 51.

Attempt 11:
(92 - 34) + 58 - 51 = 58 + 58 - 51 = 116 - 51 = 65.
This is also a valid solution.
Numbers used: 92, 34, 58, 51 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: -, +, - (allowed operations).
Result: 65.

Let's verify the calculation:
92 - 34 = 58
58 + 58 = 116
116 - 51 = 65

Both (92 + 58) - 34 - 51 and (92 - 34) + 58 - 51 work. I will present one of them. The first one found is (92 + 58) - 34 - 51.

Let's double check the prompt requirements:
- Numbers: [51 34 92 58] - used exactly once. Yes.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - used. Yes, +, -, -.
- Evaluates to 65. Yes.
- Critically review. Done.
- Final, verified equation within <answer></answer> tags. Yes.
- Absolutely no other text. Yes.

The equation (92 + 58) - 34 - 51 = 65 is valid.
The equation (92 - 34) + 58 - 51 = 65 is also valid.

I'll use the first one I found.
(92 + 58) - 34 - 51
92 + 58 = 150
150 - 34 = 116
116 - 51 = 65

Let's list the numbers: 87, 68, 37, 23.
Target: 79.

I need to combine these four numbers using +, -, *, / to get 79.

Let's try some combinations.
Maybe start with the largest numbers.
87 - 68 = 19. Then I have 37 and 23 left. 19 + 37 + 23 = 79. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 87, 68, 37, 23 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: -, +, + (standard arithmetic operations).
Result: 87 - 68 + 37 + 23 = 19 + 37 + 23 = 56 + 23 = 79.

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's try another approach to be sure.
What if I try multiplication?
23 * 3 = 69 (not using the numbers)
23 * 4 = 92 (not using the numbers)

Let's try combining two numbers first.

68 / 37 = not integer

37 + 23 = 60
37 - 23 = 14
37 * 23 = large
37 / 23 = not integer

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: 87 - 68 + 37 + 23.
This is a simple and direct solution.

Let's check for order of operations.
(87 - 68) + 37 + 23 = 19 + 37 + 23 = 79.
87 - 68 + (37 + 23) = 87 - 68 + 60 = 19 + 60 = 79.
87 - (68 + 37) + 23 = 87 - 105 + 23 = -18 + 23 = 5. (Incorrect)
87 - 68 + 37 + 23 is evaluated left to right due to same precedence of + and -.
87 - 68 = 19
19 + 37 = 56
56 + 23 = 79.

The equation is valid.
Numbers: 87, 68, 37, 23 (all used once).
Operations: -, +, + (standard).
Result: 79.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  (6 + 39) - 66 = 45 - 66 = -21 (Not 33)
2.  (6 - 39) + 66 = -33 + 66 = 33 (This works!)

5.  (6 * 39) + 66 = 234 + 66 = 300 (Not 33)
6.  (6 * 39) - 66 = 234 - 66 = 168 (Not 33)
7.  (66 - 39) + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 (This also works!)
8.  (66 + 39) - 6 = 105 - 6 = 99 (Not 33)
9.  (66 / 6) + 39 = 11 + 39 = 50 (Not 33)
10. (66 / 6) - 39 = 11 - 39 = -28 (Not 33)
11. (39 / 6) ... not an integer, so likely not useful unless combined with multiplication later.
12. 66 - (39 - 6) = 66 - 33 = 33 (This also works!)
13. 66 - (39 + 6) = 66 - 45 = 21 (Not 33)
14. 39 - (66 - 6) = 39 - 60 = -21 (Not 33)
15. 39 - (66 + 6) = 39 - 72 = -33 (Not 33)
16. 6 - (39 - 66) = 6 - (-27) = 33 (This also works!)
17. 6 - (66 - 39) = 6 - 27 = -21 (Not 33)

I have found several valid equations:
*   (6 - 39) + 66 = 33
*   (66 - 39) + 6 = 33
*   66 - (39 - 6) = 33
*   6 - (39 - 66) = 33

I will choose one of them. (6 - 39) + 66 = 33 seems straightforward.
Let's double check: 6 - 39 = -33. -33 + 66 = 33. Correct.
All numbers (6, 39, 66) are used exactly once.
Only basic operations (+, -) are used.

Another option: 66 - (39 - 6) = 33.
39 - 6 = 33. 66 - 33 = 33. Correct.

Another option: (66 - 39) + 6 = 33.
66 - 39 = 27. 27 + 6 = 33. Correct.

Another option: 6 - (39 - 66) = 33.
39 - 66 = -27. 6 - (-27) = 6 + 27 = 33. Correct.

I will provide one of these. (66 - 39) + 6 = 33 is a good one.

The problem asks for a single equation using the numbers [72, 8, 64, 17] exactly once, along with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to equal 90.

Let's list the numbers: 72, 8, 64, 17.
The target is 90.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations. The order of operations matters, so parentheses will likely be involved.

Let's start by looking at the numbers and the target. 90 is a relatively small number compared to some of the input numbers (72, 64). This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the magnitude of intermediate results.

Possible pairings and initial operations:
- 72 / 8 = 9
- 72 / 64 (not an integer, unlikely to be useful early on unless multiplied by something that makes it an integer)
- 72 * 8 = 576 (too large)
- 72 + 8 = 80
- 72 - 8 = 64
- 64 / 8 = 8
- 64 / 17 (not an integer)
- 64 * 17 (too large)
- 64 + 17 = 81
- 64 - 17 = 47
- 17 * 8 = 136 (too large)
- 17 + 8 = 25
- 17 - 8 = 9

Let's try to get close to 90.
If I use 72 and 17, their sum is 89. This is very close to 90.
So, maybe something like (72 + 17) + (something with 8 and 64) = 90.
(72 + 17) = 89.
I need (something with 8 and 64) to equal 1.
Can I get 1 from 8 and 64 using one operation?
8 / 64 = 1/8 (not 1)
64 / 8 = 8 (not 1)
8 * 64 (too large)
8 + 64 (too large)
64 - 8 = 56 (not 1)
8 - 64 (negative)

This path (72 + 17) doesn't seem to work directly.

Let's try another combination that gets close to 90.
Maybe multiplication is involved to get a larger number and then subtract.
Or division to reduce a large number.

Consider 72 and 8. 72 / 8 = 9.
Now I have 9, 64, 17. Target is 90.
Can I combine 9, 64, 17 to get 90?
Possible combinations:
- 9 * 17 = 153. Then I have 153 and 64. 153 - 64 = 89. Close, but not 90.
- 9 * 64 (too large)
- 9 + 64 = 73. Then I have 73 and 17. 73 + 17 = 90. This works!
So, the numbers used are (72/8), 64, and 17.
The equation would be (72 / 8) + 64 + 17.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 72, 8, 64, 17. Yes.
Let's check the operations: /, +, +. Yes, only fundamental operations.
Let's check the result: (72 / 8) + 64 + 17 = 9 + 64 + 17 = 73 + 17 = 90.

This looks like a valid solution. Let's double-check for other possibilities just to be thorough.

What if I started with 64 and 8? 64 / 8 = 8.
Now I have 8, 72, 17. Target is 90.
Can I combine 8, 72, 17 to get 90?
- 8 * 17 = 136. Then I have 136 and 72. 136 - 72 = 64 (not 90). 72 - 136 (negative).

- 8 * 72 (too large)
- 72 + 17 = 89. Then I have 89 and 8. 89 + 8 = 97 (not 90). 89 - 8 = 81 (not 90).

Let's try multiplication first.
72 * 17 (too large)
72 * 8 (too large)
72 * 64 (too large)
8 * 17 = 136. Numbers left: 72, 64. Target 90.
Can I get 90 from 136, 72, 64?
136 - 72 = 64. Then I have 64 and 64. 64 + 64 = 128. 64 - 64 = 0. 64 / 64 = 1.
136 - 64 = 72. Then I have 72 and 72. 72 + 72 = 144. 72 - 72 = 0. 72 / 72 = 1.

Let's consider division of larger numbers by smaller numbers.
72 / 17 (not integer)
72 / 64 (not integer)
64 / 17 (not integer)

What about subtraction to get a smaller number to multiply?
72 - 17 = 55. Numbers left: 8, 64. Target 90.
Can I get 90 from 55, 8, 64?
55 + 8 = 63. Then 63 and 64. 63 + 64 = 127. 64 - 63 = 1.
55 + 64 = 119. Then 119 and 8. 119 - 8 = 111.
55 * 8 = 440 (too large)
55 * 64 (too large)

72 - 64 = 8. Numbers left: 8, 17. Target 90.
Can I get 90 from 8, 8, 17?
8 + 8 = 16. Then 16 and 17. 16 + 17 = 33. 17 - 16 = 1.
8 * 8 = 64. Then 64 and 17. 64 + 17 = 81. 64 - 17 = 47.
8 / 8 = 1. Then 1 and 17. 1 + 17 = 18. 17 - 1 = 16.

Let's revisit the successful path: (72 / 8) + 64 + 17 = 90.
This uses 72, 8, 64, 17 exactly once.
It uses division and addition.
The order of operations is clear: division first, then additions from left to right.

Let's try to write it in a different order to see if it's still valid.
64 + 17 + (72 / 8) = 81 + 9 = 90. Valid.
17 + 64 + (72 / 8) = 81 + 9 = 90. Valid.

What if the division is not the first operation?
Example: 72 + (64 / 8) + 17 = 72 + 8 + 17 = 80 + 17 = 97. (Incorrect)
Example: 72 + 64 + (17 / 8) (not integer)

What if subtraction is involved?
Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 90 and subtract.
Maybe 17 * 8 = 136. Numbers left: 72, 64. Target 90.

3882,1318,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 93, 13, 80, and 92 exactly once, with only +, -, *, / operations, to equal 67.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Try starting with the largest numbers:
    *   93 - 13 = 80. Then we have 80 and 92 left. 80 + 92 = 172 (too big). 92 - 80 = 12 (too small). 80 * 92 (way too big). 80 / 92 (fraction).
    *   93 + 13 = 106. Then we have 80 and 92 left. 106 - 80 = 26. 26 + 92 = 118. 106 - 92 = 14. 14 + 80 = 94.
    *   93 * 13 (too big).
    *   93 / 13 (fraction).

2.  Try other pairings:
    *   80 + 92 = 172. Left: 93, 13. 172 - 93 = 79. 79 - 13 = 66 (close!). 172 - 13 = 159. 159 - 93 = 66 (close again!).
    *   80 - 92 (negative).
    *   80 * 92 (too big).
    *   80 / 92 (fraction).

3.  Let's revisit the 66 result. We got 66 from (80 + 92) - 93 - 13 or (80 + 92) - 13 - 93. We need 67.
    *   Maybe we can adjust one of the subtractions.
    *   What if we do (80 + 92) - (93 - 13)?
        *   80 + 92 = 172

    *   What if we do (80 + 92) - (93 / 13)? (fraction)
    *   What if we do (80 + 92) - (13 * 93)? (too big)

4.  Let's try a different structure. Maybe multiplication is involved to reduce numbers.
    *   (93 - 80) * ?
        *   93 - 80 = 13. Left: 13, 92.
        *   13 * 13 = 169. 169 + 92 (too big). 169 - 92 = 77 (close!).

        *   67 * 93 (too big).
        *   67 / 93 (fraction).

5.  Let's try division first.
    *   92 / 13 (fraction).
    *   93 / 13 (fraction).
    *   80 / 13 (fraction).
    *   92 / 80 (fraction).
    *   93 / 80 (fraction).
    *   13 / 80 (fraction).

6.  Let's try combining numbers to get something that can be multiplied or divided.
    *   We need to get to 67.
    *   Consider 93. 93 - ? = 67. ? = 26. Can we make 26 from 13, 80, 92?
        *   80 - 92 (negative).
        *   92 - 80 = 12. 12 + 13 = 25 (close!). 12 * 13 (too big).
        *   80 + 13 = 93. 93 - 92 = 1 (not 26).
        *   92 + 13 = 105. 105 - 80 = 25 (close!).
    *   Consider 80. 80 - ? = 67. ? = 13. We have 13. Left: 93, 92.
        *   So, 80 - 13 = 67. We need to use 93 and 92.
        *   Can we make 0 from 93 and 92? No, not with basic ops.
        *   Can we make 67 using 93 and 92 and then subtract 13?
            *   93 - 92 = 1. 1 + 13 = 14.
            *   93 + 92 = 185. 185 - 13 = 172.
    *   Consider 92. 92 - ? = 67. ? = 25. Can we make 25 from 93, 13, 80?
        *   93 - 80 = 13. 13 + 13 = 26 (close!).
        *   80 - 13 = 67. 67 - 93 (negative).
        *   93 - 13 = 80. 80 - 80 = 0 (not 25).
        *   80 + 13 = 93. 93 - 93 = 0 (not 25).
        *   93 + 80 = 173. 173 - 13 (too big).

7.  Let's try multiplication to get closer to 67.
    *   (93 / 13) * ? (fraction)
    *   (80 / 13) * ? (fraction)
    *   (92 / 13) * ? (fraction)
    *   (93 / 80) * ? (fraction)
    *   (92 / 80) * ? (fraction)
    *   (13 / 80) * ? (fraction)

8.  Let's try combining numbers to get a factor of something.
    *   We need 67. 67 is prime. This suggests it's unlikely to be the result of a multiplication like A * B = 67 unless one of A or B is 1 or 67.
    *   If A=1, then B=67. Can we make 1 from some numbers and 67 from others?
        *   Make 1: 93 - 92 = 1. Left: 13, 80. Can we make 67 from 13, 80? 80 - 13 = 67.
        *   So, (93 - 92) * (80 - 13) = 1 * 67 = 67.
        *   Let's check: uses 93, 92, 80, 13 exactly once. Uses only +, -, *, /. Result is 67. This works!

Let's verify the equation: (93 - 92) * (80 - 13)
*   93 - 92 = 1
*   80 - 13 = 67
*   1 * 67 = 67

This equation meets all the criteria.

The problem asks me to find a single arithmetic equation using the numbers 52, 2, and 34 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the target value of 35.

Let the numbers be $n_1 = 52$, $n_2 = 2$, and $n_3 = 34$.
The allowed operations are +, -, *, /.
Each number must be used exactly once.
The target value is 35.

I need to explore different combinations of numbers and operations. The order of operations matters, so I should consider parentheses as well, although the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention them. However, to achieve specific results, parentheses are often necessary. Let's assume standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) and explore possibilities.

Let's list the numbers: 52, 2, 34.
Target: 35.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try permutations of the numbers (52, 2, 34) and operations.

**Attempt 1: Start with 52**

*   **Case 1.1: 52 + ...**
    *   52 + 2 + 34 = 88 (Too high)

    *   52 + 34 + 2 = 88 (Same as above)
    *   52 + 34 - 2 = 84 (Too high)
    *   52 + 34 * 2 = 52 + 68 = 120 (Too high)
    *   52 + 34 / 2 = 52 + 17 = 69 (Too high)

*   **Case 1.2: 52 - ...**
    *   52 - 2 + 34 = 50 + 34 = 84 (Too high)
    *   52 - 2 - 34 = 50 - 34 = 16 (Too low)
    *   52 - 2 * 34 = 52 - 68 = -16 (Too low)
    *   52 - 2 / 34 = 52 - 1/17 (Not an integer)
    *   52 - 34 + 2 = 18 + 2 = 20 (Too low)
    *   52 - 34 - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16 (Too low)
    *   52 - 34 * 2 = 52 - 68 = -16 (Too low)
    *   52 - 34 / 2 = 52 - 17 = 35. **This looks promising!**
        *   Let's check: 52 - (34 / 2) = 52 - 17 = 35.
        *   Numbers used: 52, 34, 2. All used exactly once.
        *   Operations used: -, /. Allowed.
        *   Target value: 35. Achieved.
        *   This equation is 52 - 34 / 2 = 35.

Let's continue exploring to be thorough and ensure this is the only or best solution, and to practice the process.

4627,1531,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 61, 48, and 61, each once, to reach the target number 49. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try some combinations:
1.  Start with the larger numbers:
    *   61 + 61 = 122. 122 - 48 = 74 (too high)
    *   61 - 61 = 0. 0 + 48 = 48 (close, but not 49)
    *   61 * 61 = 3721 (way too high)
    *   61 / 61 = 1. 1 + 48 = 49 (This works!)

Let's verify this:
(61 / 61) + 48 = 1 + 48 = 49.
This uses each number (61, 61, 48) exactly once and results in 49.

Another possibility:
*   61 + 48 = 109. 109 - 61 = 48 (close, but not 49)

The user wants an equation using the numbers [30, 77, 33, 27] exactly once, with the goal of reaching 47. I can only use +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 30, 77, 33, 27
Target: 47

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
77 and 33.
77 + 33 = 110
77 - 33 = 44
77 * 33 = 2541
77 / 33 = 2.33... (not an integer, likely not useful unless it cancels out later)

Let's try 77 - 33 = 44.
Now I have 44, 30, 27. Target is 47.
Can I get 3 from 30 and 27?
30 - 27 = 3.
So, (77 - 33) + (30 - 27) = 44 + 3 = 47.
This looks promising!
Let's check the constraints:
Numbers used: 77, 33, 30, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +, -. All basic arithmetic operations.
Target reached: 47.

This seems like a valid solution. Let's double-check.
(77 - 33) + (30 - 27)
= 44 + 3
= 47.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or to explore alternatives.

Possibility 2: Try multiplication early.
30 * 27 = 810 (too large)
30 * 33 = 990 (too large)
30 * 77 = 2310 (too large)
27 * 33 = 891 (too large)
27 * 77 = 2079 (too large)
33 * 77 = 2541 (too large)

Multiplication of two numbers seems to lead to very large numbers, so it's unlikely to be the first operation unless followed by significant division or subtraction.

Possibility 3: Division.
77 / 33 = 2.33...
77 / 27 = 2.85...
33 / 30 = 1.1
33 / 27 = 1.22...
30 / 27 = 1.11...
30 / 33 = 0.90...
27 / 30 = 0.9
27 / 33 = 0.81...

Division of two numbers from the set doesn't yield integers, which makes it harder to work with unless it's part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's reconsider the first successful attempt: (77 - 33) + (30 - 27) = 47.
This uses all numbers and only allowed operations.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe something like (A * B) - C + D or A + (B / C) * D.

Let's try to get close to 47 with two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
30 + 27 = 57. Need to subtract 10. Can I get 10 from 77 and 33?
77 - 33 = 44 (no)
77 + 33 = 110 (no)
77 * 33 (no)
77 / 33 (no)
33 - 77 (no)

30 + 33 = 63. Need to subtract 16. Can I get 16 from 77 and 27?
77 - 27 = 50 (no)
77 + 27 = 104 (no)

30 + 77 = 107. Need to subtract 60. Can I get 60 from 33 and 27?
33 + 27 = 60.
So, (30 + 77) - (33 + 27) = 107 - 60 = 47.
Let's check constraints:
Numbers used: 30, 77, 33, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations used: +, -, +. All basic arithmetic operations.
Target reached: 47.

This is another valid solution: (30 + 77) - (33 + 27) = 47.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe something like A - (B + C - D).
Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 47 and subtract.
77 - 30 = 47. This uses two numbers. I have 33 and 27 left.
Can I make 0 from 33 and 27? No, not with basic operations and using them once.

Let's try to get a number slightly smaller than 47 and add.
30 + 27 = 57. Too big.
30 + 33 = 63. Too big.
30 + 77 = 107. Too big.
27 + 33 = 60. Too big.
27 + 77 = 104. Too big.
33 + 77 = 110. Too big.

Let's try subtraction to get smaller numbers.
77 - 33 = 44. Need to add 3. Can I get 3 from 30 and 27? Yes, 30 - 27 = 3.
So, (77 - 33) + (30 - 27) = 44 + 3 = 47. (Already found this one)

77 - 30 = 47. Need to add 0 from 33 and 27. Not possible.
77 - 27 = 50. Need to subtract 3. Can I get 3 from 30 and 33?
33 - 30 = 3.
So, (77 - 27) - (33 - 30) = 50 - 3 = 47.
Let's check constraints:
Numbers used: 77, 27, 33, 30. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -, -. All basic arithmetic operations.
Target reached: 47.

This is a third valid solution: (77 - 27) - (33 - 30) = 47.

Let's try multiplication with one number and then adjust.
30 * 1 = 30. Need 17 from 77, 33, 27.
77 - 33 - 27 = 44 - 27 = 17.
So, 30 + (77 - 33 - 27) = 30 + 17 = 47.
Let's check constraints:
Numbers used: 30, 77, 33, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations used: +, -, -. All basic arithmetic operations.
Target reached: 47.

This is a fourth valid solution: 30 + (77 - 33 - 27) = 47.

Let's try another one.
Maybe something like (A + B) / C + D. Division is tricky.
Let's try to make a number divisible by one of the remaining numbers.
If I use 30 and 77, I get 107. Not easily divisible by 33 or 27.
If I use 30 and 33, I get 63. Divisible by 27? No.
If I use 30 and 27, I get 57. Divisible by 33? No.
If I use 77 and 33, I get 110. Divisible by 30? No. Divisible by 27? No.
If I use 77 and 27, I get 104. Divisible by 30? No. Divisible by 33? No.
If I use 33 and 27, I get 60. Divisible by 30? Yes, 60 / 30 = 2.
So, (33 + 27) / 30 = 60 / 30 = 2.

The user wants me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers 25, 20, and 41, each exactly once, with the basic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value of 46.

I need to explore different combinations and orders of operations.

Let's list the numbers: 25, 20, 41.
Target: 46.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then incorporating the third.

Possibility 1: Start with 25 and 20.
- 25 + 20 = 45. Need to get 46 from 45 and 41.
  - 45 + 41 = 86 (too high)
  - 45 - 41 = 4 (too low)
  - 41 - 45 = -4 (too low)
  - 45 * 41 (too high)
  - 45 / 41 (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 46)
  - 41 / 45 (not an integer)
- 25 - 20 = 5. Need to get 46 from 5 and 41.
  - 5 + 41 = 46. This looks promising! The expression would be (25 - 20) + 41. Let's check if all numbers are used once: 25, 20, 41. Yes. Operations: -, +. Yes. Target: 46. Yes.
- 20 - 25 = -5. Need to get 46 from -5 and 41.
  - -5 + 41 = 36 (too low)
  - 41 - (-5) = 46. This also works! The expression would be 41 - (20 - 25). Let's check: 41 - (-5) = 41 + 5 = 46. Numbers used: 41, 20, 25. Yes. Operations: -, -. Yes. Target: 46. Yes.
- 25 * 20 = 500 (too high)
- 25 / 20 (not an integer)
- 20 / 25 (not an integer)

Possibility 2: Start with 25 and 41.
- 25 + 41 = 66. Need to get 46 from 66 and 20.
  - 66 - 20 = 46. This works! The expression would be (25 + 41) - 20. Numbers used: 25, 41, 20. Yes. Operations: +, -. Yes. Target: 46. Yes.
- 41 - 25 = 16. Need to get 46 from 16 and 20.
  - 16 + 20 = 36 (too low)
  - 20 + 16 = 36 (too low)
  - 20 - 16 = 4 (too low)
  - 16 - 20 = -4 (too low)
  - 16 * 20 (too high)
  - 16 / 20 (not integer)
  - 20 / 16 (not integer)
- 25 - 41 = -16. Need to get 46 from -16 and 20.
  - -16 + 20 = 4 (too low)
  - 20 - (-16) = 36 (too low)
- 25 * 41 (too high)
- 25 / 41 (not integer)
- 41 / 25 (not integer)

Possibility 3: Start with 20 and 41.
- 20 + 41 = 61. Need to get 46 from 61 and 25.
  - 61 - 25 = 36 (too low)
  - 25 - 61 = -36 (too low)
- 41 - 20 = 21. Need to get 46 from 21 and 25.
  - 21 + 25 = 46. This works! The expression would be (41 - 20) + 25. Numbers used: 41, 20, 25. Yes. Operations: -, +. Yes. Target: 46. Yes.
- 20 - 41 = -21. Need to get 46 from -21 and 25.
  - -21 + 25 = 4 (too low)
  - 25 - (-21) = 46. This works! The expression would be 25 - (20 - 41). Numbers used: 25, 20, 41. Yes. Operations: -, -. Yes. Target: 46. Yes.
- 20 * 41 (too high)
- 20 / 41 (not integer)
- 41 / 20 (not integer)

I have found several valid solutions:
1. (25 - 20) + 41 = 5 + 41 = 46
2. 41 - (20 - 25) = 41 - (-5) = 46
3. (25 + 41) - 20 = 66 - 20 = 46
4. (41 - 20) + 25 = 21 + 25 = 46
5. 25 - (20 - 41) = 25 - (-21) = 46

The simplest one to write out is likely (25 + 41) - 20 or (41 - 20) + 25 or (25 - 20) + 41. I will pick one of these.
Let's choose (25 + 41) - 20.
Check again:
Numbers: 25, 41, 20. Used once.
Operations: +, -. Basic operations.
Target: 46.
(25 + 41) - 20 = 66 - 20 = 46. Correct.

Another option: (41 - 20) + 25
Check again:
Numbers: 41, 20, 25. Used once.
Operations: -, +. Basic operations.
Target: 46.
(41 - 20) + 25 = 21 + 25 = 46. Correct.

Another option: (25 - 20) + 41
Check again:
Numbers: 25, 20, 41. Used once.
Operations: -, +. Basic operations.
Target: 46.
(25 - 20) + 41 = 5 + 41 = 46. Correct.

I will present (25 + 41) - 20 as the solution.

The problem requires me to find a mathematical expression that evaluates to 44, using the numbers 68, 39, and 73 exactly once, and only using the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: {68, 39, 73}.
Target value: 44.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

I need to explore different combinations of these numbers and operations. Since there are three numbers, there will be two operations. The order of operations matters, so I should consider parentheses as well.

Let's try some initial combinations without parentheses first, then consider parentheses.

Possible arrangements of numbers:
1. 68, 39, 73
2. 68, 73, 39
3. 39, 68, 73
4. 39, 73, 68
5. 73, 68, 39
6. 73, 39, 68

Let's try applying operations in sequence.

Case 1: 68, 39, 73
- 68 + 39 + 73 = 107 + 73 = 180 (Too high)
- 68 + 39 - 73 = 107 - 73 = 34 (Close, but not 44)
- 68 - 39 + 73 = 29 + 73 = 102 (Too high)
- 68 - 39 - 73 = 29 - 73 = -44 (Close, but negative)
- 68 * 39 + 73 = 2652 + 73 = 2725 (Too high)
- 68 * 39 - 73 = 2652 - 73 = 2579 (Too high)
- 68 / 39 ... this will result in a fraction, likely not leading to an integer 44 easily. Let's avoid division for now unless it's a clear integer division. 68 is not divisible by 39.

Let's consider parentheses.
Possible structures:
(a op b) op c
a op (b op c)

Let's go back to Case 1: 68, 39, 73
Structure: (a op b) op c
- (68 + 39) + 73 = 107 + 73 = 180
- (68 + 39) - 73 = 107 - 73 = 34
- (68 - 39) + 73 = 29 + 73 = 102
- (68 - 39) - 73 = 29 - 73 = -44
- (68 * 39) + 73 = 2652 + 73 = 2725
- (68 * 39) - 73 = 2652 - 73 = 2579
- (68 / 39) ... not useful.

Structure: a op (b op c)
- 68 + (39 + 73) = 68 + 112 = 180
- 68 + (39 - 73) = 68 + (-34) = 34
- 68 - (39 + 73) = 68 - 112 = -44
- 68 - (39 - 73) = 68 - (-34) = 68 + 34 = 102
- 68 * (39 + 73) = 68 * 112 = 7616
- 68 * (39 - 73) = 68 * (-34) = -2312
- 68 / (39 + 73) = 68 / 112 (fraction)
- 68 / (39 - 73) = 68 / (-34) = -2 (Close, but negative and not 44)

Let's try other number arrangements.

Case 2: 68, 73, 39
- 68 + 73 + 39 = 141 + 39 = 180
- 68 + 73 - 39 = 141 - 39 = 102
- 68 - 73 + 39 = -5 + 39 = 34 (Close)
- 68 - 73 - 39 = -5 - 39 = -44 (Close, negative)
- 68 * 73 + 39 = 4964 + 39 = 5003
- 68 * 73 - 39 = 4964 - 39 = 4925
- 68 / 73 ... fraction.

Parentheses for 68, 73, 39:

- (68 - 73) - 39 = -5 - 39 = -44
- (68 * 73) + 39 = 4964 + 39 = 5003
- (68 * 73) - 39 = 4964 - 39 = 4925

- 68 * (73 + 39) = 68 * 112 = 7616
- 68 * (73 - 39) = 68 * 34 = 2312
- 68 / (73 + 39) = 68 / 112 (fraction)
- 68 / (73 - 39) = 68 / 34 = 2 (Close, but not 44)

Let's try Case 3: 39, 68, 73
- 39 + 68 + 73 = 107 + 73 = 180
- 39 + 68 - 73 = 107 - 73 = 34 (Close)
- 39 - 68 + 73 = -29 + 73 = 44 (Found it!)

Let's verify this: 39 - 68 + 73
Order of operations: subtraction first, then addition.
39 - 68 = -29
-29 + 73 = 44

This uses all numbers (39, 68, 73) exactly once.
It uses only subtraction and addition.
The result is 44.

Let's double check if parentheses are needed or if the standard order of operations is sufficient.
39 - 68 + 73
According to standard order of operations (left to right for addition and subtraction), this is evaluated as (39 - 68) + 73.
39 - 68 = -29
-29 + 73 = 44.
So, no parentheses are strictly necessary for this specific expression to evaluate correctly.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough.

Case 4: 39, 73, 68
- 39 + 73 + 68 = 112 + 68 = 180

        *   So, 68 - (12 + 6) = 68 - 18 = 50. This uses 68, 12, and 6. I still have 1.
        *   How can I incorporate the 1?
            *   (68 - (12 + 6)) * 1 = 50 * 1 = 50. This works!
            *   (68 - (12 + 6)) / 1 = 50 / 1 = 50. This also works.
            *   68 - (12 + 6 + 1) = 68 - 19 = 49 (no)
            *   68 - (12 + 6 - 1) = 68 - 17 = 51 (no)
            *   68 - (12 * 1 + 6) = 68 - 18 = 50. This works.
            *   68 - (12 / 1 + 6) = 68 - 18 = 50. This works.
            *   68 - (12 + 6 * 1) = 68 - 18 = 50. This works.
            *   68 - (12 + 6 / 1) = 68 - 18 = 50. This works.

    Let's pick one of the simpler ones that clearly uses all numbers.
    (68 - (12 + 6)) * 1 = 50. This uses 68, 12, 6, and 1.

2.  **Another approach:**
    *   Try multiplication first. 12 * 6 = 72.
        *   72 - ? = 50. ? = 22. Can I make 22 from 68 and 1? No.
    *   Try 68 / 1 = 68.
        *   68 - ? = 50. ? = 18. Can I make 18 from 12 and 6? Yes, 12 + 6.
        *   So, (68 / 1) - (12 + 6) = 68 - 18 = 50. This works.

3.  **Let's try another structure:**
    *   (68 + 12) = 80.
        *   80 - ? = 50. ? = 30. Can I make 30 from 6 and 1? No.
    *   (68 - 12) = 56.
        *   56 - ? = 50. ? = 6. I have 6 and 1 left.
        *   56 - 6 = 50. I have 1 left. How to use it?
        *   (68 - 12) - 6 * 1 = 56 - 6 = 50. This works.
        *   (68 - 12) - (6 / 1) = 56 - 6 = 50. This works.

4.  **Consider division involving 68:**
    *   68 / 12 is not an integer.
    *   68 / 6 is not an integer.

5.  **Consider division involving 12:**
    *   12 / 6 = 2.
        *   Now I have 1, 68, 2. Target 50.
        *   68 - ? = 50. ? = 18. Can I make 18 from 1 and 2? No.
        *   68 + 1 = 69. 69 - 2 = 67 (no)
        *   68 - 1 = 67. 67 - 2 = 65 (no)
        *   68 * 1 = 68. 68 - 2 = 66 (no)
        *   68 / 1 = 68. 68 - 2 = 66 (no)

6.  **Consider division involving 6:**
    *   6 / 1 = 6.
        *   Now I have 68, 12, 6. Target 50.
        *   This is the same as the original problem, just 6 is derived from 6/1.
        *   68 - (12 + 6) = 50. So, 68 - (12 + (6/1)) = 50. This works.

Let's go back to the first successful one: (68 - (12 + 6)) * 1 = 50.
This is a valid solution.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 68, 12, 6, 1. All used once.
Operations: -, +, *. Allowed.
Result: (68 - (18)) * 1 = 50 * 1 = 50. Correct.

Another one: (68 - 12) - (6 * 1) = 50
Verify:
Numbers used: 68, 12, 6, 1. All used once.
Operations: -, -, *. Allowed.
Result: (56) - (6) = 50. Correct.

I will choose one of these. The first one is slightly more straightforward in terms of grouping.
(68 - (12 + 6)) * 1

Let's try to find one without multiplication by 1 if possible, though it's perfectly valid.
(68 / 1) - (12 + 6) = 50. This is also good.

How about (68 - 12) - 6 = 50? This uses 68, 12, 6. I have 1 left.
(68 - 12) - 6 + 1 = 51 (no)
(68 - 12) - 6 - 1 = 49 (no)
(68 - 12) - (6 * 1) = 50. This works.

Let's try to use division more prominently.
(68 + 12) / ? = 50. 80 / ? = 50. No integer.
(68 - 12) / ? = 50. 56 / ? = 50. No integer.
(68 + 6) / ? = 50. 74 / ? = 50. No integer.
(68 - 6) / ? = 50. 62 / ? = 50. No integer.
(12 + 6) / ? = 50. 18 / ? = 50. No integer.
(12 - 6) / ? = 50. 6 / ? = 50. No integer.

What if 50 is an intermediate result?
Let's try to make 50 from a subset first.
12 * 6 = 72.
68 - 12 = 56.
68 - 6 = 62.
68 - 1 = 67.
12 + 6 = 18.
12 + 1 = 13.
6 + 1 = 7.

Let's try to get close to 50 with two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
68 - 12 = 56. Need to subtract 6. I have 6 and 1.
56 - 6 = 50. Use 1. (68 - 12) - 6 * 1 = 50.

68 - 6 = 62. Need to subtract 12. I have 12 and 1.
62 - 12 = 50. Use 1. (68 - 6) - 12 * 1 = 50.

68 - 1 = 67. Need to subtract 17. I have 12 and 6. 12 + 6 = 18.",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4527,284,"<think>The goal is to reach the value 87 using the numbers 70, 37, and 54 exactly once, with only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: N = {70, 37, 54}.
We need to combine these three numbers using the four operations. There are 3! = 6 permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation has 4 choices. This gives 4^3 = 64 possible combinations of operations for each permutation. However, the order of operations matters (parentheses).

Let's try some combinations systematically.

**Permutation 1: 70, 37, 54**

*   **Attempt 1.1:** (70 + 37) + 54 = 107 + 54 = 161 (Too high)
*   **Attempt 1.2:** (70 + 37) - 54 = 107 - 54 = 53 (Too low)
*   **Attempt 1.3:** (70 - 37) + 54 = 33 + 54 = 87. This looks promising!
    *   Numbers used: 70, 37, 54 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: -, + (allowed).
    *   Evaluation: (70 - 37) + 54 = 33 + 54 = 87.
    *   This seems to be a valid solution. Let's double-check the requirements.
        *   Numbers: 70, 37, 54 - used exactly once. Yes.
        *   Operations: +, -, *, / - only +, - used. Yes.
        *   Result: 87. Yes.

Let's explore other permutations just to be thorough and ensure this is the most straightforward or to see if there are alternatives.

**Permutation 2: 70, 54, 37**

*   **Attempt 2.1:** (70 + 54) + 37 = 124 + 37 = 161
*   **Attempt 2.2:** (70 + 54) - 37 = 124 - 37 = 87. Another potential solution!
    *   Numbers used: 70, 54, 37 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: +, - (allowed).
    *   Evaluation: (70 + 54) - 37 = 124 - 37 = 87.
    *   This is also a valid solution.

**Permutation 3: 37, 70, 54**

*   **Attempt 3.1:** (37 + 70) + 54 = 107 + 54 = 161
*   **Attempt 3.2:** (37 + 70) - 54 = 107 - 54 = 53
*   **Attempt 3.3:** (37 - 70) + 54 = -33 + 54 = 21
*   **Attempt 3.4:** (70 - 37) + 54 = 33 + 54 = 87. (This is the same as Attempt 1.3, just reordered the first two numbers in the expression).

**Permutation 4: 37, 54, 70**

*   **Attempt 4.1:** (37 + 54) + 70 = 91 + 70 = 161
*   **Attempt 4.2:** (37 + 54) - 70 = 91 - 70 = 21
*   **Attempt 4.3:** (54 - 37) + 70 = 17 + 70 = 87. Another potential solution!
    *   Numbers used: 54, 37, 70 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: -, + (allowed).
    *   Evaluation: (54 - 37) + 70 = 17 + 70 = 87.

**Permutation 5: 54, 37, 70**

*   **Attempt 5.2:** (54 + 37) - 70 = 91 - 70 = 21
*   **Attempt 5.3:** (54 - 37) + 70 = 17 + 70 = 87. (Same as Attempt 4.3).

**Permutation 6: 54, 70, 37**

*   **Attempt 6.1:** (54 + 70) + 37 = 124 + 37 = 161
*   **Attempt 6.2:** (54 + 70) - 37 = 124 - 37 = 87. (Same as Attempt 2.2).

Let's consider multiplication and division.

**Using Multiplication:**
If we multiply two numbers, the result will be larger.
*   70 * 37 = 2590 (Too big)
*   70 * 54 = 3780 (Too big)
*   37 * 54 = 1998 (Too big)

This suggests that multiplication is unlikely to be the primary operation unless it's used in a way that significantly reduces the value, perhaps with division.

Let's try division.
*   70 / 37 (not an integer)
*   70 / 54 (not an integer)
*   37 / 70 (not an integer)
*   37 / 54 (not an integer)
*   54 / 70 (not an integer)
*   54 / 37 (not an integer)

Since we are aiming for an integer result (87), and the divisions don't yield integers, it's unlikely that division will be used directly on two of the given numbers unless it's part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's re-examine the successful attempts:
1.  (70 - 37) + 54 = 33 + 54 = 87
2.  (70 + 54) - 37 = 124 - 37 = 87
3.  (54 - 37) + 70 = 17 + 70 = 87

All three are valid. The prompt asks for ""a single mathematical expression"". I will choose the first one found as it's simple and directly meets the criteria.

**Self-check for (70 - 37) + 54:**
*   Numbers used: 70, 37, 54. Exactly once. Yes.
*   Operations used: -, +. Allowed operations. Yes.
*   Evaluation: 70 - 37 = 33. 33 + 54 = 87. Correct.

**Self-check for (70 + 54) - 37:**
*   Numbers used: 70, 54, 37. Exactly once. Yes.
*   Operations used: +, -. Allowed operations. Yes.
*   Evaluation: 70 + 54 = 124. 124 - 37 = 87. Correct.

**Self-check for (54 - 37) + 70:**

*   Operations used: -, +. Allowed operations. Yes.
*   Evaluation: 54 - 37 = 17. 17 + 70 = 87. Correct.

Each number must be used exactly once.

1. (79 + 7) + 6 = 86 + 6 = 92. This works!
2. (79 - 7) + 6 = 72 + 6 = 78. Not 92.
3. (79 * 7) + 6 = 553 + 6 = 559. Too large.
4. (79 / 7) + 6 = Not an integer.
5. (79 + 6) + 7 = 85 + 7 = 92. This also works!
6. (79 - 6) + 7 = 73 + 7 = 80. Not 92.
7. (79 * 6) + 7 = 474 + 7 = 481. Too large.
8. (79 / 6) + 7 = Not an integer.
9. (6 + 7) + 79 = 13 + 79 = 92. This also works!

11. (6 * 7) + 79 = 42 + 79 = 121. Too large.
12. (6 / 7) + 79 = Not an integer.
13. (7 + 6) + 79 = 13 + 79 = 92. Same as 9.
14. (7 - 6) + 79 = 1 + 79 = 80. Not 92.
15. (7 * 6) + 79 = 42 + 79 = 121. Same as 11.
16. (7 / 6) + 79 = Not an integer.

Let's try subtraction as the last operation.
17. (79 + 6) - 7 = 85 - 7 = 78. Not 92.
18. (79 + 7) - 6 = 86 - 6 = 80. Not 92.

23. (7 * 6) - 79 = 42 - 79 = -37. Not 92.

Let's try multiplication as the last operation. This is unlikely to work with these numbers to get 92.
(6+7)*79 = 13*79 = 1027
(79+7)*6 = 86*6 = 516
(79+6)*7 = 85*7 = 595

Let's try division as the last operation. This is also unlikely.

The simplest solutions found are:
(79 + 7) + 6 = 92
(79 + 6) + 7 = 92
(6 + 7) + 79 = 92
(7 + 6) + 79 = 92

Let's list the numbers: 96, 39, 1, 2.
Target: 83.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest number (96) and try to adjust it.
2. Combine smaller numbers first to create intermediate values.
3. Look for combinations that might get close to 83.

Let's try starting with 96.
If I subtract from 96, I need to subtract 96 - 83 = 13. Can I make 13 from 39, 1, and 2?
- 39 - 1 - 2 = 36 (too large)
- 39 / (1+2) = 39 / 3 = 13. This looks promising!
So, the expression would be 96 - (39 / (1 + 2)).
Let's check:

- 96 * 1 = 96. Then I need to get 83 from 96, 39, 2. 96 - (something) = 83. Need to subtract 13. Can I make 13 from 39 and 2? No simple way. 39/2 is not an integer. 39-2 = 37. 39+2 = 41.
- 96 * 2 = 192. Too large.
- 39 * 1 = 39. Need to get 83 from 96, 39, 2. 96 + 39 + 2 = 137. 96 + 39 - 2 = 133. 96 - 39 + 2 = 59. 96 - 39 - 2 = 55.
- 39 * 2 = 78. Need to get 83 from 96, 78, 1. 96 - 78 + 1 = 19. 96 + 78 + 1 = 175. 96 - (78+1) = 96 - 79 = 17.
- 1 * 2 = 2. Need to get 83 from 96, 39, 2. 96 + 39 - 2 = 133. 96 - 39 + 2 = 59.

Let's try division involving 96.
- 96 / 1 = 96. Need 83 from 96, 39, 2. Already checked.
- 96 / 2 = 48. Need 83 from 48, 39, 1.
  - 48 + 39 + 1 = 88. Close.
  - 48 + 39 - 1 = 86. Close.
  - 48 - 39 + 1 = 10.
  - 48 - 39 - 1 = 8.
  - (48 + 39) * 1 = 87.
  - (48 - 39) * 1 = 9.
  - 48 + (39 * 1) = 87.
  - 48 - (39 * 1) = 9.
  - 39 + (48 * 1) = 87.
  - 39 - (48 * 1) = -9.
  - 1 + (48 * 39) = very large.
  - 1 - (48 * 39) = very negative.
  - 48 + 39 + 1 = 88.
  - 48 + 39 - 1 = 86.
  - 48 - 39 + 1 = 10.
  - 48 - 39 - 1 = 8.
  - 39 + 48 + 1 = 88.
  - 39 + 48 - 1 = 86.
  - 39 - 48 + 1 = -8.
  - 39 - 48 - 1 = -10.
  - 1 + 48 + 39 = 88.
  - 1 + 48 - 39 = 10.
  - 1 - 48 + 39 = -8.
  - 1 - 48 - 39 = -86.
  - (96/2) + 39 + 1 = 48 + 39 + 1 = 88.
  - (96/2) + 39 - 1 = 48 + 39 - 1 = 86.
  - 96 / (2 * 1) = 96 / 2 = 48. Need 83 from 48, 39. No.
  - 96 / (2 + 1) = 96 / 3 = 32. Need 83 from 32, 39. 32+39 = 71. 39-32 = 7. 32*39 = large.
  - 96 / (2 - 1) = 96 / 1 = 96. Need 83 from 96, 39. No.

Let's try division involving 39.
- 39 / 1 = 39. Need 83 from 96, 39, 2.
  - 96 - 39 + 2 = 59.
  - 96 + 39 - 2 = 133.
  - 96 - (39+2) = 96 - 41 = 55.
  - 96 - (39-2) = 96 - 37 = 59.
  - 96 + (39/?) No.
- 39 / 2 is not an integer.

Let's try division involving 2.
- 2 / 1 = 2. Need 83 from 96, 39, 2.
  - 96 + 39 - 2 = 133.
  - 96 - 39 + 2 = 59.

Let's revisit the first successful attempt: 96 - (39 / (1 + 2)).
Numbers used: 96, 39, 1, 2. All used once.
Operations used: -, /, +. All allowed.
Calculation:
1 + 2 = 3
39 / 3 = 13
96 - 13 = 83.
The result is exactly 83.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D or (A + B) * C - D.

Consider (39 * 2) + 96 - 1 = 78 + 96 - 1 = 174 - 1 = 173. (Too large)
Consider (39 * 2) - 96 + 1 = 78 - 96 + 1 = -18 + 1 = -17. (Too small)
Consider (96 / 2) + 39 - 1 = 48 + 39 - 1 = 87 - 1 = 86. (Close, but not 83)
Consider (96 / 2) - 39 + 1 = 48 - 39 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. (Too small)

Consider (96 - 39) * 1 + 2 = 57 * 1 + 2 = 57 + 2 = 59. (Too small)
Consider (96 - 39) * 2 + 1 = 57 * 2 + 1 = 114 + 1 = 1",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
5739,332,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 72, 6, and 12, each exactly once, to equal 66. Only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed.

Let's list the numbers: 72, 6, 12.
The target is 66.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. I can try different combinations and orders.

Possible combinations of two numbers first:
1. 72 and 6:
   - 72 + 6 = 78
   - 72 - 6 = 66 (This is promising! If I can use 12 to not change 66, that would be ideal, but I must use it.)
   - 72 * 6 = 432
   - 72 / 6 = 12

2. 72 and 12:
   - 72 + 12 = 84
   - 72 - 12 = 60
   - 72 * 12 = 864
   - 72 / 12 = 6

3. 6 and 12:
   - 6 + 12 = 18
   - 12 - 6 = 6
   - 6 * 12 = 72
   - 12 / 6 = 2

Let's revisit the promising one: 72 - 6 = 66.
Now I have the number 12 left to use. I need to incorporate 12 into the equation (72 - 6) such that the result remains 66.
This means I need to perform an operation with 12 that results in 0, or an operation with 66 that results in 66.

If I have (72 - 6) and I need to use 12:
- (72 - 6) + 12 = 66 + 12 = 78 (Incorrect)
- (72 - 6) - 12 = 66 - 12 = 54 (Incorrect)
- (72 - 6) * 12 = 66 * 12 = 792 (Incorrect)
- (72 - 6) / 12 = 66 / 12 = 5.5 (Incorrect)

This suggests that the 72 - 6 = 66 part might not be the final step.

Let's try other combinations where 66 might be an intermediate result or the final result.

Consider the numbers again: 72, 6, 12. Target: 66.

What if 12 is used with 6 first?
- 12 / 6 = 2. Now I have 72 and 2.
  - 72 + 2 = 74 (Incorrect)
  - 72 - 2 = 70 (Incorrect)
  - 72 * 2 = 144 (Incorrect)
  - 72 / 2 = 36 (Incorrect)

- 12 * 6 = 72. Now I have 72 and 72.
  - 72 + 72 = 144 (Incorrect)
  - 72 - 72 = 0 (Incorrect)
  - 72 * 72 = 5184 (Incorrect)
  - 72 / 72 = 1 (Incorrect)

- 12 + 6 = 18. Now I have 72 and 18.
  - 72 + 18 = 90 (Incorrect)
  - 72 - 18 = 54 (Incorrect)
  - 72 * 18 = 1296 (Incorrect)
  - 72 / 18 = 4 (Incorrect)

- 12 - 6 = 6. Now I have 72 and 6.
  - 72 + 6 = 78 (Incorrect)
  - 72 - 6 = 66 (This is the one we saw before. If the operation is (72 - (12 - 6)), then 72 - 6 = 66. This uses all numbers and operations correctly.)
  - 72 * 6 = 432 (Incorrect)
  - 72 / 6 = 12 (Incorrect)

Let's check the potential solution: 72 - (12 - 6).
Numbers used: 72, 12, 6 (all used once).
Operations used: -, - (basic arithmetic).
Evaluation: 72 - (12 - 6) = 72 - 6 = 66.
This works!

Let's try another path to be sure.
What if 72 is divided by something?
- 72 / 6 = 12. Now I have 12 and 12.
  - 12 + 12 = 24 (Incorrect)
  - 12 - 12 = 0 (Incorrect)
  - 12 * 12 = 144 (Incorrect)
  - 12 / 12 = 1 (Incorrect)

- 72 / 12 = 6. Now I have 6 and 6.
  - 6 + 6 = 12 (Incorrect)
  - 6 - 6 = 0 (Incorrect)
  - 6 * 6 = 36 (Incorrect)
  - 6 / 6 = 1 (Incorrect)

What if 72 is multiplied by something? This will likely result in a large number, so subtraction might be needed.
- 72 * 6 = 432. Now I have 432 and 12.
  - 432 - 12 = 420 (Incorrect)
  - 432 + 12 = 444 (Incorrect)
  - 432 / 12 = 36 (Incorrect)

- 72 * 12 = 864. Now I have 864 and 6.
  - 864 - 6 = 858 (Incorrect)
  - 864 + 6 = 870 (Incorrect)
  - 864 / 6 = 144 (Incorrect)

Let's go back to the 72 - 6 = 66 idea.
We found 72 - (12 - 6) = 66.

Are there other ways to get 66?
Maybe 6 * 12 = 72, and then subtract something involving 72? No, 72 is used.
Maybe 6 * 12 = 72, and then subtract 6? No, 6 is used.

Let's consider the structure of the equation.
We have three numbers.
Possible structures:
(a op b) op c
a op (b op c)

Let's re-examine the 72 - 6 = 66 path.
We need to use 12.
If we have 72 and 6, and we want 66, we can do 72 - 6.
Now we have 12.
How can we combine 12 with 72 and 6 to get 66?

Possibility 1: (72 op 6) op 12 = 66
- (72 - 6) op 12 = 66 op 12
  - 66 + 12 = 78
  - 66 - 12 = 54
  - 66 * 12 = 792
  - 66 / 12 = 5.5

Possibility 2: 72 op (6 op 12) = 66
- 72 op (6 + 12) = 72 op 18
  - 72 + 18 = 90
  - 72 - 18 = 54
  - 72 * 18 = 1296
  - 72 / 18 = 4
- 72 op (12 - 6) = 72 op 6
  - 72 + 6 = 78
  - 72 - 6 = 66 (Found it again: 72 - (12 - 6))
  - 72 * 6 = 432
  - 72 / 6 = 12
- 72 op (6 * 12) = 72 op 72
  - 72 + 72 = 144

The user wants an equation using the numbers 49, 56, 49, and 9 exactly once.
The equation must evaluate to 65.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: [49, 56, 49, 9]
Target value: 65

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to reach 65.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite large, especially the two 49s.
The target 65 is relatively small compared to the numbers. This suggests division or subtraction might be important.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(56 + 49) = 105. Then use 49 and 9. 105 - 49 = 56. 56 + 9 = 65. This works!
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 56, 49, 49, 9. Yes.
Let's check the operations: +, -, +. Yes.
The equation is (56 + 49) - 49 + 9 = 65.

Let's try another approach to confirm or find alternatives.

Possibility 2: Try division.
Can any number be divided by another to get a useful result?
49 / 49 = 1.
If we have 1, we are left with 56 and 9.
So, (49 / 49) = 1. We need to get 64 from 56 and 9.
56 + 9 = 65. Not 64.
56 - 9 = 47. Not 64.
56 * 9 = 504. Not 64.
56 / 9 is not an integer.

Let's try dividing 56 by something.
56 / 49 is not an integer.
56 / 9 is not an integer.

Let's try dividing 49 by something.
49 / 49 = 1 (already tried).
49 / 9 is not an integer.

Possibility 3: Multiplication.
If we multiply, the numbers will get very large quickly.
49 * 9 = 441.
49 * 49 = 2401.
49 * 56 = 2744.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt.
(56 + 49) - 49 + 9 = 65
Numbers used: 56, 49, 49, 9. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, +. Allowed.
Result: 105 - 49 + 9 = 56 + 9 = 65. Correct.

Let's try to rearrange the order of operations or numbers.
What if we did 56 - 49 first?
56 - 49 = 7.
Remaining numbers: 49, 9.
We need to get 65 from 7, 49, 9.
7 + 49 + 9 = 56 + 9 = 65. This also works!
Equation: (56 - 49) + 49 + 9 = 65.
Numbers used: 56, 49, 49, 9. All used once.
Operations used: -, +, +. Allowed.
Result: 7 + 49 + 9 = 56 + 9 = 65. Correct.

Let's try another arrangement.
What if we did 49 + 9 first?
49 + 9 = 58.
Remaining numbers: 49, 56.
We need to get 65 from 58, 49, 56.
This doesn't seem straightforward.

Let's consider the structure of the first solution: (A + B) - C + D = Target.
(56 + 49) - 49 + 9 = 65.

Consider the structure of the second solution: (A - B) + C + D = Target.
(56 - 49) + 49 + 9 = 65.

Let's try a different grouping.
What if we group 49 and 9 together first?
(49 + 9) = 58. Left with 49, 56.
We need to combine 58, 49, 56 to get 65.
58 + 49 = 107. 107 - 56 = 51. Not 65.
58 - 49 = 9. 9 + 56 = 65. This works!
Equation: (49 + 9) - 49 + 56 = 65.
Numbers used: 49, 9, 49, 56. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, +. Allowed.
Result: 58 - 49 + 56 = 9 + 56 = 65. Correct.

Let's try another grouping.
(49 - 9) = 40. Left with 49, 56.
We need to combine 40, 49, 56 to get 65.
40 + 49 = 89. 89 - 56 = 33. Not 65.
40 - 49 = -9. -9 + 56 = 47. Not 65.
40 + 56 = 96. 96 - 49 = 47. Not 65.

Let's try multiplication with one of the numbers.
Maybe 9 is used in multiplication.
If we multiply 9 by something, it will likely be small.
Let's try 9 * (something).
If we do 49 / 49 = 1. Then we have 56 and 9.
(49 / 49) * 9 = 9. Left with 56. 9 + 56 = 65.
Equation: (49 / 49) * 9 + 56 = 65.
Numbers used: 49, 49, 9, 56. All used once.
Operations used: /, *, +. Allowed.
Result: 1 * 9 + 56 = 9 + 56 = 65. Correct.

This is another valid solution. The user asked for *an* equation. I have found several.
(56 + 49) - 49 + 9 = 65
(56 - 49) + 49 + 9 = 65
(49 + 9) - 49 + 56 = 65
(49 / 49) * 9 + 56 = 65

I will pick one of the simpler ones. The first one found seems good.
(56 + 49) - 49 + 9 = 65

Let's double check the constraints:
- Use all numbers from [49 56 49 9] exactly once. (Yes: 56, 49, 49, 9)
- Evaluate to 65. (Yes: 105 - 49 + 9 = 56 + 9 = 65)
- Utilize only the operations +, -, *, /. (Yes: +, -, +)
- Present the final equation within <answer></answer> tags.

The equation (56 + 49) - 49 + 9 = 65 fits all criteria.
Another one: 56 + (49 / 49) * 9 = 65. This is also valid.
56 + 1 * 9 = 56 + 9 = 65.

Let's try to use division in a different way.
Maybe 56 / (something).
56 / 49 is not integer.
56 / 9 is not integer.

What about 49 / 7? But 7 is not available.

Let's consider the structure A + B - C + D.
56 + 49 - 49 + 9 = 65.

Let's consider the structure A - B + C + D.
56 - 49 + 49 + 9 = 7 + 49 + 9 = 56 + 9 = 65.

Let's consider the structure A + B + C - D.
49 + 49 + 9 - 56 = 98 + 9 - 56 = 107 - 56 = 51. No.",0.0,Answer content is empty.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are relatively large, so division might be useful to reduce them.

Possibility 1: Start with a large number and subtract.

What if we use division at the end?
Let's try to get a number that divides nicely into something.
Maybe we can get a number like 34, 51, 68, 85, etc.

Let's try to get 17 directly.
Can we make 17 from two numbers?

Example: (A op B) op (C op D) = 17

Consider 86 / 2 = 43. We have 43.

5531,1130,"<think>The target is 41. The numbers are 60, 10, 14, and 43. I need to use all of them exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's look at the numbers and the target. 41 is a relatively small number compared to 60 and 43. This suggests that subtraction might be a key operation, or perhaps division to reduce larger numbers.

Let's try to combine the larger numbers first.
60 and 43.
60 - 43 = 17. I have 10 and 14 left. Can I get 41 from 17, 10, and 14?
17 + 10 + 14 = 41. This looks promising!
So, the equation could be (60 - 43) + 10 + 14.
Let's check:
(60 - 43) = 17
17 + 10 = 27
27 + 14 = 41.
This uses all numbers (60, 43, 10, 14) exactly once and results in the target 41.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, though the first one seems correct.

What if I start with 60 and 10?
60 / 10 = 6. Numbers left: 14, 43. Target: 41. Can I get 41 from 6, 14, 43?
6 + 14 + 43 = 63 (too high)
43 - 14 - 6 = 23 (too low)
43 + 14 - 6 = 51 (too high)
43 - (14 - 6) = 43 - 8 = 35 (too low)
(43 + 6) - 14 = 49 - 14 = 35 (too low)
(43 - 6) + 14 = 37 + 14 = 51 (too high)

What if I start with 60 and 14?
60 / 14 is not an integer.
60 - 14 = 46. Numbers left: 10, 43. Target: 41. Can I get 41 from 46, 10, 43?
46 - 10 + 43 = 79 (too high)
46 + 10 - 43 = 13 (too low)
43 - (46 - 10) = 43 - 36 = 7 (too low)
(46 - 43) + 10 = 3 + 10 = 13 (too low)

What if I start with 43 and 10?
43 - 10 = 33. Numbers left: 60, 14. Target: 41. Can I get 41 from 33, 60, 14?
60 - 14 - 33 = 13 (too low)
60 + 14 - 33 = 41. This works!
So, the equation could be (60 + 14) - (43 - 10).
Let's check:
(60 + 14) = 74
(43 - 10) = 33
74 - 33 = 41.
This also uses all numbers and reaches the target.

Let's compare the two valid solutions:
1. (60 - 43) + 10 + 14
2. (60 + 14) - (43 - 10)

Both are valid. The first one seems slightly simpler in terms of operations. The problem asks to construct *an* arithmetic equation, so either is fine. I'll present the first one I found.

Let's re-verify the first solution:
Numbers: [60, 10, 14, 43]
Target: 41
Equation: (60 - 43) + 10 + 14
Step 1: 60 - 43 = 17 (uses 60 and 43)
Step 2: 17 + 10 = 27 (uses the result and 10)
Step 3: 27 + 14 = 41 (uses the result and 14)
All numbers are used exactly once. The operations are +, -. The target is reached.

Let's re-verify the second solution:
Numbers: [60, 10, 14, 43]
Target: 41
Equation: (60 + 14) - (43 - 10)
Step 1: 60 + 14 = 74 (uses 60 and 14)
Step 2: 43 - 10 = 33 (uses 43 and 10)
Step 3: 74 - 33 = 41 (uses the results)
All numbers are used exactly once. The operations are +, -. The target is reached.

I will provide the first one as it was found first and is straightforward.

3009,1606,"<think>The target value is 26. The numbers available are 17, 4, 25, and 68. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's look at the numbers and the target.
We have a large number (68) and a number close to the target (25).
We also have 17 and 4.

Possible strategies:
1. Use the large number (68) and subtract from it.
2. Combine smaller numbers to get a value that can be added to or subtracted from 25 or 17.
3. Try to create 26 directly or a number close to it.

Let's try using 68.
If we subtract something from 68 to get 26, we need to subtract 68 - 26 = 42.
Can we make 42 using 17, 4, and 25?
17 + 25 = 42. This uses 17 and 25. We still have 4 left. This doesn't work.
17 * 4 = 68. Not 42.
25 + 17 = 42.
25 - 17 = 8.
25 * 17 = 425.
25 / 17 is not an integer.
17 + 4 = 21.
17 - 4 = 13.
17 * 4 = 68.
17 / 4 is not an integer.
25 + 4 = 29.
25 - 4 = 21.
25 * 4 = 100.
25 / 4 is not an integer.

Let's try combining 17, 4, and 25 to get 42.
(17 + 25) = 42. We have 4 left.
(17 * 4) = 68. We have 25 left.
(25 * 4) = 100. We have 17 left.
(25 + 4) = 29. We have 17 left.
(17 + 4) = 21. We have 25 left.

Let's try another approach. Maybe combine 17 and 4 first.
17 + 4 = 21. Remaining: 25, 68. Target: 26.
Can we get 5 from 25 and 68? 68 / 25 is not integer. 25 / 68 is not integer. 68 - 25 = 43. 68 + 25 = 93.
So, 21 + (something from 25, 68) = 26. We need 5. Not possible.
21 * (something from 25, 68) = 26. Not possible.

17 - 4 = 13. Remaining: 25, 68. Target: 26.
Can we get 13 from 25 and 68? 68 - 25 = 43. 68 + 25 = 93.
So, 13 + (something from 25, 68) = 26. We need 13. Not possible.
13 * (something from 25, 68) = 26. We need 2. Not possible.

17 * 4 = 68. Remaining: 25, 68. Target: 26.
This is problematic as we have 68 twice. This means we cannot use 17*4 as a standalone step if we want to use 68 later.

Let's try combining 25 and 4.
25 + 4 = 29. Remaining: 17, 68. Target: 26.
Can we get -3 from 17 and 68? 17 - 68 = -51. 68 - 17 = 51.
So, 29 + (something from 17, 68) = 26. We need -3. Not possible.
29 - (something from 17, 68) = 26. We need 3. Not possible.

25 - 4 = 21. Remaining: 17, 68. Target: 26.
Can we get 5 from 17 and 68? 68 - 17 = 51. 68 + 17 = 85.
So, 21 + (something from 17, 68) = 26. We need 5. Not possible.

25 * 4 = 100. Remaining: 17, 68. Target: 26.
Can we get -74 from 17 and 68? 17 - 68 = -51. 68 - 17 = 51.
So, 100 + (something from 17, 68) = 26. We need -74. Not possible.
100 - (something from 17, 68) = 26. We need 74. Not possible.

Let's try using 68 and 4.
68 / 4 = 17. Remaining: 17, 25. Target: 26.
We have 17 and 25. We need to get 26.
17 + 25 = 42.
25 - 17 = 8.
17 - 25 = -8.
17 * 25 = 425.
This doesn't seem to lead to 26.

Let's try 68 / 17 = 4. Remaining: 4, 25. Target: 26.
We have 4 and 25. We need to get 26.
4 + 25 = 29. Close.
25 - 4 = 21.
4 - 25 = -21.
4 * 25 = 100.
We have 29. We need 26. We need to subtract 3. We don't have a way to make 3 from the numbers used so far (68/17 and 4, 25).

Let's reconsider 68 / 4 = 17. Remaining: 17, 25. Target: 26.
We have the result 17, and the numbers 17 and 25.
We need to combine the result 17 with 17 and 25 to get 26.
Let's use the result of 68/4 (which is 17) and the number 25.
(68 / 4) + 25 = 17 + 25 = 42. We still have 17 left.
(68 / 4) - 25 = 17 - 25 = -8. We still have 17 left.
25 - (68 / 4) = 25 - 17 = 8. We still have 17 left.

42 - (something from 4, 68) = 26. We need 16. Not possible.

It's unlikely that multiplication or division will be the primary operation to get to 57 from these numbers without resulting in very large or very small numbers, or fractions that are hard to resolve.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 20.
- If I add 3 and 13: 20 + 3 + 13 = 36. Too low.
- If I multiply 3 and 13: 20 + (3 * 13) = 20 + 39 = 59. Too high.
- If I subtract 3 from 13: 20 + (13 - 3) = 20 + 10 = 30. Too low.
- If I subtract 13 from 3: 20 + (3 - 13) = 20 + (-10) = 10. Too low.
- If I multiply 20 by 3: (20 * 3) + 13 = 60 + 13 = 73. Too high.
- If I multiply 20 by 13: (20 * 13) + 3 = 260 + 3 = 263. Too high.
- If I divide 20 by 3: (20 / 3) + 13. This will result in a fraction, which is unlikely to lead to 47 easily.

Let's list the numbers: [69, 52, 13, 24].
The target value is 63.

We need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. There are many possible combinations and orders of operations.

Let's try to get close to 63 using some of the numbers.
69 is close to 63. Maybe we can subtract something from 69.
69 - ? = 63. So, ? = 6.
Can we make 6 from 52, 13, and 24?
52 / 13 = 4.
24 / 4 = 6.
So, we can get 6 from (24 / (52 / 13)).
Let's check if this works: 69 - (24 / (52 / 13)).
Order of operations:
52 / 13 = 4
24 / 4 = 6
69 - 6 = 63.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's verify the constraints:
- Numbers used: 69, 52, 13, 24. All used exactly once.
- Operations used: -, /, /. Basic arithmetic operations.
- Result: 63.

Let's consider other possibilities to ensure this is a reasonable approach.

What if we start with 52?
52 + ? = 63. ? = 11. Can we make 11 from 69, 13, 24?
69 - 24 = 45. 45 / 13 is not an integer.
69 / 13 is not an integer.
24 / 13 is not an integer.
69 + 24 = 93.
69 - 13 = 56.
24 - 13 = 11.
So, we can make 11 from (24 - 13).
Let's try: 52 + (24 - 13).
52 + 11 = 63.
This also works!
Numbers used: 52, 24, 13. We still need to use 69. This combination doesn't use all numbers.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: 69 - (24 / (52 / 13)).
This uses all numbers and evaluates to 63.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe multiplication is involved.
If we multiply two numbers, we get larger numbers.
69 * 52 is very large.
69 * 13 is large.
69 * 24 is large.
52 * 13 is large.
52 * 24 is large.
13 * 24 = 312.

Let's try to get a number close to 63 by multiplying and then adjusting.
Maybe we can get a number slightly larger than 63 and subtract.
Or a number slightly smaller and add.

Consider 24 * 3 = 72. Can we make 3 from 69, 52, 13?
69 / ? = 3. ? = 23. Can we make 23 from 52, 13? 52 - 13 = 39. 52 / 13 = 4. No.
52 / ? = 3. No.
13 / ? = 3. No.

Consider 13 * 5 = 65. Can we make 5 from 69, 52, 24?
69 - 52 = 17.
69 - 24 = 45.
52 - 24 = 28.
69 / ? = 5. No.
52 / ? = 5. No.
24 / ? = 5. No.

Let's try combining numbers to get a result that, when operated with another number, gives 63.
For example, if we have X and Y, and X + Y = 63.
Or X - Y = 63.
Or X * Y = 63. (Factors of 63 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 63. None of our numbers are factors that can be easily combined to make other factors).
Or X / Y = 63.

Let's revisit the first solution: 69 - (24 / (52 / 13)).
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to find another one just to be sure.
What if we use 24 and 13 first?
24 + 13 = 37.
24 - 13 = 11.
24 * 13 = 312.
24 / 13 (not integer).

If we have 37, we need to get 63 from 69 and 52.
69 - 52 = 17. 37 + 17 = 54. Not 63.
69 + 52 = 121.
52 - 69 = -17.

If we have 11, we need to get 63 from 69 and 52.
69 - 52 = 17. 11 + 17 = 28. Not 63.
69 + 52 = 121.
52 - 69 = -17.

Let's try combining 69 and 13.
69 + 13 = 82.
69 - 13 = 56.
69 * 13 = 897.
69 / 13 (not integer).

If we have 82, we need to get 63 from 52 and 24.
52 + 24 = 76. 82 - 76 = 6. Not 63.
52 - 24 = 28. 82 - 28 = 54. Not 63.
24 - 52 = -28. 82 - (-28) = 110.

If we have 56, we need to get 63 from 52 and 24.
52 + 24 = 76. 56 + 76 = 132. 56 - 76 = -20. 76 - 56 = 20.
52 - 24 = 28. 56 + 28 = 84. 56 - 28 = 28. 28 - 56 = -28.
24 - 52 = -28. 56 + (-28) = 28. 56 - (-28) = 84.

Let's try combining 52 and 13.
52 + 13 = 65.
52 - 13 = 39.

    *   54 is an even number.
    *   Factors of 54: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.

Let's try some combinations:

2.  **Start with 44:**

        This uses 44, 54, and 27 exactly once.

            So, 27 - (combination of 54, 44) doesn't seem to work.

        *   ? - 27 = 42. ? = 69. Can I make 69 from 54 and 44?

2718,1022,"<think>The target number is 88.
The available numbers are [81, 69, 76].
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 81.
81 + ? = 88. This requires 7. Can we make 7 from 69 and 76?
76 - 69 = 7.
So, 81 + (76 - 69) = 81 + 7 = 88.
This uses all numbers [81, 76, 69] exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's verify:
81 + (76 - 69)
81 + 7
88

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure or to explore if there are multiple solutions.

Possibility 2: Start with 76.
76 + ? = 88. This requires 12. Can we make 12 from 81 and 69?
81 - 69 = 12.
So, 76 + (81 - 69) = 76 + 12 = 88.
This also uses all numbers [76, 81, 69] exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's verify:
76 + (81 - 69)
76 + 12
88

This is another valid solution. The problem asks for ""an equation"", so either is fine. I'll present the first one I found.

Possibility 3: Multiplication or Division.
If we multiply, the numbers will likely get too large.
81 * 69 is very large.
81 * 76 is very large.
69 * 76 is very large.

What about division?
81 / 69 is not an integer.
81 / 76 is not an integer.
69 / 81 is not an integer.
69 / 76 is not an integer.
76 / 81 is not an integer.
76 / 69 is not an integer.

So, it's unlikely that division will be the primary operation leading to 88 directly from two numbers. It might be used in a more complex expression.

Let's re-examine the addition/subtraction combinations.
We found:
1. 81 + (76 - 69) = 88
2. 76 + (81 - 69) = 88

What about starting with subtraction?
81 - ? = 88. Requires -7. Can we make -7 from 69 and 76?
69 - 76 = -7.
So, 81 - (69 - 76) = 81 - (-7) = 81 + 7 = 88.
This uses all numbers [81, 69, 76] exactly once.

Let's verify:
81 - (69 - 76)
81 - (-7)
81 + 7
88

This is a third valid solution.

What about 69 - ? = 88. Requires -19. Can we make -19 from 81 and 76?
76 - 81 = -5. No.
81 - 76 = 5. No.

What about 76 - ? = 88. Requires -12. Can we make -12 from 81 and 69?
69 - 81 = -12.
So, 76 - (69 - 81) = 76 - (-12) = 76 + 12 = 88.
This uses all numbers [76, 69, 81] exactly once.

Let's verify:
76 - (69 - 81)
76 - (-12)
76 + 12
88

This is a fourth valid solution.

The simplest ones seem to be the first two. I will choose the first one found.

2. Combine smaller numbers first.

Let's try to get close to 23.
63 / ?
28 / ?
64 / ?

Maybe division first?
63 / 4 is not an integer.
63 / 28 is not an integer.
64 / 4 = 16.
If we have 16, we need to get 23 from 63, 28, and 16.
16 + ? = 23. We need 7.
Can we get 7 from 63 and 28?
63 - 28 = 35. No.
63 + 28 = 91. No.
63 * 28 = large. No.
63 / 28 = not integer. No.
28 / 63 = not integer. No.

Let's try another division.
28 / 4 = 7.
Now we have 63, 64, and 7. We need to get 23.
Can we combine 63 and 64 to get something that, when combined with 7, gives 23?
63 + 64 = 127. 127 + 7 = 134. 127 - 7 = 120. 7 - 127 = -120.
63 - 64 = -1. -1 + 7 = 6. -1 - 7 = -8. 7 - (-1) = 8.
64 - 63 = 1. 1 + 7 = 8. 1 - 7 = -6. 7 - 1 = 6.
63 * 64 = large.
63 / 64 = not integer.
64 / 63 = not integer.

Let's try another division.
64 / 28 is not integer.
64 / 63 is not integer.

Let's try multiplication.
4 * 6 = 24 (using 4 and part of 63). No, must use whole numbers.
4 * 28 = 112.
Now we have 63, 64, 112. Need 23.
112 + 63 + 64 = large.
112 - 63 - 64 = 112 - 127 = -15.
63 - 112 + 64 = -49 + 64 = 15.
64 - 112 + 63 = -48 + 63 = 15.

Let's try combining numbers to get something that can be divided.
Maybe (63 + 28) / ?
63 + 28 = 91.
91 / 4 is not integer.
91 / 64 is not integer.

Maybe (64 - 28) / ?
64 - 28 = 36.
36 / 4 = 9.
Now we have 63 and 9. Need 23.
63 - 9 = 54. No.
63 + 9 = 72. No.

Maybe (63 - 4) / ?
63 - 4 = 59. Not divisible by 28 or 64.

Maybe (28 - 4) / ?
28 - 4 = 24.
24 / 63 is not integer.
24 / 64 is not integer.

Let's try subtraction from a larger number.
We need 23.
Maybe something like 64 - X = 23, so X = 41.
Can we get 41 from 63, 28, 4?
63 - 28 + 4 = 35 + 4 = 39. Close.
63 + 4 - 28 = 67 - 28 = 39.
63 - 4 - 28 = 59 - 28 = 31.
28 + 4 - 63 = 32 - 63 = -31.

Maybe something like 63 - X = 23, so X = 40.
Can we get 40 from 28, 4, 64?
64 - 28 + 4 = 36 + 4 = 40. Yes!
So, 63 - (64 - 28 + 4) = 63 - (36 + 4) = 63 - 40 = 23.
This uses all numbers: 63, 64, 28, 4.
Operations: -, -, +, +.

Let's check the order of operations.
63 - (64 - 28 + 4)
Inside the parenthesis:
64 - 28 = 36
36 + 4 = 40
Then:
63 - 40 = 23.

This works.

Let's try another possibility just to be sure.
What if we use division at the end?
(63 + 28 + 4) / ? = 95 / ? No.
(63 + 28 - 4) / ? = 87 / ? No.
(63 - 28 + 4) / ? = 39 / ? No.
(63 - 28 - 4) / ? = 31 / ? No.

What if we use multiplication?
(63 - 4) * ? = 59 * ? No.
(28 - 4) * ? = 24 * ? No.

Let's re-evaluate the first successful attempt: 63 - (64 - 28 + 4) = 23.
This is a valid solution.

Can we write it without parentheses?
63 - 64 + 28 - 4 = -1 + 28 - 4 = 27 - 4 = 23.
This also works and uses all numbers and allowed operations.
63 - 64 + 28 - 4 = 23.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 63, 64, 28, 4 (all used once).
Operations used: -, +, - (allowed).
Result: 23.

This is a simpler form.

Let's try to find another one.
Maybe starting with 28.
28 + ? = 23. Need -5.
Can we get -5 from 63, 4, 64?
4 - 63 + 64 = 4 + 1 = 5. No.
4 + 63 - 64 = 67 - 64 = 3. No.
64 - 63 - 4 = 1 - 4 = -3. No.
63 - 64 - 4 = -1 - 4 = -5. Yes!
So, 28 + (63 - 64 - 4) = 28 + (-1 - 4) = 28 + (-5) = 23.
This uses 28, 63, 64, 4.
Operations: +, +, -, -.

Let's check the order of operations for 28 + 63 - 64 - 4.
28 + 63 = 91
91 - 64 = 27
27 - 4 = 23.
This also works.

Both 63 - 64 + 28 - 4 = 23 and 28 + 63 - 64 - 4 = 23 are valid.
The user asked for ""an equation"". I will provide one.
The first one found was 63 - 64 + 28 - 4.

Let's consider the structure of the output.
<answer>equation</answer>
<think>steps</think>

I will use the equation 63 - 64 + 28 - 4.
It's straightforward and uses the numbers in a clear sequence.
The thinking process involved exploring combinations, trying division and multiplication, and then focusing on subtraction to reach the target. The key was finding a sub-expression that resulted in a number that, when combined with the remaining numbers, yielded ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4373,1196,"<think>The target is 89. The building blocks are [94, 27, 2, 63]. I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try to get close to 89 first.
94 is close to 89. I need to subtract 5.
Can I make 5 from [27, 2, 63]?
27 / ? No.
63 / ? No.
27 - 2 = 25. Not 5.
63 - 27 = 36. Not 5.
63 - 2 = 61. Not 5.

27 + 2 = 29. Not 5.
63 + 27 = 90. Not 5.
63 + 2 = 65. Not 5.

What if I use 94 and subtract something larger?
Maybe I can make 89 directly.

Let's try combining two numbers first.
94 - 2 = 92. Remaining: [27, 63]. Target from these: 89 - 92 = -3. Can't make -3 from 27 and 63.
94 - 27 = 67. Remaining: [2, 63]. Target from these: 89 - 67 = 22. Can't make 22 from 2 and 63.
94 - 63 = 31. Remaining: [2, 27]. Target from these: 89 - 31 = 58. Can't make 58 from 2 and 27.
94 + 2 = 96. Remaining: [27, 63]. Target from these: 89 - 96 = -7. Can't make -7.
94 + 27 = 121. Remaining: [2, 63]. Target from these: 89 - 121 = -32. Can't make -32.
94 + 63 = 157. Remaining: [2, 27]. Target from these: 89 - 157 = -68. Can't make -68.
94 * 2 = 188. Remaining: [27, 63]. Target from these: 89 - 188 = -99. Can't make -99.
94 / 2 = 47. Remaining: [27, 63]. Target from these: 89 - 47 = 42. Can't make 42 from 27 and 63.

Let's try combining three numbers.
Maybe a large number minus a combination of others.
94 - (something from 27, 2, 63) = 89. So, (something from 27, 2, 63) = 5.
We already checked this and couldn't make 5.

Maybe a combination of numbers equals 89.
Let's try multiplication.
27 * 2 = 54. Remaining: [94, 63]. Target: 89. Can I make 89 from 94, 63, 54? No, I need to use the original numbers.
So, 54 + ? = 89. Need 35. Can I make 35 from 94 and 63? No.
54 - ? = 89. Need -35. No.
? - 54 = 89. Need 143. No.

Let's try another combination.
63 * 2 = 126. Remaining: [94, 27]. Target: 89.
126 - ? = 89. Need 37. Can I make 37 from 94 and 27? 94 - 27 = 67. 94 + 27 = 121. No.
? - 126 = 89. Need 215. No.

Let's try division.
63 / ? No integer division.
27 / ? No integer division.

Let's try combining 94 with something else first.
(94 - 27) = 67. Remaining: [2, 63]. Target: 89.
Can I make 89 from 67, 2, 63?
67 + 2 = 69. Need 20 from 63. No.
67 + 63 = 130. Need -41 from 2. No.
67 - 2 = 65. Need 24 from 63. No.
67 - 63 = 4. Need 85 from 2. No.
67 * 2 = 134. Need -45 from 63. No.
67 * 63 = Too big.
67 / 2 = Not integer.
67 / 63 = Not integer.

Let's try (94 - 63) = 31. Remaining: [2, 27]. Target: 89.
Can I make 89 from 31, 2, 27?
31 + 2 = 33. Need 56 from 27. No.
31 + 27 = 58. Need 31 from 2. No.
31 - 2 = 29. Need 60 from 27. No.
31 - 27 = 4. Need 85 from 2. No.
31 * 2 = 62. Need 27 from 27. Yes! 62 + 27 = 89.
So, the expression is (94 - 63) * 2 + 27.
Let's check:
(94 - 63) = 31
31 * 2 = 62
62 + 27 = 89.
This uses all numbers [94, 63, 2, 27] exactly once.

Let's try another path to confirm.
What if 27 is multiplied by something?
27 * 2 = 54. Remaining: [94, 63]. Target: 89.
Can I make 89 from 54, 94, 63?
54 + 94 = 148. Need -59 from 63. No.
54 + 63 = 117. Need -28 from 94. No.
94 - 54 = 40. Need 49 from 63. No.
63 - 54 = 9. Need 80 from 94. No.
94 + 63 - 54 = 157 - 54 = 103. No.
94 - 63 + 54 = 31 + 54 = 85. Close.

Let's try 27 * 63. Too big.

What if 63 is multiplied by something?
63 * 2 = 126. Remaining: [94, 27]. Target: 89.
Can I make 89 from 126, 94, 27?

126 - (94 + 27) = 126 - 121 = 5. No.
(94 + 27) - 126 = 121 - 126 = -5. No.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution: (94 - 63) * 2 + 27 = 89.
This looks correct and uses all numbers.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe something like A * B + C - D = 89.

Possibility 1: Start with 60.
60 - 15 = 45. Then I need to get 56 from 45 and 52. 45 + 52 = 97 (too high). 52 - 45 = 7 (not 56).
60 + 15 = 75. Then I need to get 56 from 75 and 52. 75 - 52 = 23 (not 56). 52 - 75 is negative.
60 * 15 = 900. Too large.
60 / 15 = 4. Then I need to get 56 from 4 and 52. 4 + 52 = 56. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 60, 15, 52. All used exactly once.
Operations used: division, addition. These are fundamental operations.
Equation: (60 / 15) + 52 = 4 + 52 = 56.

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure, although the first one found is often the simplest.

Possibility 2: Start with 52.

52 * 15 = 780. Too large.
52 / 15 is not an integer.

Possibility 3: Start with 15.

15 - 60 is negative.

3175,491,"<think>The target number is 95. The available numbers are [2, 25, 95, 75]. Each number must be used exactly once. Basic operations (+, -, *, /) are allowed.

Let's try to combine the numbers to get close to 95.

One of the numbers is 95. This is a good starting point.
If we use 95 directly, we need to combine the remaining numbers (2, 25, 75) to result in 0.
Can we get 0 from 2, 25, 75 using +, -, *, /?
25 + 75 = 100. 100 - 2 = 98. Not 0.
25 * 2 = 50. 75 - 50 = 25. Not 0.
75 / 25 = 3. 3 - 2 = 1. Not 0.
75 * 2 = 150. 150 - 25 = 125. Not 0.
25 - 2 = 23. 75 - 23 = 52. Not 0.
75 - 25 = 50. 50 - 2 = 48. Not 0.
It seems difficult to get 0 from 2, 25, 75.

Let's try to use 95 in a different way.
Maybe we can get 95 by multiplying or dividing.
If we multiply 25 by something, we get 50 or 75.
25 * 2 = 50. We need to get 95 from 50, 95, 75. This doesn't seem right as we need to use all numbers.

Let's try to combine numbers to get a value that, when combined with 95, results in 95.
For example, if we can make 0 from (2, 25, 75) and add it to 95. We already explored this.
Or if we can make 1 from (2, 25, 75) and multiply it by 95.
Can we get 1 from (2, 25, 75)?
75 / 25 = 3. 3 - 2 = 1. Yes!
So, we can do (75 / 25 - 2) * 95.
Let's check:
75 / 25 = 3
3 - 2 = 1
1 * 95 = 95.
This uses all numbers [2, 25, 75, 95] exactly once and uses basic operations.

Let's write the equation.
(75 / 25 - 2) * 95 = 95

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.
What if we try to get 95 by adding/subtracting from a larger number?
25 * 75 is too large.
25 * 2 = 50.
75 * 2 = 150.
If we have 150, we need to subtract 55. Can we get 55 from 25 and 95? 95 - 25 = 70. 95 + 25 = 120. No.

What if we try to get 95 by adding/subtracting from a smaller number?
Let's try to get a number close to 95 using some numbers and then adjust with the others.
25 * 4 = 100. We don't have 4.
25 * 3 = 75. We have 75.
If we use 25 * 3, we need to get 3 from the remaining numbers (2, 95, 75). This is not possible as we need to use 75 itself.

Let's go back to the successful attempt: (75 / 25 - 2) * 95 = 95.
Numbers used: 75, 25, 2, 95. All used once.
Operations used: /, -, *. Basic operations.
Result: 95.

Let's check if there are other ways.
Maybe something like 95 + (something that equals 0).
We already tried to get 0 from (2, 25, 75) and it seemed difficult.
Let's re-check:
25 + 75 = 100. 100 - 2 = 98.
25 * 2 = 50. 75 - 50 = 25.
75 / 25 = 3. 3 - 2 = 1.
75 * 2 = 150. 150 - 25 = 125.
25 - 2 = 23. 75 - 23 = 52.
75 - 25 = 50. 50 - 2 = 48.
(75 - 25) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25.
(75 + 25) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50.
(25 - 75) / 2 is negative.
(25 * 75) / 2 is not integer.
(25 * 2) - 75 = 50 - 75 = -25.
(75 * 2) - 25 = 150 - 25 = 125.
(75 / 25) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6.
(25 / 75) * 2 is fraction.
25 - (75/2) is fraction.
25 - (75*2) = 25 - 150 = -125.
75 - (25*2) = 75 - 50 = 25.
75 - (25/2) is fraction.
75 - (2/25) is fraction.
2 - (75/25) = 2 - 3 = -1.
2 - (25/75) is fraction.
2 - (75*25) is very negative.

It seems getting 0 from (2, 25, 75) is not straightforward or possible with basic operations.

Let's consider other combinations that result in 95.
Maybe 25 * X + Y = 95.
If X = 3, 25 * 3 = 75. We need Y = 20. Can we get 20 from (2, 95, 75)? No.
If X = 4, 25 * 4 = 100. We need Y = -5. Can we get -5 from (2, 95, 75)? No.

Maybe 75 + X = 95. X = 20. Can we get 20 from (2, 25, 95)?
25 - ? = 20. Need 5. Can't get 5 from (2, 95).
95 / ? = 20. No.
95 - ? = 20. Need 75. We have 75.
So, 75 + (95 - 75) = 75 + 20 = 95. This uses 75 twice. Not allowed.

Let's re-evaluate the successful one: (75 / 25 - 2) * 95 = 95.
This is a valid solution.

Are there any other simple ones?
What if we use 25 and 75 to make 100?
100 - 2 = 98. We have 95 left. 98 - 95 = 3. Not 95.
100 + 2 = 102. We have 95 left. 102 - 95 = 7. Not 95.
100 * 2 = 200. We have 95 left. 200 - 95 = 105. Not 95.
100 / 2 = 50. We have 95 left. 50 + 95 = 145. Not 95.

What if we use 25 and 2 to make 50?
50 + 75 = 125. We have 95 left. 125 - 95 = 30. Not 95.
50 - 75 = -25. We have 9",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
1869,1644,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 56, 2, and 27 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 81.

Let's list the numbers: 56, 2, 27.
The target is 81.

We need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. There are a few possible orders of operations and combinations.

Let's try different combinations:

Possibility 1: Start with multiplication or division.
- (56 * 2) + 27 = 112 + 27 = 139 (Too high)
- (56 / 2) + 27 = 28 + 27 = 55 (Too low)
- (56 * 27) + 2 = Very large number (Too high)
- (56 / 27) ... not an integer, likely not useful.
- (2 * 27) + 56 = 54 + 56 = 110 (Too high)
- (27 / 2) ... not an integer.
- (56 + 2) * 27 = 58 * 27 = 1566 (Too high)
- (56 - 2) * 27 = 54 * 27 = 1458 (Too high)
- (56 + 27) * 2 = 83 * 2 = 166 (Too high)
- (56 - 27) * 2 = 29 * 2 = 58 (Too low)
- (2 + 27) * 56 = 29 * 56 = 1624 (Too high)
- (27 - 2) * 56 = 25 * 56 = 1400 (Too high)

Possibility 2: Start with addition or subtraction.
- 56 + 2 + 27 = 58 + 27 = 85 (Close, but not 81)
- 56 + 2 - 27 = 58 - 27 = 31 (Too low)
- 56 - 2 + 27 = 54 + 27 = 81 (This works!)

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 56, 2, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +. Allowed operations.
Result: 81. Target achieved.

The equation is 56 - 2 + 27 = 81.

Let's consider other arrangements just to be sure.
- 56 + 27 - 2 = 83 - 2 = 81 (This also works and is essentially the same calculation due to commutativity of addition)
- 27 + 56 - 2 = 83 - 2 = 81
- 27 - 2 + 56 = 25 + 56 = 81

The order of operations matters if we introduce parentheses.
Let's re-check the first set of possibilities with parentheses.

We found 56 - 2 + 27 = 81. This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there are other solutions.
What if we use division in a way that results in an integer?
- 56 / 2 = 28. Then we have 28 and 27.
  - 28 + 27 = 55 (Already checked)
  - 28 - 27 = 1
  - 27 - 28 = -1
  - 28 * 27 = 756

What if we use 27 / ?
- 27 / 56 (not integer)
- 27 / 2 (not integer)

What if we use 2 / ?
- 2 / 56 (not integer)
- 2 / 27 (not integer)

What if we use 56 / ?
- 56 / 2 = 28. We have 28 and 27.
  - 28 + 27 = 55
  - 28 - 27 = 1
  - 27 - 28 = -1
  - 28 * 27 = 756

Let's consider the structure (a op b) op c.
We found (56 - 2) + 27 = 54 + 27 = 81.
We found 56 + (27 - 2) = 56 + 25 = 81.
We found (56 + 27) - 2 = 83 - 2 = 81.

Let's try other structures.
a op (b op c)
- 56 + (2 - 27) = 56 + (-25) = 31
- 56 - (2 + 27) = 56 - 29 = 27

- 56 * (2 + 27) = 56 * 29 = 1624
- 56 / (2 + 27) = 56 / 29 (not integer)
- 56 / (27 - 2) = 56 / 25 (not integer)

- 2 + (56 - 27) = 2 + 29 = 31
- 2 - (56 + 27) = 2 - 83 = -81
- 2 * (56 + 27) = 2 * 83 = 166
- 2 * (56 - 27) = 2 * 29 = 58

- 27 + (56 - 2) = 27 + 54 = 81 (This is the same as 56 - 2 + 27)
- 27 - (56 - 2) = 27 - 54 = -27
- 27 * (56 - 2) = 27 * 54 = 1458

Let's consider the structure a op b op c without explicit parentheses, relying on standard order of operations (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction).
- 56 + 2 * 27 = 56 + 54 = 110
- 56 - 2 * 27 = 56 - 54 = 2
- 56 * 2 + 27 = 112 + 27 = 139
- 56 * 2 - 27 = 112 - 27 = 85
- 56 / 2 + 27 = 28 + 27 = 55
- 56 / 2 - 27 = 28 - 27 = 1
- 2 + 56 * 27 = 2 + 1512 = 1514
- 2 - 56 * 27 = 2 - 1512 = -1510
- 2 * 56 + 27 = 112 + 27 = 139
- 2 * 56 - 27 = 112 - 27 = 85
- 27 + 56 * 2 = 27 + 112 = 139
- 27 - 56 * 2 = 27 - 112 = -85
- 27 * 56 + 2 = 1512 + 2 = 1514
- 27 * 56 - 2 = 1512 - 2 = 1510

The simplest solution found is 56 - 2 + 27 = 81.
This can also be written as 56 + 27 - 2 = 81.
Or 27 + 56 - 2 = 81.
Or 27 - 2 + 56 = 81.

The problem asks for ""an equation"". Any of these are valid.
Let's stick with the first one we found: 56 - 2 + 27 = 81.

Let's double check the steps.

Operations: +, -, *, /. Each number used once.

Let's try different combinations and see if we can reach 26.

Numbers: 4, 66, 58, 94
Target: 26

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create smaller numbers that can be combined.

Let's try combining 94 and 66 first.
94 - 66 = 28. We need to get 26 from 28 using 4 and 58.
28 - (58 / 4) - not an integer.
28 + (58 / 4) - not an integer.
28 - (4 / 58) - not useful.
28 + (4 / 58) - not useful.
28 - 58 + 4 = -26. Close, but wrong sign.
28 + 58 - 4 = 82.
28 - 4 - 58 = -34.
28 + 4 - 58 = -26. Wrong sign.

Let's try 94 and 58.
94 - 58 = 36. We need to get 26 from 36 using 4 and 66.
36 - (66 / 4) - not integer.
36 + (66 / 4) - not integer.
36 - 66 + 4 = -26. Wrong sign.
36 + 66 - 4 = 98.
36 - 4 - 66 = -34.
36 + 4 - 66 = -26. Wrong sign.

Let's try 66 and 58.
66 - 58 = 8. We need to get 26 from 8 using 4 and 94.
8 + (94 / 4) - not integer.
8 - (94 / 4) - not integer.
8 + 94 - 4 = 98.
8 - 94 + 4 = -82.
8 + 4 - 94 = -82.
8 - 4 + 94 = 98.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe we can create a number close to 26 and adjust.
(66 / 4) - not integer.
(58 / 4) - not integer.
(94 / 4) - not integer.

Let's try combining smaller numbers first.
4 * 66 = 264.
4 * 58 = 232.
4 * 94 = 376.

Let's try division first.
66 / ?
58 / ?
94 / ?
4 / ?

Consider the target 26.
Maybe we can get something like 30 - 4 or 20 + 6.

Let's try to make 30.
Using 66, 58, 94, 4.
(94 + 58) / 4 = 152 / 4 = 38.
38 - 66 = -28.
38 + 66 = 104.

(66 + 58) / 4 = 124 / 4 = 31.
31 - 94 = -63.
31 + 94 = 125.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by 4, gives something useful.
Or a number that, when 4 is subtracted from it, gives something useful.

Let's try to get 26 by subtracting something from a larger number.
Maybe (94 + 66) - something = 26?
160 - something = 26 => something = 134. Can we make 134 from 58 and 4? No.

Maybe (94 + 58) - something = 26?
152 - something = 26 => something = 126. Can we make 126 from 66 and 4? No.

Maybe (66 + 58) - something = 26?
124 - something = 26 => something = 98. Can we make 98 from 94 and 4? Yes, 94 + 4 = 98.
So, (66 + 58) - (94 + 4) = 124 - 98 = 26.
This uses all numbers once and only +, -. This is a valid solution.

Let's check if there are other possibilities.

What if we use multiplication and division?
Try to get a number close to 26.
(94 / 2) - not possible as 2 is not in the list.

Let's try to get 26 from (A * B) + C + D or similar.
4 * 66 = 264. Too big.
4 * 58 = 232. Too big.
4 * 94 = 376. Too big.

Let's try division first.
(66 / 4) - not integer.
(58 / 4) - not integer.
(94 / 4) - not integer.

What about (A / B) * C + D?
(66 / ?)
(58 / ?)
(94 / ?)

Let's re-examine the solution found: (66 + 58) - (94 + 4) = 26.
This is a good solution.

Let's try to see if we can use multiplication.
Maybe something like (A - B) * C + D?
(66 - 58) * 4 + 94 = 8 * 4 + 94 = 32 + 94 = 126.
(94 - 66) * 4 + 58 = 28 * 4 + 58 = 112 + 58 = 170.
(94 - 58) * 4 + 66 = 36 * 4 + 66 = 144 + 66 = 210.

Maybe (A + B) / C * D?
(66 + 58) / 4 * 94 = 124 / 4 * 94 = 31 * 94 = 2914.

Let's try to get 26 by dividing a larger number.
Maybe (X) / 4 = 26 => X = 104. Can we make 104 from 66, 58, 94?
66 + 58 - 94 = 124 - 94 = 30. No.
94 + 66 - 58 = 160 - 58 = 102. Close.
94 + 58 - 66 = 152 - 66 = 86.

Maybe (X) / 2 = 26 => X = 52. Not possible as 2 is not available.

Let's try to get 26 by multiplying something by 4.
Maybe X * 4 = 26 => X = 6.5. Not possible.

Let's try to get 26 by subtracting 4 from something.
X - 4 = 26 => X = 30. Can we make 30 from 66, 58, 94?
94 - 66 + 58 = 28 + 58 = 86.
66 - 58 + 94 = 8 + 94 = 102.
94 - 58 - 66 = 36 - 66 = -30.
66 + 58 - 94 = 124 - 94 = 30.
So, (66 + 58 - 94) - 4 = 30 - 4 = 26.
This uses 66, 58, 94, 4. Operations are +, -, -. This is also a valid solution.
(66 + 58 - 94) - 4 = 26.

Let's try to get 26 by adding 4 to something.
X + 4 = 26 => X = 22. Can we make 22 from 66, 58, 94?

- 69 / (67 - 48) + 64 = 69 / 19 + 64 (Fraction)

Let's try subtraction from a larger product.
- (67 * 48) - 64 - 69 = 3216 - 64 - 69 = 3152 - 69 = 3083 (Too large)
- (67 * 64) - 48 - 69 = 4288 - 48 - 69 = 4240 - 69 = 4171 (Too large)

Let's try to get a number close to 39 and adjust.
- 64 - 48 = 16

- 67 - 48 = 19

- 69 - 48 = 21
- 67 - 64 = 3
- 21 + 3 = 24 (Used 69, 48, 67, 64)

- 69 - 64 = 5
- 67 - 48 = 19
- 5 + 19 = 24 (Used 69, 64, 67, 48)

Let's try multiplication and then subtraction.
- 67 * 48 = 3216
- 64 * 69 = 4288

Consider (A * B) - (C * D) or similar.
We need a result around 39.
Maybe a large number minus a slightly smaller large number.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 39 and subtract.

- 64 + 48 = 112

1389,409,"<think>The problem asks us to combine the numbers 1, 70, and 84 using the operations +, -, *, or / to reach the target number 14. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 1, 70, 84.
Target: 14.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

We need to try different combinations and see if we can reach 14.

Possible structures for combining three numbers (a, b, c) are:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try using the largest numbers first, as they are more likely to influence the result significantly.

Consider 84 and 70.
84 + 70 = 154
84 - 70 = 14. This is interesting! If we can use the number 1 to not change this result, we might have a solution.
84 * 70 = 5880
84 / 70 = 1.2 (not an integer, might be tricky)
70 - 84 = -14
70 / 84 = 5/6

Let's focus on the 84 - 70 = 14 result.
We have used 84 and 70. The remaining number is 1.
We need to combine 1 with 14 using an operation to still get 14.
Possible operations with 1 and 14:
14 + 1 = 15 (not 14)
14 - 1 = 13 (not 14)
14 * 1 = 14 (This works!)
14 / 1 = 14 (This also works!)

So, if we have (84 - 70) and we multiply it by 1, we get 14.
The expression would be (84 - 70) * 1.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 84, 70, 1. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, *. Yes.
Let's check the result: (84 - 70) * 1 = 14 * 1 = 14. Yes.

Alternatively, if we have (84 - 70) and we divide it by 1, we get 14.
The expression would be (84 - 70) / 1.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 84, 70, 1. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, /. Yes.
Let's check the result: (84 - 70) / 1 = 14 / 1 = 14. Yes.

Both (84 - 70) * 1 and (84 - 70) / 1 are valid solutions. The problem asks for ""an equation"", so either is fine. I'll pick the multiplication one.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough.

What if we start with 70 and 1?
70 + 1 = 71. Combine 71 with 84.
71 + 84 = 155
71 - 84 = -13
84 - 71 = 13
71 * 84 = 5964
84 / 71 (not integer)

70 - 1 = 69. Combine 69 with 84.
69 + 84 = 153
84 - 69 = 15
69 * 84 = 5796
84 / 69 (not integer)

70 * 1 = 70. Combine 70 with 84.
70 + 84 = 154
84 - 70 = 14. This leads back to the previous solution structure: (84 - (70 * 1)) = 14. This is also valid.
70 * 84 = 5880
84 / 70 = 1.2

70 / 1 = 70. Combine 70 with 84.
This is the same as the previous case.

What if we start with 84 and 1?
84 + 1 = 85. Combine 85 with 70.
85 + 70 = 155
85 - 70 = 15
70 - 85 = -15
85 * 70 = 5950
70 / 85 (not integer)

84 - 1 = 83. Combine 83 with 70.
83 + 70 = 153
83 - 70 = 13
70 - 83 = -13
83 * 70 = 5810
70 / 83 (not integer)

84 * 1 = 84. Combine 84 with 70.
84 + 70 = 154
84 - 70 = 14. This leads back to the previous solution structure: (84 * 1) - 70 = 14. This is also valid.
84 * 70 = 5880
70 / 84 (not integer)

84 / 1 = 84. Combine 84 with 70.
This is the same as the previous case.

Let's consider division involving 70 or 84.
84 / ?
If we divide 84 by something, we need the result to be related to 14.
84 / 6 = 14. Can we make 6 from 70 and 1? No.
84 / (70/?) - doesn't seem promising.

70 / ?
70 / 5 = 14. Can we make 5 from 84 and 1? No.

Let's try combining 70 and 84 first in a way that results in a number that, when combined with 1, gives 14.
We already found 84 - 70 = 14. Then 14 * 1 = 14 or 14 / 1 = 14.
This gives (84 - 70) * 1 = 14 and (84 - 70) / 1 = 14.

We also found 70 * 1 = 70. Then 84 - 70 = 14.
This gives 84 - (70 * 1) = 14.

We also found 84 * 1 = 84. Then 84 - 70 = 14.
This gives (84 * 1) - 70 = 14.

Let's check the structure a op1 (b op2 c).

Example: 1 + (84 / 70) - not integer.
Example: 1 * (84 / 70) - not integer.

Let's consider division where the result is 14.
We found 84 - 70 = 14.
We need to incorporate 1.
(84 - 70) * 1 = 14.
(84 - 70) / 1 = 14.

5397,1769,"<think>The numbers are 17, 95, and 19. The target value is 97.
I need to use each number exactly once with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Let's explore combinations.
The target 97 is relatively close to 95. This suggests that 95 might be a starting point, and the other numbers (17 and 19) are used to adjust it.

Possibility 1: Start with 95.
How can I get from 95 to 97 using 17 and 19?
I need to add 2.
Can I combine 17 and 19 to get 2?
19 - 17 = 2.
So, 95 + (19 - 17) = 95 + 2 = 97.
This uses all numbers (95, 19, 17) exactly once and achieves the target.

Let's check other possibilities to be thorough.

Possibility 2: Start with 17.
If I multiply 17 by something, it will likely get too large quickly.
17 * 19 = 323 (too large)
17 * 95 = 1615 (too large)

Possibility 3: Start with 19.
19 * 17 = 323 (too large)
19 * 95 = 1805 (too large)

Possibility 4: Using division.
Division might be tricky as the numbers are not easily divisible to produce integers that would help reach 97.
95 / 17 is not an integer.
95 / 19 = 5.
If I have 5, I need to combine it with 17 to get 97.
5 + 17 = 22 (too low)
5 * 17 = 85 (close, but need 12 more. I've used 95, 19, 17. No numbers left.)
17 - 5 = 12 (too low)
5 - 17 = -12 (too low)

Let's reconsider the first successful approach: 95 + (19 - 17).
This uses 95, 19, and 17.
The operations are addition and subtraction.
Each number is used once.
The result is 97.

This seems to be the most straightforward and correct solution.
The order of operations is important. Parentheses ensure 19 - 17 is calculated first.

The user wants an equation using the numbers [20, 78, 39, 32] to reach the target 26.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are allowed.

Let's list the numbers: 20, 78, 39, 32.
Target: 26.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to get 26.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite spread out. 78 and 39 are multiples of 3 and 13. 20 and 32 are multiples of 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16.

Let's consider the larger numbers first.
78 and 39.
78 / 39 = 2. This is a small number.
If I have 2, I need to get 26 from 20 and 32.
20 + 32 = 52. 52 / 2 = 26.
So, (20 + 32) / (78 / 39) = 52 / 2 = 26.
This looks promising.
Let's check the constraints:
Numbers used: 20, 32, 78, 39. All used once.
Operations used: +, /, /. Basic operations.
Result: 26. Correct.

Let's try another approach to be sure.
What if I subtract?
78 - 39 = 39.
Now I have 39, 20, 32. Target 26.
39 - 20 = 19. Need 26 from 19 and 32. 19 + 32 = 51. 32 - 19 = 13. No.
39 - 32 = 7. Need 26 from 7 and 20. 7 + 20 = 27. Close. 20 - 7 = 13. No.

What if I multiply?
20 * 32 = 640. Too big.
20 * 39 = 780. Too big.
20 * 78 = 1560. Too big.
32 * 39 = 1248. Too big.
32 * 78 = 2496. Too big.
39 * 78 = 3042. Too big.

Division seems more likely to reduce the numbers.
78 / 20 is not an integer.
78 / 32 is not an integer.
39 / 20 is not an integer.
39 / 32 is not an integer.
32 / 20 is not an integer.

So, the divisions that result in integers are:
78 / 39 = 2
39 / ? (no other number divides 39 to give an integer)
32 / ? (no other number divides 32 to give an integer)
20 / ? (no other number divides 20 to give an integer)

So, the only integer division possible between two of the numbers is 78 / 39 = 2.
This leaves us with the numbers 20, 32, and the result 2. We need to combine these to get 26.
We have 20, 32, and 2. Target 26.
Possible combinations:
(20 + 32) / 2 = 52 / 2 = 26. This is the one I found earlier.
(20 * 2) - 32 = 40 - 32 = 8. No.
(32 * 2) - 20 = 64 - 20 = 44. No.
(20 / 2) + 32 = 10 + 32 = 42. No.
(32 / 2) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36. No.
32 - (20 / 2) = 32 - 10 = 22. No.
20 - (32 / 2) = 20 - 16 = 4. No.
32 + 20 - 2 = 50. No.
32 - 20 + 2 = 14. No.
20 - 32 + 2 = -10. No.

Let's consider other ways to use the 2.
Maybe the 2 is used in multiplication with one of the other numbers.
If we have 2, 20, 32.
2 * 20 = 40. Need 26 from 40 and 32. 40 - 32 = 8. No.
2 * 32 = 64. Need 26 from 64 and 20. 64 - 20 = 44. No.

What if the division is not the first operation?

The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers 68, 90, and 6 to reach the target value of 16.
I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [68, 90, 6]
Target: 16

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations to get 16.

Possible combinations and operations:
1.  (68 op1 90) op2 6 = 16
2.  (68 op1 6) op2 90 = 16
3.  (90 op1 68) op2 6 = 16
4.  (90 op1 6) op2 68 = 16
5.  (6 op1 68) op2 90 = 16
6.  (6 op1 90) op2 68 = 16

Let's try some combinations.

Try starting with 90 and 68.
90 + 68 = 158 (Too large)
90 - 68 = 22
   22 + 6 = 28 (Not 16)
   22 - 6 = 16 (This works!)
   22 * 6 = 132 (Not 16)
   22 / 6 = Not an integer (Not useful for simple integer arithmetic)

So, (90 - 68) - 6 = 16.
Let's check if this uses all numbers and operations correctly.
Numbers used: 90, 68, 6. Yes, all used once.
Operations used: subtraction, subtraction. Yes, allowed.
Result: (90 - 68) - 6 = 22 - 6 = 16. Yes, target reached.

Let's try another path to be sure.
What if I start with 68 and 6?
68 + 6 = 74
   74 + 90 = 164
   74 - 90 = -16
   74 * 90 = large
   74 / 90 = not integer

68 - 6 = 62
   62 + 90 = 152
   62 - 90 = -28
   62 * 90 = large
   62 / 90 = not integer

68 * 6 = 408
   408 + 90 = 498
   408 - 90 = 318
   408 / 90 = not integer

68 / 6 = not integer

What if I start with 90 and 6?
90 + 6 = 96
   96 + 68 = 164
   96 - 68 = 28
   96 * 68 = large
   96 / 68 = not integer

90 - 6 = 84
   84 + 68 = 152
   84 - 68 = 16 (This works too!)
   84 * 68 = large
   84 / 68 = not integer

So, (90 - 6) - 68 = 16.
Numbers used: 90, 6, 68. Yes, all used once.
Operations used: subtraction, subtraction. Yes, allowed.
Result: (90 - 6) - 68 = 84 - 68 = 16. Yes, target reached.

Both (90 - 68) - 6 = 16 and (90 - 6) - 68 = 16 are valid solutions. I will present one. The first one I found seems straightforward.

Let's double check the rules:
- Numbers: [68 90 6] - used exactly once. Yes.
- Target: 16 - reached exactly. Yes.
- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division only. Yes.

The equation (90 - 68) - 6 = 16 fits all criteria.
I can also write it as 90 - 68 - 6 = 16 since subtraction is left-associative.
Or 90 - (68 + 6) = 90 - 74 = 16. This also works and uses subtraction and addition.
Let's check 90 - (68 + 6) = 16.
Numbers used: 90, 68, 6. Yes.
Operations: subtraction, addition. Yes.
Result: 90 - (68 + 6) = 90 - 74 = 16. Yes.

This last one is also a good candidate. I'll choose this one as it uses two different operations.

Let's verify again:
Numbers: 68, 90, 6. Used once.
Target: 16. Reached.
Operations: -, +. Allowed.
Equation: 90 - (68 + 6) = 16.

This looks solid.

The user wants an equation that results in 57 using the numbers 39, 55, and 41 exactly once. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: [39, 55, 41].
The target is 57.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for the operations, and each operation has 4 choices. This gives a large number of possibilities, but many will be redundant due to the commutative property of addition and multiplication.

Let's try to combine two numbers first and then use the third.

Possible pairs and their combinations:
1.  39 and 55:
    *   39 + 55 = 94
    *   39 - 55 = -16
    *   55 - 39 = 16
    *   39 * 55 = 2145
    *   39 / 55 (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 57 easily)
    *   55 / 39 (not an integer)

2.  39 and 41:
    *   39 + 41 = 80
    *   39 - 41 = -2
    *   41 - 39 = 2
    *   39 * 41 = 1599
    *   39 / 41 (not an integer)
    *   41 / 39 (not an integer)

3.  55 and 41:
    *   55 + 41 = 96
    *   55 - 41 = 14
    *   41 - 55 = -14
    *   55 * 41 = 2255
    *   55 / 41 (not an integer)
    *   41 / 55 (not an integer)

Now, let's take these intermediate results and combine them with the remaining number to reach 57.

Case 1: Using 39 + 55 = 94. Remaining number is 41.
    *   94 + 41 = 135 (Too high)
    *   94 - 41 = 53 (Close, but not 57)
    *   41 - 94 = -53 (Not 57)
    *   94 * 41 (Too high)
    *   94 / 41 (Not integer)
    *   41 / 94 (Not integer)

Case 2: Using 55 - 39 = 16. Remaining number is 41.
    *   16 + 41 = 57 (Bingo! This works.)
    *   Let's check the order of operations. The expression is (55 - 39) + 41. This uses all numbers once and only addition and subtraction.

Let's verify this solution:
(55 - 39) + 41 = 16 + 41 = 57.
This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to ensure this is the most straightforward or to see if there are others.

Case 3: Using 39 + 41 = 80. Remaining number is 55.
    *   80 + 55 = 135 (Too high)
    *   80 - 55 = 25 (Not 57)
    *   55 - 80 = -25 (Not 57)
    *   80 * 55 (Too high)
    *   80 / 55 (Not integer)
    *   55 / 80 (Not integer)

Case 4: Using 41 - 39 = 2. Remaining number is 55.
    *   2 + 55 = 57 (Bingo! This also works.)
    *   The expression is (41 - 39) + 55. This uses all numbers once and only addition and subtraction.

Let's verify this solution:
(41 - 39) + 55 = 2 + 55 = 57.
This is also a valid solution.

Case 5: Using 55 + 41 = 96. Remaining number is 39.
    *   96 + 39 = 135 (Too high)
    *   96 - 39 = 57 (Bingo! This also works.)
    *   The expression is (55 + 41) - 39. This uses all numbers once and only addition and subtraction.

Let's verify this solution:
(55 + 41) - 39 = 96 - 39 = 57.
This is also a valid solution.

Case 6: Using 55 - 41 = 14. Remaining number is 39.
    *   14 + 39 = 53 (Close, but not 57)
    *   39 + 14 = 53 (Same)
    *   14 - 39 = -25 (Not 57)
    *   39 - 14 = 25 (Not 57)
    *   14 * 39 (Too high)
    *   14 / 39 (Not integer)
    *   39 / 14 (Not integer)

What about multiplication?
Let's try to get a number close to 57 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the third.
The numbers are 39, 55, 41.
None of these numbers are factors of 57 (57 = 3 * 19).

Let's consider division.
If we divide, we need to get an integer result.
Possible integer divisions:
*   None of the numbers are divisible by each other to produce an integer.

Let's try to construct expressions that might lead to 57.
We found three solutions using only addition and subtraction:
1.  (55 - 39) + 41 = 57
2.  (41 - 39) + 55 = 57
3.  (55 + 41) - 39 = 57

Let's check if any combination involving multiplication or division could work.
Suppose we use multiplication first.
*   39 * (something)
*   55 * (something)
*   41 * (something)

Let's try to get a number that, when combined with the third number, gives 57.
Example: A * B + C = 57 or A * B - C = 57 or C - A * B = 57.

Consider 39.
*   39 + X = 57 => X = 18. Can we get 18 from 55 and 41?
    *   55 - 41 = 14 (No)
    *   41 - 55 = -14 (No)
    *   55 + 41 = 96 (No)
    *   55 * 41 (Too big)
    *   55 / 41 (No)
    *   41 / 55 (No)
*   39 - X = 57 => X = -18. Can we get -18 from 55 and 41? No.
*   X - 39 = 57 => X = 96. Can we get 96 from 55 and 41?
    *   55 + 41 = 96. Yes!
    *   So, (55 + 41) - 39 = 57. This is one of the solutions we already found.

Consider 55.
*   55 + X = 57 => X = 2. Can we get 2 from 39 and 41?
    *   41 - 39 = 2. Yes!
    *   So, 55 + (41 - 39) = 57. This is another solution we found.
*   55 - X = 57 => X = -2. Can we get -2 from 39 and 41?
    *   39 - 41 = -2. Yes!
    *   So, 55 - (39 - 41) = 55 - (-2) = 57. This is a new one. Let's verify: 55 - (39 - 41) = 55 - (-2) = 57",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4018,647,"<think>The user wants an equation that uses the numbers 77, 63, 64, and 99 exactly once, along with the operators +, -, *, /, to equal 23.

Let's list the numbers: [77, 63, 64, 99]
Target: 23

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite large, so division might be useful to reduce them.
77 / 7 = 11 (but 7 is not available)
63 / 7 = 9 (but 7 is not available)
64 / 8 = 8 (but 8 is not available)
99 / 9 = 11 (but 9 is not available)
99 / 11 = 9 (but 11 is not available)

Let's look for potential divisions between the given numbers.
77 / 63 - not a whole number
77 / 64 - not a whole number
77 / 99 - not a whole number
63 / 77 - not a whole number
63 / 64 - not a whole number
63 / 99 - not a whole number
64 / 77 - not a whole number
64 / 63 - not a whole number
64 / 99 - not a whole number
99 / 77 - not a whole number
99 / 63 - not a whole number
99 / 64 - not a whole number

It seems direct division between the given numbers won't yield simple integers. This suggests that division might be used in a way that results in a fraction that is then combined, or division might be the last operation, or it might be used on intermediate results.

Let's try to get close to 23.
The numbers are roughly around 60-80.
If I add them all: 77 + 63 + 64 + 99 = 303. Too big.
If I subtract some:
Maybe I can create a large number and subtract a larger number.
Or create a small number and add to it.

Let's try to make smaller numbers first.
77 - 63 = 14
77 - 64 = 13
77 - 99 = -22
63 - 77 = -14
63 - 64 = -1
63 - 99 = -36
64 - 77 = -13
64 - 63 = 1
64 - 99 = -35
99 - 77 = 22
99 - 63 = 36
99 - 64 = 35

Let's try using multiplication to get larger numbers, then subtract.
Maybe (99 * something) - (something else) = 23.
Or (something) - (99 * something) = 23.

Let's try combining two numbers first and see what we get.
(99 - 77) = 22. We have 63 and 64 left. Can we make 1 from 63 and 64? Yes, 64 - 63 = 1.
So, (99 - 77) + (64 - 63) = 22 + 1 = 23.
This uses all numbers and only allowed operations.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 99, 77, 64, 63. All used once.
Operations used: -, +, -. All allowed.
Result: 23.

This looks like a valid solution.
Let's write it out clearly.
(99 - 77) + (64 - 63)
= 22 + 1
= 23

Another possibility:
What if we try to get a number close to 23 by division?
Maybe something like (large number) / (small number) = 23.
Or (number) * (number) + (number) - (number) = 23.

Let's try another path just to be sure.
Consider 64.
If we do 64 / (something), it's unlikely to be an integer unless the divisor is a factor of 64.
Factors of 64: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. None of these are directly available or easily made from the other numbers.

Let's try multiplication.
77 * 63 - too big.
77 * 64 - too big.
77 * 99 - too big.
63 * 64 - too big.
63 * 99 - too big.
64 * 99 - too big.

What about smaller multiplications?
Maybe (77 / 7) * ... - but 7 is not available.

Let's go back to the subtraction idea.
We found (99 - 77) + (64 - 63) = 23.

Let's try to rearrange the terms.
(64 - 63) + (99 - 77) = 1 + 22 = 23. Same equation, just order of addition changed.

What about subtraction as the last step?
(Something) - (Something) = 23.
Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 23 and subtract a small number.
Or a number much larger and subtract a number much larger.

Consider 99.
If we do 99 - X = 23, then X = 76. Can we make 76 from 77, 63, 64?
77 - 63 + 64 = 14 + 64 = 78 (close)
77 + 63 - 64 = 140 - 64 = 76.
So, 99 - (77 + 63 - 64) = 99 - (140 - 64) = 99 - 76 = 23.
This uses 99, 77, 63, 64. All used once. Operations: -, +, -. All allowed.
This is another valid solution.

Let's verify:
99 - (77 + 63 - 64)
= 99 - (140 - 64)
= 99 - 76
= 23

Let's try another one.
Consider 77.
If we do 77 - X = 23, then X = 54. Can we make 54 from 63, 64, 99?
63 - 99 + 64 = -36 + 64 = 28 (not 54)
99 - 63 + 64 = 36 + 64 = 100 (not 54)
64 - 63 + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100 (not 54)

If we do X - 77 = 23, then X = 100. Can we make 100 from 63, 64, 99?
63 + 64 - 99 = 127 - 99 = 28 (not 100)
64 + 99 - 63 = 163 - 63 = 100.
So, (64 + 99 - 63) - 77 = 100 - 77 = 23.
This uses 64, 99, 63, 77. All used once. Operations: +, -, -. All allowed.
This is a third valid solution.

Let's verify:
(64 + 99 - 63) - 77
= (163 - 63) - 77
= 100 - 77
= 23

The first solution found, (99 - 77) + (64 - 63), is quite elegant and simple.
The second solution, 99 - (77 + 63 - 64), is also good.
The third solution, (64 + 99 - 63) - 77, is also valid.

The prompt asks for ""a valid mathematical equation"". Any of these will do. I'll present the first one I found as it's straightforward.

The user wants an equation that evaluates to 65 using the numbers [68, 32, 71, 99] exactly once, with only +, -, *, / operations.

Target: 65
Numbers: [68, 32, 71, 99]

Let's analyze the numbers and the target.
The numbers are relatively large. The target is relatively small. This suggests that division or subtraction will likely be involved to reduce the magnitude.

Possible strategies:
1. Try to get close to 65 by combining two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
2. Try to create a large number and then subtract a larger number from it.
3. Try to create a number close to 65 using division.

Let's explore combinations:

Consider the largest numbers first: 99 and 71.
99 - 71 = 28. Remaining numbers: [68, 32]. Target difference: 65 - 28 = 37. Can we get 37 from 68 and 32?
68 + 32 = 100
68 - 32 = 36 (Close!)
68 * 32 = large
68 / 32 = not integer

If we have 36, we need 1 more. Can we get 1 from the remaining numbers? No, we've used all of them.
So, (99 - 71) + (68 - 32) = 28 + 36 = 64. Very close, but not 65.

Let's try another combination with 99 and 71.
99 + 71 = 170. Remaining numbers: [68, 32]. Target difference: 65 - 170 = -105. Not helpful.
99 * 71 = large.
99 / 71 = not integer.

Consider 99 and 68.
99 - 68 = 31. Remaining numbers: [71, 32]. Target difference: 65 - 31 = 34. Can we get 34 from 71 and 32?
71 - 32 = 39 (Close!)
71 + 32 = 103
71 * 32 = large
71 / 32 = not integer

If we have 39, we need to subtract 5. Can we get 5 from the remaining numbers? No.
So, (99 - 68) + (71 - 32) = 31 + 39 = 70. Close.

Consider 99 and 32.
99 - 32 = 67. Remaining numbers: [68, 71]. Target difference: 65 - 67 = -2. Can we get -2 from 68 and 71?
71 - 68 = 3. Not -2.
68 - 71 = -3. Not -2.

Consider 71 and 68.
71 - 68 = 3. Remaining numbers: [99, 32]. Target difference: 65 - 3 = 62. Can we get 62 from 99 and 32?
99 - 32 = 67. Close.
99 + 32 = 131.
99 / 32 = not integer.

Consider 71 and 32.
71 - 32 = 39. Remaining numbers: [68, 99]. Target difference: 65 - 39 = 26. Can we get 26 from 68 and 99?
99 - 68 = 31. Close.

Consider 68 and 32.
68 - 32 = 36. Remaining numbers: [71, 99]. Target difference: 65 - 36 = 29. Can we get 29 from 71 and 99?
99 - 71 = 28. Close.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe we can get a number slightly larger than 65 and subtract.
Or a number slightly smaller and add.

What if we use division to get a smaller number first?
32 / ? - not useful.
68 / ? - not useful.
71 / ? - not useful.
99 / ? - not useful.

Let's try to create a number that, when operated with another, gets us closer.
Example: (99 - 32) = 67. We need to get -2 from 68 and 71. (68 - 71) = -3. (71 - 68) = 3. No.

Let's try to get a number that divides nicely.
Maybe we can form a number that divides 99 or 32 or 68 or 71.
For example, if we can make 3, then 99/3 = 33.
Can we make 3 from [68, 32, 71]?
71 - 68 = 3. Yes.
So, 99 / (71 - 68) = 99 / 3 = 33.
Remaining number is 32.
We have 33 and 32. Target is 65.
33 + 32 = 65.
This looks like a valid solution!

Let's check the numbers used: 99, 71, 68, 32. All used exactly once.
Operations used: /, -, +. Allowed.
Result: 65. Correct.

The equation is: 99 / (71 - 68) + 32

Let's verify the order of operations:
1. Parentheses: (71 - 68) = 3
2. Division: 99 / 3 = 33
3. Addition: 33 + 32 = 65

This works.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough.
What if we try to make a number that, when multiplied by something, gets close to 65?
For example, if we can make 5, then 5 * 13 = 65. Can we make 13?
From [68, 32, 71, 99].
99 - 68 = 31
71 - 32 = 39
No obvious way to make 13.

What if we try to make a number that, when subtracted from another, gives 65?
Example: X - Y = 65.
Let X be a combination of two numbers, and Y be a combination of the other two.
Or X is one number, and Y is a combination of three.

Let's revisit the 64 result: (99 - 71) + (68 - 32) = 28 + 36 = 64.
We need to increase the result by 1.
Can we rearrange the operations or numbers?

Consider (99 - 32) = 67. Remaining [68, 71]. Target difference: 65 - 67 = -2.
Can we get -2 from 68 and 71?
68 - 71 = -3.
71 - 68 = 3.
No.

Consider (71 - 32) = 39. Remaining [68, 99]. Target difference: 65 - 39 = 26.
Can we get 26 from 68 and 99?
99 - 68 = 31.
No.

Consider (68 - 32) = 36. Remaining [71, 99]. Target difference: 65 - 36 = 29.
Can we get 29 from 71 and 99?
99 - 71 = 28. Close.

Let's try division again.
Can we make a number that divides 32? Like 2, 4, 8, 16.
From [68, 71, 99].
71 - 68 = 3.
99 - 71 = 28.
99 - 68 = 31.
No easy way to make 2, 4, 8, 16.

Can we make a number that divides 68? Like 2, 4, 17, 34.
From [32, 71, 99].
71 - 32 = 39.
99 - 32 = 67.

The user wants an arithmetic expression using the numbers 38, 79, 98, and 41 to reach the target number 97.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible combinations and operations:

1.  Try starting with the largest numbers:
    *   98 + 41 = 139. Need to subtract something to get to 97. 139 - 97 = 42. Can I make 42 from 38 and 79? No simple way.
    *   98 - 41 = 57. Need to add something to get to 97. 97 - 57 = 40. Can I make 40 from 38 and 79? No.
    *   98 * 41 is too large.
    *   98 / 41 is not an integer.

2.  Try combining other pairs:
    *   79 + 41 = 120. Need to subtract 23. Can I make 23 from 38 and 98? No.
    *   79 - 41 = 38. Now I have 38, 38, 98. Need to get 97.
        *   38 + 38 + 98 = 174 (too big)
        *   38 * 38 is too big.
        *   98 - 38 - 38 = 22 (not 97)
        *   98 + 38 - 38 = 98 (not 97)
    *   79 * 41 is too large.
    *   79 / 41 is not an integer.

3.  Try involving 38:
    *   38 + 79 = 117. Need to subtract 20. Can I make 20 from 98 and 41? 98 - 41 = 57. No.
    *   38 - 79 is negative.
    *   38 * 79 is too large.
    *   38 / 79 is not an integer.

4.  Let's try to get close to 97 with two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
    *   98 is close to 97. If I use 98, I need to get 1 from the remaining numbers (38, 79, 41).
        *   Can I make 1 from 38, 79, 41?
            *   79 - 38 - 41 = 0. Close, but not 1.
            *   (79 - 38) / 41 = 41 / 41 = 1. Yes!
        *   So, the expression could be 98 + (79 - 38) / 41.
        *   Let's check: 98 + (41) / 41 = 98 + 1 = 99. Not 97.

    *   Let's try 98 - 1. Can I make 1 from 38, 79, 41? Yes, (79 - 38) / 41 = 1.
        *   So, the expression could be 98 - ((79 - 38) / 41).
        *   Let's check: 98 - (41 / 41) = 98 - 1 = 97. This works!

Let's verify all numbers are used exactly once: 98, 79, 38, 41. Yes.
Let's verify operations: -, -, /, (). Yes.

Let's try another approach to be sure.
Maybe multiplication is involved in a different way.
Target is 97.
Numbers are 38, 79, 98, 41.

What if I try to make a number close to 97 using multiplication?
*   38 * 2 = 76 (need 21 more from 79, 98, 41)
*   41 * 2 = 82 (need 15 more from 38, 79, 98)
*   38 * 3 = 114 (too big)

Let's reconsider the expression 98 - ((79 - 38) / 41).
This uses 98, 79, 38, 41.
Operations are -, -, /.
Result is 97.

Let's try to see if there are other possibilities.
What if we try to make 97 directly?
*   79 + 38 = 117. Need to subtract 20. Can I make 20 from 98 and 41? No.
*   79 + 41 = 120. Need to subtract 23. Can I make 23 from 38 and 98? No.
*   98 + 41 = 139. Need to subtract 42. Can I make 42 from 38 and 79? No.
*   98 + 38 = 136. Need to subtract 39. Can I make 39 from 79 and 41? 79 - 41 = 38. No.

Let's try subtraction first.
*   79 - 38 = 41. Now we have 41, 41, 98. Target 97.
    *   98 - 41 + 41 = 98.
    *   98 + 41 - 41 = 98.
    *   41 + 41 + 98 = 180.
    *   98 - (41/41) = 98 - 1 = 97. This is the same solution as before, just written differently. (79-38) is 41. So 98 - (41/41) = 97.

Let's try another combination for 1.
Can I make 1 from 38, 79, 41 in another way?
*   (79+41)/? No.
*   (98-79)/? No.
*   (98-41)/? No.
*   (79-41)/? No.
*   (41-38)/? No.

It seems the combination (79 - 38) / 41 = 1 is the most straightforward way to get 1.

Let's try to make 97 using multiplication and addition/subtraction.
Numbers: 38, 79, 98, 41. Target: 97.

Consider 38 * X.
If X = 2, 76. Need 21 from 79, 98, 41.
    *   98 - 79 = 19. Not 21.
    *   79 - 41 = 38.
    *   98 - 41 = 57.
    *   (98 - 79) + 41 = 19 + 41 = 60.
    *   (79 - 41) + 98 = 38 + 98 = 136.
    *   (98 - 41) - 79 = 57 - 79 (negative).
    *   (79 + 41) - 98 = 120 - 98 = 22. Close to 21.

Consider 41 * X.
If X = 2, 82. Need 15 from 38, 79, 98.
    *   79 - 38 = 41.
    *   98 - 79 = 19.
    *   98 - 38 = 60.
    *   (79 - 38) - 98 (negative).
    *   (98 - 79) - 38 = 19 - 38 (negative).
    *   (98 - 38) - 79 = 60 - 79 (negative).
    *   (79 + 38) - 98 = 117 - 98 = 19. Close to 15.

The user wants an arithmetic expression using the numbers [90, 65, 42, 56] exactly once to reach the target value of 57.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining the numbers.
Target: 57

Possible combinations and approaches:

1.  **Start with the largest number (90) and try to reduce it.**
    *   90 - ? = 57 => ? = 33. Can we make 33 from [65, 42, 56]?
        *   65 - 42 = 23 (not 33)

        *   (42 + 56) - 65 = 98 - 65 = 33. Found it!
        So, 90 - ( (42 + 56) - 65 ) = 90 - (98 - 65) = 90 - 33 = 57.

The user wants a mathematical equation using the numbers 3, 29, and 56 to equal 82.
I need to use each number exactly once and can use +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations:
1.  (56 + 29) + 3 = 85 + 3 = 88 (Too high)
2.  (56 + 29) - 3 = 85 - 3 = 82 (This works!)
3.  (56 - 29) + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30 (Too low)
4.  (56 - 29) - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24 (Too low)
5.  (56 * 3) + 29 = 168 + 29 = 197 (Too high)
6.  (56 * 3) - 29 = 168 - 29 = 139 (Too high)
7.  (29 * 3) + 56 = 87 + 56 = 143 (Too high)
8.  (29 * 3) - 56 = 87 - 56 = 31 (Too low)
9.  56 + (29 * 3) = 56 + 87 = 143 (Too high)
10. 56 - (29 * 3) = 56 - 87 = -31 (Too low)
11. 29 + (56 * 3) = 29 + 168 = 197 (Too high)
12. 29 - (56 * 3) = 29 - 168 = -139 (Too low)
13. 3 + (56 + 29) = 3 + 85 = 88 (Too high)
14. 3 - (56 + 29) = 3 - 85 = -82 (Close, but negative)
15. 3 + (56 - 29) = 3 + 27 = 30 (Too low)
16. 3 - (56 - 29) = 3 - 27 = -24 (Too low)
17. 3 * (56 + 29) = 3 * 85 = 255 (Too high)
18. 3 * (56 - 29) = 3 * 27 = 81 (Close, but not 82)
19. 3 + 56 + 29 = 88 (Too high)
20. 3 + 56 - 29 = 30 (Too low)
21. 3 - 56 + 29 = -24 (Too low)
22. 3 - 56 - 29 = -82 (Close, but negative)
23. 56 + 3 + 29 = 88 (Too high)

25. 56 - 3 + 29 = 53 + 29 = 82 (This also works!)
26. 56 - 3 - 29 = 53 - 29 = 24 (Too low)

28. 29 + 3 - 56 = -24 (Too low)
29. 29 - 3 + 56 = 26 + 56 = 82 (This also works!)
30. 29 - 3 - 56 = 26 - 56 = -30 (Too low)

I found three valid equations:
(56 + 29) - 3 = 82
56 - 3 + 29 = 82
29 - 3 + 56 = 82

I will pick one of them.

<answer>56 - 3 + 29 = 82</answer>",1.0,
5027,1564,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 24, 30, and 88 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 82.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (88):**
    *   88 - ? = 82. This means ? = 6. Can we get 6 from 24 and 30?
        *   30 - 24 = 6. Yes!
        *   So, 88 - (30 - 24) = 88 - 6 = 82. This works.

2.  **Check other combinations just to be sure or if the first one didn't work:**
    *   88 + 30 = 118. 118 - 24 = 94 (too high). 118 / 24 (not an integer).
    *   88 + 24 = 112. 112 - 30 = 82. This also works!
        *   So, 88 + 24 - 30 = 82.

    *   88 * 30 (too large).
    *   88 * 24 (too large).
    *   88 / 24 (not an integer).
    *   88 / 30 (not an integer).

    *   30 * 24 (too large).
    *   30 + 24 = 54. 88 - 54 = 34 (not 82). 88 + 54 (too large). 88 / 54 (not integer).
    *   30 - 24 = 6. 88 - 6 = 82. (Already found). 88 + 6 = 94. 88 * 6 (too large). 88 / 6 (not integer).

    *   24 - 30 = -6. 88 - (-6) = 94. 88 + (-6) = 82. (Already found).

The two valid equations are:
1.  88 - (30 - 24) = 82
2.  88 + 24 - 30 = 82

The user asked for ""an equation"", so either is fine. The second one is simpler. I will provide the simpler one.

1816,1851,"<think>The user wants me to construct an equation using the numbers 27, 28, and 71 to arrive at the result 71. I can only use the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Each number must be used exactly once.</think>
<think>The target number is 71. I have the numbers 27, 28, and 71. Since 71 is one of the numbers, a simple approach would be to have an expression that evaluates to 0 and add it to 71, or have an expression that evaluates to 71 and add 0 to it, or have an expression that evaluates to 1 and multiply it by 71, etc.</think>
<think>Let's consider the numbers 27 and 28. What can I do with them to get a useful result?</think>
<think>
Possibility 1: Combine 27 and 28 to get 0.
27 - 28 = -1 (Not 0)
28 - 27 = 1 (Not 0)
27 + 28 = 55 (Not 0)
27 * 28 = 756 (Not 0)
27 / 28 (Not an integer, unlikely to be useful for getting 0 easily)
28 / 27 (Not an integer, unlikely to be useful for getting 0 easily)
So, getting 0 from 27 and 28 directly seems difficult with basic operations.

Possibility 2: Combine 27 and 28 to get 1.
28 - 27 = 1. This is promising!
If I can get 1 from 27 and 28, I can then multiply 71 by this result.
The equation would look like: 71 * (28 - 27).
Let's check:
Numbers used: 71, 28, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations used: *, -. Allowed.
Result: 71 * (1) = 71. This works!

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

Possibility 3: Combine 27 and 28 to get a number that, when combined with 71, results in 71.
For example, if I can make 27 and 28 combine to 0, then 71 + 0 = 71.
As seen in Possibility 1, getting 0 from 27 and 28 is not straightforward.

What if I use 71 in a subtraction?
If I have X - 71 = 71, then X must be 142. Can I make 142 from 27 and 28?
27 + 28 = 55 (No)
27 * 28 = 756 (No)
This path doesn't seem easy.

What if I have 71 - X = 71? Then X must be 0. Can I make 0 from 27 and 28?
Again, as seen in Possibility 1, this is not straightforward.

What if I use 71 in a division?
If I have X / 71 = 71, then X must be 71 * 71 = 4941. Can I make 4941 from 27 and 28? Highly unlikely.
If I have 71 / X = 71, then X must be 1. Can I make 1 from 27 and 28? Yes, 28 - 27 = 1.
So, the equation would be 71 / (28 - 27).
Let's check:
Numbers used: 71, 28, 27. All used exactly once.
Operations used: /, -. Allowed.
Result: 71 / (1) = 71. This also works!

What if I use 71 in an addition?
If I have X + 71 = 71, then X must be 0. Can I make 0 from 27 and 28? Not easily.
If I have 71 + X = 71, then X must be 0. Can I make 0 from 27 and 28? Not easily.

Let's consider using 27 or 28 with 71 first.
Example: 27 + (something with 28 and 71) = 71.
This means (something with 28 and 71) must equal 71 - 27 = 44.
Can I make 44 from 28 and 71?
71 - 28 = 43 (Close, but not 44)
71 + 28 = 99
71 * 28 (Too large)
71 / 28 (Not integer)
28 / 71 (Not integer)
This path doesn't seem to work.

Example: 28 + (something with 27 and 71) = 71.
This means (something with 27 and 71) must equal 71 - 28 = 43.
Can I make 43 from 27 and 71?
71 - 27 = 44 (Close, but not 43)
71 + 27 = 98
71 * 27 (Too large)
71 / 27 (Not integer)
27 / 71 (Not integer)
This path doesn't seem to work.

Example: 27 * (something with 28 and 71) = 71.
This means (something with 28 and 71) must equal 71 / 27. Not an integer, so unlikely to be useful.

Example: 28 * (something with 27 and 71) = 71.
This means (something with 27 and 71) must equal 71 / 28. Not an integer, so unlikely to be useful.

Example: 71 * (something with 27 and 28) = 71.
This means (something with 27 and 28) must equal 71 / 71 = 1.
Can I make 1 from 27 and 28? Yes, 28 - 27 = 1.
So, 71 * (28 - 27) = 71. This is the first solution I found.

Example: 71 / (something with 27 and 28) = 71.
This means (something with 27 and 28) must equal 71 / 71 = 1.
Can I make 1 from 27 and 28? Yes, 28 - 27 = 1.
So, 71 / (28 - 27) = 71. This is the second solution I found.

Let's consider using all three numbers in a more complex way.
What if I try to make 0 from 27 and 28 and then add it to 71?
(27 - 27) + 28 = 28 (Doesn't use 71)
(28 - 28) + 27 = 27 (Doesn't use 71)
This approach requires using each number only once.

Let's go back to the successful ones:
1. 71 * (28 - 27) = 71
2. 71 / (28 - 27) = 71

Both are valid. The prompt asks for ""the ultimate equation"". I will present one of them. The multiplication one feels slightly more direct.

Let's double check the requirements:
- Use numbers [27 28 71]: Yes, all used.
- Result is 71: Yes.
- Only fundamental arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /): Yes.
- Each number incorporated exactly one time: Yes.

I will choose the multiplication version.
Equation: 71 * (28 - 27)
Step 1: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses. 28 - 27 = 1.
Step 2: Multiply the result by 71. 71 * 1 = 71.
The equation is correct.

<answer>71 * (28 - 27) = 71</answer>",1.0,
3768,386,"<think>The target number is 30. The available numbers are 33, 3, and 57. I need to use each number exactly once with standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to reach 30.

Let's list the numbers: 33, 3, 57.

Possible combinations of two numbers and an operator:
1. 33 + 3 = 36
2. 33 - 3 = 30
3. 33 * 3 = 99
4. 33 / 3 = 11
5. 33 + 57 = 90
6. 33 - 57 = -24
7. 33 * 57 = 1881
8. 33 / 57 (not a whole number, unlikely to be useful unless combined with other operations to cancel out decimals)
9. 3 + 57 = 60
10. 3 - 57 = -54
11. 3 * 57 = 171
12. 3 / 57 (not a whole number)
13. 57 + 3 = 60
14. 57 - 3 = 54
15. 57 * 3 = 171
16. 57 / 3 = 19

Now, let's try to incorporate the third number.

Case 1: Start with 33 + 3 = 36. The remaining number is 57.
   - 36 + 57 = 93 (not 30)
   - 36 - 57 = -21 (not 30)
   - 57 - 36 = 21 (not 30)
   - 36 * 57 (too large)
   - 36 / 57 (not a whole number)
   - 57 / 36 (not a whole number)

Case 2: Start with 33 - 3 = 30. The remaining number is 57.
   - We have 30 and 57. We need to combine them to get 30.
   - 30 + 57 = 87 (not 30)
   - 30 - 57 = -27 (not 30)
   - 57 - 30 = 27 (not 30)
   - 30 * 57 (too large)
   - 30 / 57 (not a whole number)
   - 57 / 30 (not a whole number)
   This path seems promising because 33 - 3 already gives 30. Can we use 57 in a way that doesn't change the result?
   - If we have (33 - 3) and then add or subtract something involving 57 that results in 0, or multiply/divide by something that results in 1.
   - (33 - 3) + (57 - 57) = 30 + 0 = 30. This uses 57 twice, which is not allowed.
   - (33 - 3) * (57 / 57) = 30 * 1 = 30. This uses 57 twice, not allowed.
   - What if 57 is part of the initial calculation?
   - Let's re-evaluate 33 - 3 = 30. We have 57 left.
   - Can we do something like (33 - 3) * (something with 57)? No, because we need to use 57 itself.
   - Can we do something like (33 - 3) + (something with 57)? No, we need to use 57.
   - What if 57 is used in a way that it cancels out or becomes 0 or 1 when combined with the result of 33 and 3?
   - Consider the expression structure: (A op B) op C or A op (B op C).
   - Let's try (33 - 3) = 30. We have 57. We need to combine 30 and 57 to get 30. This is not possible directly.

Let's rethink. The numbers are 33, 3, 57. Target is 30.

Try combinations involving 57 first.
Case 3: Start with 57 / 3 = 19. Remaining number is 33.
   - 19 + 33 = 52 (not 30)
   - 19 - 33 = -14 (not 30)
   - 33 - 19 = 14 (not 30)
   - 19 * 33 (too large)

Case 4: Start with 57 - 3 = 54. Remaining number is 33.
   - 54 + 33 = 87 (not 30)
   - 54 - 33 = 21 (not 30)
   - 33 - 54 = -21 (not 30)
   - 54 * 33 (too large)

Case 5: Start with 57 + 3 = 60. Remaining number is 33.
   - 60 + 33 = 93 (not 30)
   - 60 - 33 = 27 (not 30)
   - 33 - 60 = -27 (not 30)
   - 60 * 33 (too large)

Let's consider the structure where one number is used to modify another before combining with the third.
Example: (33 / 3) * 57 = 11 * 57 = 627 (too large)
Example: (33 * 3) - 57 = 99 - 57 = 42 (not 30)
Example: (33 * 3) + 57 = 99 + 57 = 156 (not 30)
Example: 57 - (33 / 3) = 57 - 11 = 46 (not 30)
Example: 57 + (33 / 3) = 57 + 11 = 68 (not 30)
Example: 33 + (57 / 3) = 33 + 19 = 52 (not 30)
Example: 33 - (57 / 3) = 33 - 19 = 14 (not 30)
Example: (57 - 33) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8 (not 30)
Example: (57 + 33) / 3 = 90 / 3 = 30. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 57, 33, 3. Each used once.
Operators used: -, +, /. Standard operators.
Equation: (57 + 33) / 3
Calculation:
1. 57 + 33 = 90
2. 90 / 3 = 30

This matches the target.

Let's try another structure just to be sure.
Example: 3 * (57 - 33) = 3 * 24 = 72 (not 30)
Example: 3 * (57 + 33) = 3 * 90 = 270 (not 30)
Example: 33 * (57 / 3) = 33 * 19 = 627 (not 30)
Example: 33 / (57 - 3) = 33 / 54 (not whole)
Example: 33 / (57 + 3) = 33 / 60 (not whole)

The solution (57 + 33) / 3 = 30 seems to be the only one.
Let's consider the order of operations. Parentheses are allowed implicitly by the structure of the expression.
The expression (57 + 33) / 3 implies that the addition is done first, then the division.

Let's check if any other combination works.
We already saw 33 - 3 = 30. We have 57 left.
Can we do 33 - 3 + 57? No, that's 87.
Can we do 33 - 3 - 57? No, that's -27.

36 / 99 * 75 (fraction)

Let's consider the possibility of using parentheses differently.
(75 + 99) - 36 = 174 - 36 = 138
(75 - 99) + 36 = -24 + 36 = 12
(99 - 75) + 36 = 24 + 36 = 60. This is the same solution as before, just written with parentheses.

Let's try to get 60 by dividing one number by another and then operating with the third.
75 / 36 = 2.083...
99 / 36 = 2.75
36 / 75 = 0.48
36 / 99 = 0.3636...
75 / 99 = 0.7575...
99 / 75 = 1.32

Let's try to get 60 by multiplying two numbers and then dividing by the third.
(75 * 99) / 36 = 7425 / 36 (not integer)
(75 * 36) / 99 = 2700 / 99 (not integer)
(99 * 36) / 75 = 3564 / 75 (not integer)

Let's try to get 60 by dividing two numbers and then multiplying by the third.
(75 / 36) * 99 (fraction)
(75 / 99) * 36 (fraction)
(99 / 36) * 75 = 2.75 * 75 = 206.25
(99 / 75) * 36 = 1.32 * 36 = 47.52
(36 / 75) * 99 (fraction)
(36 / 99) * 75 (fraction)

Let's consider the solution 99 - 75 + 36 = 60.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there's a solution involving multiplication or division that results in an integer.
If we can get a number that divides evenly into another.
36 is divisible by 6, 9, 12, 18.
75 is divisible by 3, 5, 15, 25.
99 is divisible by 3, 9, 11, 33.

Let's try to make 60 using multiplication.
If we can make 60 by multiplying two numbers, e.g., 6 * 10, 5 * 12, 4 * 15, 3 * 20, 2 * 30.

Let's list the numbers: [81, 62, 92]
Target: 51

Possible combinations and operations:

1.  Try starting with the largest number, 92.
    *   92 - ? = 51.  ? = 92 - 51 = 41. Can we make 41 from 81 and 62?
        *   81 + 62 = 143 (No)

        *   81 * 62 = large (No)
        *   81 / 62 = not integer (No)
        *   62 / 81 = not integer (No)
    *   92 + ? = 51. ? = 51 - 92 = -41. Can we make -41 from 81 and 62?

        *   62 - 81 = -19 (No)
        *   (81 - 62) * -1 = -19 (No)
        *   (62 - 81) * -1 = 19 (No)
    *   92 * ? = 51. ? = 51/92 (Not integer, unlikely)
    *   92 / ? = 51. ? = 92/51 (Not integer, unlikely)

2.  Try starting with 81.
    *   81 - ? = 51. ? = 81 - 51 = 30. Can we make 30 from 62 and 92?
        *   92 - 62 = 30. Yes!
        *   So, 81 - (92 - 62) = 81 - 30 = 51.
        *   Let's check: Numbers used: 81, 92, 62 (all used exactly once). Operations: -, -. Evaluates to 51. This looks like a valid solution.

3.  Let's try other combinations to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.
    *   81 + ? = 51. ? = 51 - 81 = -30. Can we make -30 from 62 and 92?
        *   62 - 92 = -30. Yes!
        *   So, 81 + (62 - 92) = 81 + (-30) = 51.
        *   Let's check: Numbers used: 81, 62, 92 (all used exactly once). Operations: +, -. Evaluates to 51. This is also a valid solution.

4.  Try starting with 62.

        *   92 - 81 = 11. Yes!
        *   So, 62 - (92 - 81) = 62 - 11 = 51.
        *   Let's check: Numbers used: 62, 92, 81 (all used exactly once). Operations: -, -. Evaluates to 51. This is also a valid solution.

We have found three valid solutions:

2.  81 + (62 - 92) = 51
3.  62 - (92 - 81) = 51

5004,173,"<think>I need to use the numbers 69, 34, 55, and 81 to reach the target of 77.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combining the numbers.
The target is 77. The numbers are 69, 34, 55, 81.

Possible combinations:
Try to get close to 77 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.
69 + 34 = 103. 103 - 55 = 48. 48 + 81 = 129. Too high.
69 - 34 = 35. 35 + 55 = 90. 90 - 81 = 9. Too low.
69 + 55 = 124. 124 - 34 = 90. 90 - 81 = 9. Too low.
69 - 55 = 14. 14 + 34 = 48. 48 + 81 = 129. Too high.
69 + 81 = 150. 150 - 34 = 116. 116 - 55 = 61. Too low.
69 - 81 = -12. Not helpful.

Let's try multiplication.
69 * 34 is too large.
Maybe division is involved.

Let's try to get a number close to 77 by combining some numbers.
81 - 69 = 12.
55 - 34 = 21.
12 + 21 = 33. Not 77.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe one of the numbers is used in a way that it reduces the result significantly.
For example, if we subtract a large number.
81 - 55 = 26.
69 + 34 = 103.
103 - 26 = 77.
This uses 81, 55, 69, 34.
The equation would be (69 + 34) - (81 - 55).
Let's check:
69 + 34 = 103
81 - 55 = 26
103 - 26 = 77.
This works.

Let's try another way to be sure.
What if we use division?
81 / 3 = 27. We don't have 3.
55 / 5 = 11. We don't have 5.

Let's re-examine the previous successful attempt: (69 + 34) - (81 - 55) = 77.
This uses all numbers: 69, 34, 81, 55.
It uses addition and subtraction.
The order of operations is clear with parentheses.

Let's try to rearrange the terms.
69 + 34 - 81 + 55 = 103 - 81 + 55 = 22 + 55 = 77.
This is a valid equation as well.
69 + 34 - 81 + 55

Let's check if there are other possibilities.
Maybe multiplication is involved in a different way.
(81 - 69) * 5 = 12 * 5 = 60. We don't have 5.
(55 - 34) * 3 = 21 * 3 = 63. We don't have 3.

Let's go back to the addition/subtraction combinations.
We found 69 + 34 - 81 + 55 = 77.

Let's try to get 77 by starting with a number close to it.
81 - 4 = 77. We don't have 4.
69 + 8 = 77. We don't have 8.
55 + 22 = 77. We don't have 22.

Let's try to make 77 from two pairs.
Pair 1: 69, 34. Pair 2: 55, 81.
69 + 34 = 103. 81 - 55 = 26. 103 - 26 = 77. This is (69 + 34) - (81 - 55).
69 - 34 = 35. 81 - 55 = 26. 35 + 26 = 61.
69 + 34 = 103. 55 - 81 = -26. 103 - (-26) = 129.

Pair 1: 69, 55. Pair 2: 34, 81.
69 + 55 = 124. 81 - 34 = 47. 124 - 47 = 77.
This is (69 + 55) - (81 - 34).
Let's check:
69 + 55 = 124
81 - 34 = 47
124 - 47 = 77.
This also works.

So we have two valid solutions:
1. (69 + 34) - (81 - 55)
2. (69 + 55) - (81 - 34)

Let's check if there's a simpler one.
69 + 34 - 81 + 55 = 77. This is simpler.

Let's try to use multiplication.
Maybe one of the numbers is a multiplier.
If 34 is a multiplier: 34 * x. Not likely to get 77.
If 55 is a multiplier: 55 * x. Not likely.
If 81 is a multiplier: 81 * x. Not likely.
If 69 is a multiplier: 69 * x. Not likely.

What if we divide first?
81 / 3 = 27. We don't have 3.
55 / 5 = 11. We don't have 5.
34 / 2 = 17. We don't have 2.
69 / 3 = 23. We don't have 3.

Let's consider the solution 69 + 34 - 81 + 55 = 77.
This is a valid equation using all numbers exactly once.

Let's consider the solution (69 + 55) - (81 - 34) = 77.
This is also valid.

The problem asks for ""an equation"". Either one is fine.
The simpler one is 69 + 34 - 81 + 55.

Let's try to see if we can get 77 using multiplication and division.
(81 / 3) * x. No 3.
(55 / 5) * x. No 5.

Let's try to get a number close to 77 and add/subtract the rest.
81 - 69 = 12.
55 - 34 = 21.
12 + 21 = 33.

Let's try to get a number that, when multiplied by one of the numbers, gets close to 77.
If we multiply by 1, it's just the number itself.
If we multiply by 2, we need 38.5.
If we multiply by 3, we need 25.66.

Let's go back to the addition/subtraction.
69 + 34 - 81 + 55 = 77.
This is a good candidate.

Let's try to see if we can get 77 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others.
69 * 1 = 69. Then we need 8 from 34, 55, 81. Not possible.
34 * 1 = 34. Then we need 43 from 69, 55, 81. Not possible.
55 * 1 = 55. Then we need 22 from 69, 34, 81. Not possible.
81 * 1 = 81. Then we need -4 from 69, 34, 55. Not possible.

The goal is to construct a single equation that evaluates to 65 using the numbers [83, 79, 69] exactly once each, with only the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 83, N2 = 79, N3 = 69.
We need to combine these three numbers using the four allowed operations to get 65.
There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers.
For each permutation, there are 4^(3-1) = 4^2 = 16 possible combinations of operations if we consider order of operations. However, we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations.

Let's try different combinations systematically.

Let's try to construct 27 from scratch.
We have 29, 89, 48, 12.

What if we use subtraction to get a smaller number, then multiply?
(48 - 29) = 19. Remaining: [89, 12].
19 * 12 + 89 (too big)
19 + 89 - 12 = 96
19 - 89 + 12 = -58

What if we use addition to get a larger number, then subtract?
(29 + 12) = 41. Remaining: [89, 48].
41 + 89 - 48 = 82
41 - 89 + 48 = 0

(29 + 48) = 77. Remaining: [89, 12].
77 + 89 - 12 = 154
77 - 89 + 12 = 0

(29 + 89) = 118. Remaining: [48, 12].
118 + 48 - 12 = 154
118 - 48 + 12 = 82

(48 + 12) = 60. Remaining: [29, 89].
60 + 29 - 89 = 0
60 - 29 + 89 = 120

(48 + 89) = 137. Remaining: [29, 12].
137 + 29 - 12 = 154
137 - 29 + 12 = 120

(89 + 12) = 101. Remaining: [29, 48].
101 + 29 - 48 = 82
101 - 29 + 48 = 120

Let's try multiplication with one of the smaller numbers.
Maybe something like (A + B) * C / D = 27.
Or (A - B) * C / D = 27.

Let's try to get a number that divides nicely.
Consider 48.
If we divide 48 by something, we need the result to be part of getting 27.
48 / 12 = 4. Remaining: [29, 89].
Can we get 23 from 29 and 89? 89 - 29 = 60. 29 - 89 = -60. 89 + 29 = 118. No.
So 4 + (89 - 29) = 64. 4 + (29 - 89) = -56.

Let's try to get a number that, when multiplied by one of the numbers, gets close to 27.
For example, if we multiply by 12, we need something around 2.25.
If we multiply by 29, we need something around 0.93.
If we multiply by 48, we need something around ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

Let's list the numbers: {69, 34, 55, 81}
Target result: 77

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to get 77.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are relatively large, so multiplication might lead to results far from 77 quickly. Division might be useful to reduce numbers.

Possible pairings and operations:
(69 + 34) = 103
(69 - 34) = 35

(55 - 81) = -26
(55 * 81) = 4455
(55 / 81) = ~0.68

Let's try to get close to 77.
Maybe a large number minus something, or a smaller number plus something.

Consider 81. 81 - 4 = 77. Can I make 4 from {69, 34, 55}?
(69 - 55) = 14. Not 4.
(55 - 34) = 21. Not 4.
(69 / ?) - ? = 4?

Consider 69. 69 + 8 = 77. Can I make 8 from {34, 55, 81}?
(81 - 55) = 26. Not 8.
(55 - 34) = 21. Not 8.
(81 / ?) + ? = 8?

Consider 55. 55 + 22 = 77. Can I make 22 from {69, 34, 81}?
(81 - 69) = 12. Not 22.
(69 - 34) = 35. Not 22.

(81 - 69) = 12. Not 43.

Let's try division to reduce numbers.
Maybe something like (A / B) * C + D = 77 or A - (B / C) * D = 77.

Let's try to get a number close to 77 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the other two.
(34 * ?)
(55 * ?)
(69 * ?)
(81 * ?)

What if we use division to get a small integer?
(55 / ?)
(34 / ?)
(69 / ?)
(81 / ?)

Let's try to make a number that, when added to or subtracted from another number, gets us closer.
Numbers: {69, 34, 55, 81} Target: 77

Try combining two numbers first:
69 + 34 = 103. Remaining: {55, 81}. 103 - 55 = 48. 103 - 81 = 22. 103 + 55 = 158. 103 + 81 = 184.
69 - 34 = 35. Remaining: {55, 81}. 35 + 55 = 90. 35 + 81 = 116. 35 - 55 = -20. 35 - 81 = -46. 55 - 35 = 20. 81 - 35 = 46.
34 - 69 = -35.
69 * 34 = 2346. Too big.
69 / 34 = ~2.03.

Let's try to get a number that can be divided.
Maybe (81 + 55) / ? = ?
(81 + 55) = 136.
136 / 34 = 4. Remaining: {69}. 4 + 69 = 73. Close. 69 - 4 = 65.
So, (81 + 55) / 34 + 69 = 73. Not 77.
How about 69 - ((81 + 55) / 34) = 69 - 4 = 65.

Let's try another division.
(69 + 55) = 124.
124 / 34 is not an integer.
124 / 81 is not an integer.

(81 + 34) = 115.
115 / 55 is not an integer.
115 / 69 is not an integer.

(69 + 34) = 103.
103 / 55 is not an integer.
103 / 81 is not an integer.

What about subtraction first?
(81 - 55) = 26. Remaining: {69, 34}.
26 + 69 = 95. 95 - 34 = 61.
26 + 34 = 60. 60 + 69 = 129.
69 - 26 = 43. 43 + 34 = 77. Found one!
The numbers used are 81, 55, 69, 34.
The equation is (81 - 55) = 26. Then 69 - 26 = 43. Then 43 + 34 = 77.
So, 69 - (81 - 55) + 34 = 77.
Let's check: 69 - (26) + 34 = 69 - 26 + 34 = 43 + 34 = 77.
This uses all numbers {69, 34, 55, 81} exactly once.
Operations are -, -, +.

Let's try to find another one just in case.
(81 - 34) = 47. Remaining: {69, 55}.
47 + 69 = 116. 116 - 55 = 61.
47 + 55 = 102. 102 - 69 = 33.
69 - 47 = 22. 22 + 55 = 77. Found another one!
The numbers used are 81, 34, 69, 55.
The equation is (81 - 34) = 47. Then 69 - 47 = 22. Then 22 + 55 = 77.
So, 69 - (81 - 34) + 55 = 77.

    *   (25 + 2) * ? = 71 => 27 * ? = 71. No integer solution.
    *   (25 * 2) + ? = 71 => 50 + ? = 71 => ? = 21. We need to use 92. Can we make 21 from 92? No.
    *   (25 * 2) - ? = 71 => 50 - ? = 71 => ? = 50 - 71 = -21. We need to use 92. Can we make -21 from 92? No.
    *   (25 / 2) ... not integer.
    *   (2 * 25) + 92 = 50 + 92 = 142 (No)
    *   (2 * 25) - 92 = 50 - 92 = -42 (No)
    *   92 - (2 * 25) = 92 - 50 = 42 (No)

The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers 30, 5, and 5 exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /. The target sum is 11.

Let's list the numbers: [30, 5, 5].
The target is 11.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations.
Possible combinations of two numbers first:
1. 30 and 5:
   - 30 + 5 = 35
   - 30 - 5 = 25
   - 30 * 5 = 150
   - 30 / 5 = 6

2. 5 and 5:

   - 5 - 5 = 0
   - 5 * 5 = 25
   - 5 / 5 = 1

Now, let's try to combine the result of the first operation with the remaining number to get 11.

Case 1: Using 30 and 5 first.
   - Result 35, remaining number 5.
     - 35 + 5 = 40 (No)
     - 35 - 5 = 30 (No)
     - 35 * 5 = 175 (No)
     - 35 / 5 = 7 (No)
   - Result 25, remaining number 5.
     - 25 + 5 = 30 (No)
     - 25 - 5 = 20 (No)
     - 25 * 5 = 125 (No)
     - 25 / 5 = 5 (No)
   - Result 150, remaining number 5.
     - 150 + 5 = 155 (No)
     - 150 - 5 = 145 (No)
     - 150 * 5 = 750 (No)
     - 150 / 5 = 30 (No)
   - Result 6, remaining number 5.
     - 6 + 5 = 11 (Yes!)
     - This combination is (30 / 5) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.
     - Let's check: uses 30, 5, 5 exactly once. Operations are / and +. Result is 11. This looks correct.

Case 2: Using 5 and 5 first.
   - Result 10, remaining number 30.
     - 10 + 30 = 40 (No)
     - 10 - 30 = -20 (No)
     - 10 * 30 = 300 (No)
     - 30 / 10 = 3 (No)
     - 10 / 30 = 1/3 (No)
   - Result 0, remaining number 30.
     - 0 + 30 = 30 (No)
     - 0 - 30 = -30 (No)
     - 0 * 30 = 0 (No)
     - 30 / 0 is undefined.
   - Result 25, remaining number 30.
     - 25 + 30 = 55 (No)
     - 25 - 30 = -5 (No)
     - 25 * 30 = 750 (No)
     - 30 / 25 = 6/5 (No)
     - 25 / 30 = 5/6 (No)
   - Result 1, remaining number 30.
     - 1 + 30 = 31 (No)
     - 1 - 30 = -29 (No)
     - 1 * 30 = 30 (No)
     - 30 / 1 = 30 (No)
     - 1 / 30 (No)

Let's re-evaluate the successful combination: (30 / 5) + 5.
Numbers used: 30, 5, 5. All used exactly once.
Operations used: /, +. Basic operations.
Calculation: 30 / 5 = 6. Then 6 + 5 = 11.
The result is 11.

Let's consider other parenthesizations for (30 / 5) + 5.
If we write 30 / 5 + 5, standard order of operations would perform division first, then addition, which is what we want. So, parentheses are not strictly necessary for this specific order, but they clarify the steps.

Are there any other possibilities?
What if we start with 30 and one of the 5s, and then use the other 5?
Example: 30 - (5 * 5) = 30 - 25 = 5 (No)
Example: 30 + (5 / 5) = 30 + 1 = 31 (No)
Example: 30 - (5 / 5) = 30 - 1 = 29 (No)
Example: 30 * (5 / 5) = 30 * 1 = 30 (No)
Example: (30 - 5) + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30 (No)
Example: (30 + 5) - 5 = 35 - 5 = 30 (No)
Example: (30 * 5) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30 (No)
Example: (30 / 5) * 5 = 6 * 5 = 30 (No)

What if we use subtraction to get a smaller number from 30?
(30 - 5) = 25. Then use the other 5.
25 + 5 = 30 (No)
25 - 5 = 20 (No)

3991,1777,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 35, 41, and 49 exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to arrive at the target value of 55.

I need to explore different combinations and orders of operations.

Let's list the numbers: 35, 41, 49.
Target: 55.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try some initial combinations:

1.  **Addition/Subtraction focused:**
    *   35 + 41 + 49 = 125 (Too high)
    *   49 + 41 - 35 = 90 - 35 = 55. This looks promising! Let's check if this is a valid equation. Yes, it uses all numbers once and only basic operations.

Let's verify this:
49 + 41 = 90
90 - 35 = 55

This seems to be a direct and simple solution.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, although the first one found is often the intended one for these types of puzzles.

2.  **Involving Multiplication/Division:**
    *   Could division be involved? 49 / 7 = 7, but 7 is not in the list. 35 / 5 = 7. 41 is prime. Division seems less likely to yield a clean integer result with these numbers unless it's part of a larger expression that cancels out remainders.
    *   Let's try multiplication.
        *   35 * 41 ... this will be a very large number.
        *   35 * 49 ... also very large.
        *   41 * 49 ... also very large.
    *   What if multiplication is used to reduce a number or create a specific intermediate value?
        *   (41 - 35) * ? = 6 * ?
        *   (49 - 35) * ? = 14 * ?
        *   (49 - 41) * ? = 8 * ?
        *   (41 + 35) * ? = 76 * ?
        *   (49 + 35) * ? = 84 * ?
        *   (49 + 41) * ? = 90 * ?

    *   Let's try to get close to 55 using multiplication and then adjust.
        *   If we have 49, we need to add 6. Can we make 6 from 35 and 41? 41 - 35 = 6. So, 49 + (41 - 35) = 49 + 6 = 55. This is the same solution as before, just with parentheses.
        *   If we have 35, we need to add 20. Can we make 20 from 41 and 49? 49 - 41 = 8. 41 - 49 is negative. 49 + 41 = 90. No easy way to get 20.
        *   If we have 41, we need to add 14. Can we make 14 from 35 and 49? 49 - 35 = 14. So, 41 + (49 - 35) = 41 + 14 = 55. This is also the same solution.

    *   Let's consider division again.
        *   Could we divide a sum or difference?
        *   (41 + 49) / ? = 90 / ?
        *   (49 - 41) / ? = 8 / ?
        *   (41 - 35) / ? = 6 / ?
        *   (49 - 35) / ? = 14 / ?
        *   (49 + 35) / ? = 84 / ?
        *   (41 + 35) / ? = 76 / ?

        *   If we use 35, 41, 49, and want 55.
        *   What if we try to make a number that divides nicely?
        *   Consider 49. We need 55. Difference is 6. Can we make 6 from 35 and 41? Yes, 41 - 35 = 6. So, 49 + (41 - 35) = 55.
        *   Consider 35. We need 55. Difference is 20. Can we make 20 from 41 and 49? No obvious way.
        *   Consider 41. We need 55. Difference is 14. Can we make 14 from 35 and 49? Yes, 49 - 35 = 14. So, 41 + (49 - 35) = 55.

    *   Let's try a structure like (A * B) + C or (A + B) * C.
        *   (35 * 41) + 49 = large
        *   (35 + 41) * 49 = 76 * 49 = large
        *   (49 - 35) * 41 = 14 * 41 = 574 (Too high)
        *   (41 - 35) * 49 = 6 * 49 = 294 (Too high)

    *   What about division as the last step?
        *   (Something) / 35 = 55 => Something = 55 * 35 (large)
        *   (Something) / 41 = 55 => Something = 55 * 41 (large)
        *   (Something) / 49 = 55 => Something = 55 * 49 (large)

    *   What about division earlier?
        *   35 / ? ...
        *   41 / ? ...
        *   49 / ? ...

    *   Let's re-examine the first solution: 49 + 41 - 35 = 55.
        *   This uses 49, 41, 35.
        *   It uses +, -.
        *   It results in 55.
        *   Each number is used once.

    *   Let's try to write it in a different order to ensure no other simple solutions are missed.
        *   41 + 49 - 35 = 55 (Same as above)
        *   41 - 35 + 49 = 6 + 49 = 55 (Same solution)
        *   49 - 35 + 41 = 14 + 41 = 55 (Same solution)
        *   35 + 41 + 49 = 125
        *   35 + 49 + 41 = 125
        *   35 - 41 + 49 = -6 + 49 = 43 (Not 55)
        *   35 - 49 + 41 = -14 + 41 = 27 (Not 55)
        *   41 + 35 + 49 = 125
        *   41 + 49 + 35 = 125
        *   41 - 35 + 49 = 6 + 49 = 55 (Same solution)
        *   41 - 49 + 35 = -8 + 35 = 27 (Not 55)
        *   49 + 35 + 41 = 125
        *   49 + 41 + 35 = 125
        *   49 - 35 + 41 = 14 + 41 = 55 (Same solution)
        *   49 - 41 + 35 = 8 + 35 = 43 (Not 55)

    *   It seems the most straightforward solution is indeed 49 + 41 - 35.
    *   Let's consider if parentheses are implicitly allowed or if the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is assumed. The problem states ""fundamental arithmetic operations"", which implies standard order of operations.
    *   If we write 49 + 41 - 35, the operations are performed from left to right: (49 + 41) - 35 = 90 - 35 = 55.

<think>I need to use the numbers 65, 70, and 45 exactly once, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to reach the target number 90.

Let's explore combinations.

First, consider the largest numbers, 70 and 65.
If I add them: 70 + 65 = 135. Then I have 45 left. 135 - 45 = 90. This looks promising.
Let's check if this uses all numbers exactly once and only basic operations.
The expression is (70 + 65) - 45.
Numbers used: 70, 65, 45 (all used once).
Operations used: +, - (basic operations).
Result: 135 - 45 = 90.

This solution works.

Let's try other combinations just to be thorough, though the first one seems correct.

What if I subtract 65 from 70? 70 - 65 = 5. Then I have 45 left.
5 * 45 = 225 (too large).
5 + 45 = 50 (too small).
45 / 5 = 9 (too small).

What if I subtract 45 from 70? 70 - 45 = 25. Then I have 65 left.
25 + 65 = 90. This also works!
The expression is (70 - 45) + 65.
Numbers used: 70, 45, 65 (all used once).
Operations used: -, + (basic operations).
Result: 25 + 65 = 90.

This is another valid solution. The problem asks for *an* equation, so either is fine. I'll present the first one I found.

Let's consider multiplication first.
65 * 70 is very large.
65 * 45 is very large.
70 * 45 is very large.

Division might be tricky as we need whole numbers or intermediate results that lead to 90.
70 / 65 is not a whole number.
70 / 45 is not a whole number.
65 / 45 is not a whole number.
45 / 65 is not a whole number.
45 / 70 is not a whole number.
65 / 70 is not a whole number.

What about dividing one number by another and then using the third?
For example, if we could get a factor of 90.
Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.

Can we make 45 using 65 and 70?
70 - 65 = 5. Not 45.
70 + 65 = 135. Not 45.

Can we make 10 using 65 and 70?
70 - 65 = 5. Not 10.

Can we make 15 using 65 and 70?
70 - 65 = 5. Not 15.

Can we make 18 using 65 and 70?
70 - 65 = 5. Not 18.

Can we make 30 using 65 and 70?
70 - 65 = 5. Not 30.

Let's go back to the successful ones.
Solution 1: (70 + 65) - 45 = 90
Solution 2: (70 - 45) + 65 = 90

Both are valid. I will output the first one.

4457,1933,"<think>The challenge is to create a single algebraic equation using the numbers 66, 50, 53, and 63 exactly once, along with the operators +, -, *, and /, to achieve a result of 97.

Let's list the numbers: {66, 50, 53, 63}.
The target value is 97.
Allowed operators: +, -, *, /.

I need to combine these four numbers using three operators. The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) will be crucial. Parentheses can be used to control the order of operations.

Let's try some initial combinations.

Attempt 1: Simple addition and subtraction.
66 + 50 + 53 + 63 = 232 (Too high)
66 + 50 + 53 - 63 = 106 (Close, but not 97)
66 + 50 - 53 + 63 = 126 (Too high)
66 - 50 + 53 + 63 = 132 (Too high)

Attempt 2: Introducing multiplication.
Multiplication usually increases the value significantly. I need to be careful.

Let's try multiplying two numbers and then combining with the others.
Possibilities for multiplication:
66 * 50 = 3300 (Way too high)
66 * 53 = 3498 (Way too high)
66 * 63 = 4158 (Way too high)
50 * 53 = 2650 (Way too high)
50 * 63 = 3150 (Way too high)
53 * 63 = 3359 (Way too high)

This suggests that if I use multiplication, it should probably involve smaller numbers or division to bring the value down. Or, multiplication might be the last operation, or applied to a result that is already close to the target.

Let's consider division. Division can reduce values.
Possible divisions:
66 / 50 (not an integer)
66 / 53 (not an integer)
66 / 63 (not an integer)
50 / 66 (not an integer)
50 / 53 (not an integer)
50 / 63 (not an integer)
53 / 66 (not an integer)
53 / 50 (not an integer)
53 / 63 (not an integer)
63 / 66 (not an integer)
63 / 50 (not an integer)
63 / 53 (not an integer)

This is problematic. If I need to use division, it must result in an integer or be part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.
Let's re-evaluate. The problem states ""algebraic equation"". This implies standard mathematical notation.

What if division is used to create a smaller number that is then used in multiplication or addition/subtraction?
For example, if I could get a small integer from division.
None of the direct divisions of two numbers from the set yield integers.

This means division might be used in a way that the numerator is a result of other operations, or the denominator is a result of other operations. Or, the division itself might not result in an integer, but the overall expression does. However, typically in these puzzles, integer results are preferred or implied. Let's assume for now that intermediate results can be non-integers if the final result is an integer.

Let's try to get close to 97.
Numbers: {66, 50, 53, 63}

Consider combinations that might yield numbers around 97.
Maybe a large number minus something?
66 + 50 = 116. 116 - 53 = 63. 63 + 63 = 126. (Used 63 twice, not allowed)
66 + 53 = 119. 119 - 50 = 69. 69 + 63 = 132.
66 + 63 = 129. 129 - 50 = 79. 79 + 53 = 132.
50 + 53 = 103. 103 - 66 = 37. 37 + 63 = 100. (Close!)
50 + 63 = 113. 113 - 66 = 47. 47 + 53 = 100. (Close!)
53 + 63 = 116. 116 - 66 = 50. 50 + 50 = 100. (Used 50 twice, not allowed)

Let's revisit 50 + 53 = 103.
We have 103, and the remaining numbers are 66 and 63. We need to get from 103 to 97 using 66 and 63.
103 - 66 = 37. Remaining is 63. 37 + 63 = 100. (Not 97)
103 - 63 = 40. Remaining is 66. 40 + 66 = 106. (Not 97)
103 + 66 = 169. Remaining is 63. 169 - 63 = 106. (Not 97)
103 + 63 = 166. Remaining is 66. 166 - 66 = 100. (Not 97)

Let's try multiplication again, but maybe with a smaller number.
What if we multiply by 1? Can we make 1 from division?
66/66 = 1 (uses 66 twice)
50/50 = 1 (uses 50 twice)
53/53 = 1 (uses 53 twice)
63/63 = 1 (uses 63 twice)
This is not helpful.

What if we multiply a number by a result of division?
Example: 50 * (66/?) - this doesn't seem to lead anywhere easily.

Let's try to construct expressions that evaluate to numbers that, when combined with the remaining numbers, give 97.

Consider the target 97.
It's an odd number.
Numbers: {66 (even), 50 (even), 53 (odd), 63 (odd)}.
Sum of all numbers: 66 + 50 + 53 + 63 = 232 (even).
To get an odd number (97) from an even sum (232), we need an odd number of subtractions of odd numbers, or an odd number of additions of odd numbers.
Or, if we use multiplication, an odd * odd = odd, odd * even = even, even * even = even.

Let's try to get a number close to 97 by combining two numbers, then use the other two.
66 + 50 = 116. Remaining: {53, 63}. Need to get 97 from 116, 53, 63.
116 - 53 = 63. 63 + 63 = 126. (Used 63 twice)

119 + 50 = 169. 169 - 63 = 106.
119 + 63 = 182. 182 - 50 = 132.

66 + 63 = 129. Remaining: {50, 53}. Need to get 97 from 129, 50, 53.

Let's try some combinations.

Target: 33

Numbers: 99, 49, 40, 23

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest number and try to reduce it.
2. Combine smaller numbers to get a value that helps reach 33.

Let's try combining 49 and 40.
49 - 40 = 9. Then I need to get 33 from 99, 23, and 9.
99 / 23 is not an integer.
99 + 23 = 122. 122 - 9 = 113. Not 33.
99 - 23 = 76. 76 - 9 = 67. Not 33.
23 - 9 = 14. 99 - 14 = 85. Not 33.
99 * 9 = 891. Too big.
99 / 9 = 11. 11 + 23 = 34. Close! 11 - 23 = -12.

Let's try combining 99 and 49.
99 - 49 = 50. Need 33 from 50, 40, 23.
50 - 40 = 10. Need 33 from 10, 23. 10 + 23 = 33. This works!
So, (99 - 49) - 40 + 23 = 50 - 40 + 23 = 10 + 23 = 33.
Let's check if all numbers are used: 99, 49, 40, 23. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, -, +. Yes.

Let's try another combination just to be sure.
What if I try to get a number close to 33 directly?
40 - 9 = 31 (using 40 and 9, where 9 is from 49-40 or 23-?)

99 - 49 = 50. 50 - 17 = 33. This also works!

96 - X = 84, so X = 12. Can I make 12 from 3, 24, and 52?
24 / 3 = 8. 52 - 8 = 44. No.
52 / ? No easy way to get 12.

Let's try combining 24 and 3 first.
24 * 3 = 72.
Can I get 84 from 96, 52, and 72?
96 - 52 = 44. 44 + 72 = 116. No.
96 + 52 = 148. 148 - 72 = 76. No.
52 - 96 is negative.

Let's try combining 96 and 3.
96 / 3 = 32.
Can I get 84 from 32, 24, and 52?
32 + 24 = 56. 56 + 52 = 108. No.
32 + 52 = 84. This looks promising!
So, (96 / 3) + 52 = 32 + 52 = 84.
I have used 96, 3, and 52. I still need to use 24.
This combination doesn't work because I haven't used 24.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe multiplication is involved to get a larger number and then adjust.
24 * 3 = 72.
Can I get 84 from 96, 52, and 72? No, we already tried this.

What if I use 24 and 52?
52 + 24 = 76.
Can I get 84 from 96, 3, and 76?
96 - 3 = 93. 93 - 76 = 17. No.
96 + 3 = 99. 99 - 76 = 23. No.

Let's try 52 - 24 = 28.
Can I get 84 from 96, 3, and 28?
96 - 3 = 93. 93 - 28 = 65. No.
96 + 3 = 99. 99 - 28 = 71. No.

Let's try 52 * 3 = 156.
Can I get 84 from 96, 24, and 156?
156 - 96 = 60. 60 + 24 = 84. This works!
The numbers used are 52, 3, 96, and 24. All used exactly once.
The operations are multiplication, subtraction, and addition.

The equation is (52 * 3) - 96 + 24.
Let's check:
52 * 3 = 156
156 - 96 = 60
60 + 24 = 84.

This is a valid solution.

The target number is 98.
The available numbers are 88, 24, and 34.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's try combinations:

1.  **Addition/Subtraction:**
    *   88 + 24 + 34 = 146 (Too high)
    *   88 + 24 - 34 = 78 (Too low)
    *   88 - 24 + 34 = 98 (This works!)
    *   88 - 24 - 34 = 30 (Too low)
    *   24 + 34 - 88 = -30 (Too low)
    *   24 - 34 + 88 = 78 (Too low)
    *   34 + 88 - 24 = 98 (This also works!)
    *   34 - 88 + 24 = -30 (Too low)

2.  **Multiplication/Division:**
    *   88 * 24 ... (will be very large)
    *   88 / 24 ... (not a whole number, likely not useful)
    *   24 / 88 ... (fraction)
    *   34 / 88 ... (fraction)
    *   88 * 34 ... (very large)
    *   24 * 34 ... (large)

Let's re-examine the successful addition/subtraction combinations.
We found:
*   88 - 24 + 34 = 98
*   34 + 88 - 24 = 98

Both use the numbers 88, 24, and 34 exactly once and result in 98. The order of operations for addition and subtraction is left-to-right, so parentheses are not strictly necessary for these specific expressions, but they can clarify.

Let's check if any other combinations with multiplication/division could work, though it seems unlikely given the target number and the large starting numbers.

Consider division first:
*   (88 / 24) * 34 - not integer
*   (88 / 34) * 24 - not integer
*   (24 / 88) * 34 - fraction
*   (24 / 34) * 88 - fraction
*   (34 / 88) * 24 - fraction
*   (34 / 24) * 88 - not integer

Consider multiplication first:
*   88 * 24 + 34 = 2112 + 34 = 2146 (Too high)
*   88 * 24 - 34 = 2112 - 34 = 2078 (Too high)
*   88 * 34 + 24 = 2992 + 24 = 3016 (Too high)
*   88 * 34 - 24 = 2992 - 24 = 2968 (Too high)
*   24 * 34 + 88 = 816 + 88 = 904 (Too high)
*   24 * 34 - 88 = 816 - 88 = 728 (Too high)

What about division as the last step?
*   (88 + 24) / 34 = 112 / 34 (not integer)
*   (88 - 24) / 34 = 64 / 34 (not integer)
*   (88 + 34) / 24 = 122 / 24 (not integer)
*   (88 - 34) / 24 = 54 / 24 (not integer)
*   (24 + 34) / 88 = 58 / 88 (fraction)
*   (24 - 34) / 88 = -10 / 88 (fraction)
*   (34 + 88) / 24 = 122 / 24 (not integer)
*   (34 - 88) / 24 = -54 / 24 (not integer)

What about multiplication as the last step?
*   (88 + 24) * 34 = 112 * 34 (Too high)
*   (88 - 24) * 34 = 64 * 34 (Too high)
*   (88 + 34) * 24 = 122 * 24 (Too high)
*   (88 - 34) * 24 = 54 * 24 (Too high)
*   (24 + 34) * 88 = 58 * 88 (Too high)
*   (24 - 34) * 88 = -10 * 88 (Too low)
*   (34 + 88) * 24 = 122 * 24 (Too high)
*   (34 - 88) * 24 = -54 * 24 (Too low)

It seems the simple addition/subtraction is the only way.
88 - 24 + 34 = 98.
This is a valid equation using all numbers once.
Another valid one is 34 + 88 - 24 = 98.
The prompt asks for ""your final, successful equation"". I will present one of them.

The user wants an equation using the numbers [36, 63, 44, 51] exactly once, with the target value of 45. I can only use +, -, *, /.

Let's analyze the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 36, 63, 44, 51
Target: 45

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to get 45.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are relatively large, and the target is moderate. This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the values.

Consider the relationship between the numbers:
63 is 9 * 7
36 is 6 * 6 or 4 * 9
44 is 4 * 11
51 is 3 * 17

Let's try to get close to 45.
If I use 51 and subtract something, I need to subtract 6. Can I make 6 from 36, 63, 44?
(63 - 36) = 27. Not 6.
(44 - 36) = 8. Not 6.
(63 / ?) - ? = 6?
(36 / ?) - ? = 6?

What if I try to make a number that, when combined with another, gets close to 45?
For example, if I can make 9, then 9 * 5 = 45. Can I make 5 from the remaining numbers?
Let's try to make 9 from two numbers.
63 / 7 = 9. I don't have 7.
36 / 4 = 9. I have 36 and 44. Can I make 4 from 44? No, not directly.
What if I use 44? 44 / 11 = 4. I don't have 11.

Let's try to make 45 directly.
Maybe a large number minus a smaller number?
51 - 6 = 45. Can I make 6 from 36, 63, 44?
(63 - 36) = 27.
(44 - 36) = 8.

What if I try to make a number that divides into another to get a useful result?
63 / 3 = 21. I don't have 3.
36 / 3 = 12. I don't have 3.
44 / 4 = 11. I don't have 4.

Let's try combining two numbers first.
36 + 63 = 99

63 / 51 = 7/3

44 + 51 = 95
44 - 51 = -7
44 * 51 = 2244
44 / 51 = 44/51

Let's look for combinations that might lead to 45.
If I have 12 (from 63-51), can I combine it with 36 and 44 to get 45?
12 + 36 + 44 = 92
12 * 36 + 44 = 432 + 44 = 476
12 + 36 * 44 = 12 + 1584 = 1596
12 * 44 + 36 = 528 + 36 = 564
(12 + 36) * 44 = 48 * 44 = 2112
(12 + 44) * 36 = 56 * 36 = 2016
(36 - 12) * 44 = 24 * 44 = 1056
(44 - 12) * 36 = 32 * 36 = 1152

The problem asks me to find a single, valid arithmetic equation using the numbers [62, 21, 57] exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target result of 98.

I need to explore different combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 62, N2 = 21, N3 = 57.
The target is T = 98.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

I will systematically try different groupings and orderings.

**Approach 1: Start with the largest number (62) and try to adjust it.**

*   **Possibility 1.1: 62 + something = 98**
    *   The ""something"" needs to be 98 - 62 = 36.
    *   Can I get 36 from 21 and 57 using +, -, *, /?
        *   21 + 57 = 78 (Too large)
        *   57 - 21 = 36 (This works!)
    *   So, the equation could be 62 + (57 - 21) = 98.
    *   Let's check: 62 + (36) = 98. This is correct.
    *   Numbers used: 62, 57, 21 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: +, - (allowed).
    *   Result: 98 (correct).
    *   This looks like a valid solution. I should continue exploring to ensure there aren't other possibilities or to confirm this is the most straightforward.

*   **Possibility 1.2: 62 - something = 98**
    *   The ""something"" needs to be 62 - 98 = -36.
    *   Can I get -36 from 21 and 57?
        *   21 - 57 = -36 (This works!)
    *   So, the equation could be 62 - (21 - 57) = 98.
    *   Let's check: 62 - (-36) = 62 + 36 = 98. This is correct.
    *   Numbers used: 62, 21, 57 (all used once).
    *   Operations used: -, - (allowed).
    *   Result: 98 (correct).
    *   This is another valid solution.

*   **Possibility 1.3: 62 * something = 98**
    *   The ""something"" needs to be 98 / 62. This is not an integer (98/62 = 49/31).
    *   Can I get 49/31 from 21 and 57? Unlikely with basic operations resulting in a fraction like this.
        *   21 / 57 = 7/19
        *   57 / 21 = 19/7
        *   21 * 57 = 1197
        *   57 - 21 = 36
        *   21 - 57 = -36
        *   21 + 57 = 78
    *   This path seems unlikely to yield 49/31. Discarding.

*   **Possibility 1.4: 62 / something = 98**
    *   The ""something"" needs to be 62 / 98 = 31 / 49.
    *   Can I get 31/49 from 21 and 57? Similar to 1.3, unlikely. Discarding.

**Approach 2: Start with multiplication involving two numbers.**

*   **Possibility 2.1: 62 * 21 ...**
    *   62 * 21 = 1302. This is much larger than 98.
    *   Can I subtract something from 1302 to get 98 using 57?
        *   1302 - 57 = 1245 (Too large)
        *   1302 + 57 = 1359 (Too large)
        *   1302 / 57 = Not an integer.
        *   57 / 1302 = Not useful.
    *   This path seems unlikely. Discarding.

*   **Possibility 2.2: 62 * 57 ...**
    *   62 * 57 = 3534. Even larger. Discarding.

*   **Possibility 2.3: 21 * 57 ...**
    *   21 * 57 = 1197. Even larger. Discarding.

**Approach 3: Start with division involving two numbers.**

*   **Possibility 3.1: 62 / 21 ...**
    *   62 / 21 is not an integer. Let's keep it as a fraction for now: 62/21.
    *   Can I combine 62/21 with 57 to get 98?
        *   (62/21) + 57 = (62 + 57*21) / 21 = (62 + 1197) / 21 = 1259 / 21 (Not 98)
        *   (62/21) - 57 = (62 - 57*21) / 21 = (62 - 1197) / 21 = -1135 / 21 (Not 98)
        *   57 - (62/21) = (57*21 - 62) / 21 = (1197 - 62) / 21 = 1135 / 21 (Not 98)
        *   (62/21) * 57 = (62 * 57) / 21 = 3534 / 21 = 1178 / 7 (Not 98)
        *   57 / (62/21) = 57 * 21 / 62 = 1197 / 62 (Not 98)

The user wants me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers [9, 18, 3, 75] and the operations +, -, *, / to achieve a result of 25. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 9, 18, 3, 75.
The target result is 25.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. This means I'll have three operations in total.

Let's try some combinations and see if they lead to 25.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op (c op d)
2. ((a op b) op c) op d
3. (a op (b op c)) op d
4. a op ((b op c) op d)
5. a op (b op (c op d))

Let's start with the largest number, 75, and see how we can get closer to 25.

Possibility 1: Using division with 75.
75 / 3 = 25. This is promising.
If I use 75 / 3, I have used 75 and 3. The remaining numbers are 9 and 18.
I need to combine 9 and 18 in a way that results in 0, so that (75 / 3) + (9 op 18) = 25 or (75 / 3) - (9 op 18) = 25.
Can I get 0 from 9 and 18 using one operation?
9 + 18 = 27 (No)
9 - 18 = -9 (No)
18 - 9 = 9 (No)
9 * 18 = 162 (No)
9 / 18 = 0.5 (No)
18 / 9 = 2 (No)
So, (75 / 3) + (9 op 18) or (75 / 3) - (9 op 18) won't work if the operation between 9 and 18 results in a non-zero number.

What if the 9 and 18 are used in a way that their result is 0 when combined with 75/3?
For example, if I have (75 / 3) + (something involving 9 and 18) = 25. This means (something involving 9 and 18) must be 0. As shown above, 9 and 18 cannot produce 0 with one operation.

Let's reconsider the structure. Maybe 75 is not the first number in a division.

Possibility 2: Using 75 in multiplication.
75 * 3 = 225 (Too large)
75 * 9 = 675 (Too large)
75 * 18 = (Too large)

Possibility 3: Using 75 in addition or subtraction.
75 + ... (will be > 25)
75 - ... = 25. This means the remaining numbers (9, 18, 3) must combine to 50.
Can 9, 18, 3 combine to 50?
Let's try combinations of 9, 18, 3.
(9 + 18) + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30 (No)
(9 + 18) - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24 (No)
(9 - 18) + 3 = -9 + 3 = -6 (No)
(18 - 9) + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12 (No)
(9 * 18) + 3 = 162 + 3 = 165 (No)
(9 * 18) - 3 = 162 - 3 = 159 (No)
(18 / 9) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 (No)
(18 / 9) * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6 (No)
(9 + 3) * 18 = 12 * 18 = 216 (No)
(18 + 3) * 9 = 21 * 9 = 189 (No)
(18 - 3) * 9 = 15 * 9 = 135 (No)
(9 * 3) + 18 = 27 + 18 = 45 (Close, but no)
(9 * 3) - 18 = 27 - 18 = 9 (No)
(18 * 3) + 9 = 54 + 9 = 63 (No)
(18 * 3) - 9 = 54 - 9 = 45 (Close, but no)
(9 + 18) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9 (No)
(18 - 9) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3 (No)
(9 * 18) / 3 = 162 / 3 = 54 (Close, but no)
(18 * 9) / 3 = 162 / 3 = 54 (Same)
(9 + 3) / 18 = 12 / 18 (Fraction)
(18 + 3) / 9 = 21 / 9 (Fraction)
(18 - 3) / 9 = 15 / 9 (Fraction)
(9 * 3) / 18 = 27 / 18 (Fraction)
(18 * 3) / 9 = 54 / 9 = 6 (No)

It seems unlikely that 9, 18, 3 combine to 50. So 75 - (combination of 9, 18, 3) = 25 is probably not the path.

Let's go back to the 75 / 3 = 25 idea.
We have 75, 3, 9, 18. Target 25.
We found 75 / 3 = 25.
We need to incorporate 9 and 18.
The equation could be structured as:
(75 / 3) op (9 op 18) = 25
or
(75 op 9) op (3 op 18) = 25
or
(75 op 18) op (3 op 9) = 25
or
((75 op 3) op 9) op 18 = 25
or
(75 op (3 op 9)) op 18 = 25
etc.

Let's try to make the remaining numbers (9 and 18) have a neutral effect on 25.
If we have (75 / 3) + (something with 9 and 18) = 25, then (something with 9 and 18) must be 0. We already established that 9 and 18 cannot make 0 with one operation.
What if we use subtraction? (75 / 3) - (something with 9 and 18) = 25. This also requires (something with 9 and 18) to be 0.

What if the 9 and 18 are used to modify the 3 or 75 before the division?
Example: 75 / (3 op 9 op 18) = 25. This means (3 op 9 op 18) must equal 3.
Can 3, 9, 18 combine to 3?
(9 + 18) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9 (No)
(18 - 9) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3. This works!
So, 75 / ((18 - 9) / 3) = 75 / (9 / 3) = 75 / 3 = 25.
Let's check the numbers used: 75, 18, 9, 3. All used exactly once.
Let's check the operations: /, -, /. All are fundamental arithmetic operations.
The result is 25.

This looks like a valid solution. Let's double check the order of operations and parentheses.
75 / ((18 - 9) / 3)
First, the innermost parenthesis: 18 - 9 = 9.
Then, the next parenthesis: 9 / 3 = 3.
Finally, the division: 75 / 3 = 25.

This equation uses all numbers [9, 18, 3, ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
59,1365,"<think>The goal is to use the numbers 80, 57, and 84 exactly once with +, -, *, / to arrive at 61.

Let's consider the numbers and the target value. 61 is a relatively small number compared to 80 and 84. This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the magnitude.

Possible combinations and their approximate values:
- 80 + 57 + 84 = 221 (too large)
- 80 * 57 * 84 (way too large)
- 80 - 57 - 84 = -61 (close, but negative)
- 84 - 57 - 80 = -53 (close, but negative)
- 80 + 57 - 84 = 53 (close)
- 80 - 57 + 84 = 107 (too large)
- 84 + 57 - 80 = 61 (This looks promising!)

Let's check the combination 84 + 57 - 80.
84 + 57 = 141
141 - 80 = 61

This uses all numbers (84, 57, 80) exactly once and only uses addition and subtraction. The result is 61.

Let's consider if multiplication or division could be involved.
If we multiply two numbers, the result will be quite large.
For example, 80 * 57 is very large. To get down to 61, we'd need significant division.
(80 * 57) / 84 = 4560 / 84 = 54.28... (not 61)
(80 * 84) / 57 = 6720 / 57 = 117.89... (not 61)
(57 * 84) / 80 = 4788 / 80 = 59.85 (close, but not 61)

What about division first?
80 / 57 * 84 = 1.40... * 84 = 117.89...
80 / 84 * 57 = 0.95... * 57 = 54.28...
57 / 80 * 84 = 0.71... * 84 = 59.85...
57 / 84 * 80 = 0.67... * 80 = 54.28...
84 / 57 * 80 = 1.47... * 80 = 117.89...
84 / 80 * 57 = 1.05 * 57 = 59.85...

It seems the simplest combination using only addition and subtraction is the most direct path.
The equation 84 + 57 - 80 = 61 satisfies all conditions.
Numbers used: 84, 57, 80 (all used once).
Operations used: +, - (fundamental arithmetic operators).
Result: 61.

Let's double check the order of operations if parentheses were implied.
(84 + 57) - 80 = 141 - 80 = 61. This is standard order.
84 + (57 - 80) = 84 + (-23) = 61. This also works.

The problem statement doesn't explicitly forbid parentheses, but it asks for a single mathematical equation. The simplest interpretation is to list the operations in sequence.

Consider other arrangements of 84, 57, 80 with + and -:
- 57 + 84 - 80 = 141 - 80 = 61
- 57 - 80 + 84 = -23 + 84 = 61
- 80 + 57 - 84 = 137 - 84 = 53 (Incorrect)
- 80 - 57 + 84 = 23 + 84 = 107 (Incorrect)
- 84 - 57 + 80 = 27 + 80 = 107 (Incorrect)
- 84 + 80 - 57 = 164 - 57 = 107 (Incorrect)

The combinations that yield 61 are:
1. 84 + 57 - 80
2. 57 + 84 - 80
3. 57 - 80 + 84
4. 84 - 80 + 57 (This is 4 + 57 = 61)

Let's verify 84 - 80 + 57.
84 - 80 = 4
4 + 57 = 61.
This also works and uses all numbers once with allowed operators.

The prompt asks for *a* single mathematical equation. Any of these valid ones will suffice.
I will choose the one that seems most straightforward in terms of calculation flow.
84 + 57 - 80 is a good candidate.
84 - 80 + 57 is also a good candidate.

Let's re-read the prompt carefully: ""formulate a single mathematical equation. This equation must incorporate every number provided in the set [80 57 84] exactly one time.""

The equation 84 - 80 + 57 = 61 fits perfectly.
Numbers: 84, 80, 57 (all used once).
Operators: -, + (allowed).
Result: 61.

Let's consider if there's any ambiguity about ""equation"". Usually, an equation has an equals sign. The prompt implies the *evaluation* of the expression should be 61. So, the expression itself is what needs to be formed.

The prompt asks for ""a single mathematical equation"". This implies the form `expression = result`. However, the instruction ""The ultimate evaluation of this equation should yield the specific value of 61"" suggests that the expression itself, when evaluated, should be 61. It doesn't explicitly say to write ""= 61"". It's more about the expression that *evaluates* to 61.

If I must present an equation, it would be `expression = 61`.
However, the phrasing ""formulate a single mathematical equation. This equation must incorporate every number..."" and then ""The ultimate evaluation of this equation should yield the specific value of 61"" is slightly ambiguous. It could mean the expression part of the equation.

Let's assume it means the expression that evaluates to 61.
The simplest expression is 84 - 80 + 57.

Let's consider the possibility of division leading to an integer result.
If we had (80+57)/x or similar, x would need to be a factor.
(80+57) = 137 (prime, not helpful)
(80-57) = 23 (prime, not helpful)
(84-57) = 27
(84+57) = 141
(80+84) = 164
(80-84) = -4
(57-84) = -27

If we use division, it's likely to be something like (A*B)/C or A/(B/C).
Let's revisit (57 * 84) / 80 = 59.85. Close.
Let's revisit 84 / 80 * 57 = 59.85. Close.

The simplest and most direct solution is using only addition and subtraction.
84 - 80 + 57 = 61.
This uses 84, 80, 57 exactly once.
It uses - and +.
It evaluates to 61.

The prompt asks for ""a single mathematical equation"". If it means the full equation, then it would be `84 - 80 + 57 = 61`.
However, the instruction ""present only that final equation within the designated <answer></answer> tags"" and ""Absolutely no additional explanatory text or commentary should be placed outside of these two types of tags"" suggests that the output should be just the equation itself.

If the intention is to present the expression that evaluates to 61, then `84 - 80 + 57` is the answer.
If the intention is to present the full equation, then `84 - 80 + 57 = 61` is the answer.

The phrasing ""The ultimate evaluation of this equation should yield the specific value of 61"" implies that the equation *itself* when evaluated",0.0,Answer content is empty.
3145,1976,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 14, 5, 63, and 21 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to form an equation that evaluates to 28.

Let the given numbers be $a=14$, $b=5$, $c=63$, $d=21$. We need to find an arrangement and operations such that the expression equals 28.

Let's list the numbers: 14, 5, 63, 21.
Target value: 28.

We have four numbers. We can combine them in various ways.
Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op (c op d)
2. ((a op b) op c) op d
3. (a op (b op c)) op d
4. a op ((b op c) op d)
5. a op (b op (c op d))
and so on.

Let's try to combine the numbers to get values close to 28 or values that can be combined with other numbers to reach 28.

Consider the largest number, 63.
If we divide 63 by something, we might get smaller numbers.
63 / 21 = 3.
Now we have 3, 14, 5. We need to get 28.
Can we combine 3, 14, 5 to get 28?
14 + 5 + 3 = 22 (too small)
14 * 3 - 5 = 42 - 5 = 37 (too large)
14 * 5 - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67 (too large)
(14 + 5) * 3 = 19 * 3 = 57 (too large)
(14 - 5) * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27 (close!)
If we have 27, we need to add 1 to get 28. But we don't have 1.

Let's try another combination with 63 and 21.
63 - 21 = 42.
Now we have 42, 14, 5. We need to get 28.
Can we combine 42, 14, 5 to get 28?
42 - 14 = 28. We used 63, 21, 14. We have 5 left.
So, (63 - 21) - 14 = 42 - 14 = 28. We still have 5.
We need to incorporate 5.
Maybe (63 - 21) - 14 + 5 = 28 + 5 = 33 (too large)
Maybe (63 - 21) - (14 + 5) = 42 - 19 = 23 (too small)
Maybe (63 - 21) - (14 - 5) = 42 - 9 = 33 (too large)
Maybe (63 - 21) - (5 - 14) is not valid as 5-14 is negative.

Let's try 63 + 21 = 84.
Now we have 84, 14, 5. We need to get 28.
84 / 14 = 6.
Now we have 6, 5. We need to get 28.
6 * 5 = 30 (close!)
6 + 5 = 11
6 - 5 = 1
5 - 6 = -1
So, (63 + 21) / 14 = 84 / 14 = 6.
Then we have 6 and 5. We need 28.
Can we get 28 from 6 and 5? No.

Let's try using 14.
14 * 2 = 28. Can we get 2 from the other numbers?
Numbers are 5, 63, 21.
63 / 21 = 3. We have 3 and 5. Can we get 2? 5 - 3 = 2.
So, we have 14 * (5 - (63 / 21)).
Let's check: 14 * (5 - 3) = 14 * 2 = 28.
This uses all numbers: 14, 5, 63, 21.
The operations are *, -, /.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's verify the order of operations.
14 * (5 - (63 / 21))
First, the innermost parenthesis: 63 / 21 = 3.
Then, the next parenthesis: 5 - 3 = 2.
Finally, the multiplication: 14 * 2 = 28.

This equation uses all numbers (14, 5, 63, 21) exactly once and evaluates to 28 using basic operations.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.

What if we start with 21?
21 * 2 = 42. Can we get 2 from 14, 5, 63?
63 / (14 + 5) = 63 / 19 (not an integer)
(63 - 5) / 14 = 58 / 14 (not an integer)
(63 + 5) / 14 = 68 / 14 (not an integer)
(14 + 5) - 63 = 19 - 63 = -44
63 - (14 + 5) = 63 - 19 = 44
14 * 5 = 70. 63.
70 - 63 = 7.
We need to get 2.

Let's try dividing 63 by 5. Not an integer.
Let's try dividing 21 by 5. Not an integer.
Let's try dividing 14 by 5. Not an integer.

Consider the target 28.
Possible factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
We have 14. So, 14 * 2 = 28. We need to get 2 from 5, 63, 21.
We found 5 - (63 / 21) = 5 - 3 = 2. This works.
Equation: 14 * (5 - (63 / 21)) = 28.

What if we try to get 4?
We have 14, 5, 63, 21.
Can we get 7?
63 / (21 / ?)
63 / 21 = 3.
14 + 5 = 19.
14 - 5 = 9.
5 - 14 = -9.
14 * 5 = 70.
63 - 14 = 49.
63 - 5 = 58.
63 - 21 = 42.
63 + 21 = 84.
21 - 14 = 7.
So, we have 7. We used 21 and 14.
Now we have 7, 5, 63. We need to get 28.
Can we combine 7, 5, 63 to get 28?
7 * 5 = 35. 35 - 63 (negative)
7 * 63 (too large)
7 + 5 = 12. 12 + 63 = 75.
7 + 63 = 70. 70 - 5 = 65.
63 - 7 = 56. 56 / 5 (not integer)
63 - 5 = 58. 58 / 7 (not integer)
(63 + 5) / 7 = 68 / 7 (not integer)
(63 - 5) / 7 = 58 / 7 (not integer)

Let's try to get 7 from other numbers.
We have 14, 5, 63, 21.
Can we get 4?
We have 14, 5, 63, 21.
Try to get 4.

1723,358,"<think>The target number is 26. The available numbers are 58, 55, and 2. I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with multiplication:**
    *   58 * 55 is too large.
    *   58 * 2 = 116. Then I need to get from 116 to 26 using 55. 116 - 55 = 61 (not 26). 116 + 55 is too large. 116 / 55 is not an integer. 55 - 116 is negative.
    *   55 * 2 = 110. Then I need to get from 110 to 26 using 58. 110 - 58 = 52 (not 26). 110 + 58 is too large. 110 / 58 is not an integer. 58 - 110 is negative.

2.  **Start with division:**
    *   58 / 2 = 29. Then I need to get from 29 to 26 using 55. 29 - 55 is negative. 55 - 29 = 26. This looks promising!
    *   Let's check: (58 / 2) - 55 = 29 - 55 = -26. This is not 26.
    *   Let's try the other way: 55 - (58 / 2) = 55 - 29 = 26. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 58, 2, 55. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, /. Allowed.
Result: 26. Correct.

The equation is 55 - (58 / 2) = 26.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.

3.  **Start with addition/subtraction:**
    *   58 + 55 = 113. Need to get to 26 using 2. 113 - 2 = 111. 113 + 2 = 115. 113 * 2 is too large. 113 / 2 is not integer.
    *   58 - 55 = 3. Need to get to 26 using 2. 3 * 2 = 6. 3 + 2 = 5. 3 - 2 = 1. 2 - 3 is negative.
    *   55 - 58 = -3. Need to get to 26 using 2. -3 * 2 = -6. -3 + 2 = -1. -3 - 2 = -5. 2 - (-3) = 5.
    *   58 + 2 = 60. Need to get to 26 using 55. 60 - 55 = 5. 55 - 60 = -5.
    *   58 - 2 = 56. Need to get to 26 using 55. 56 - 55 = 1. 55 - 56 = -1.
    *   2 - 58 = -56. Need to get to 26 using 55.
    *   55 + 2 = 57. Need to get to 26 using 58. 57 - 58 = -1. 58 - 57 = 1.
    *   55 - 2 = 53. Need to get to 26 using 58. 53 - 58 = -5. 58 - 53 = 5.
    *   2 - 55 = -53. Need to get to 26 using 58.

The combination 55 - (58 / 2) = 26 seems to be the most straightforward and correct one.
I should ensure the parentheses are correctly placed if needed. In this case, division has higher precedence than subtraction, so 58 / 2 would be calculated first anyway. However, explicitly writing it as 55 - (58 / 2) makes it clearer.

Let's double check the order of operations if I didn't use parentheses:
55 - 58 / 2
Division first: 58 / 2 = 29
Then subtraction: 55 - 29 = 26.
So, parentheses are not strictly necessary for this specific calculation due to standard operator precedence, but they can improve readability. The prompt asks for ""an equation"", and 55 - 58 / 2 = 26 is a valid equation.

Let's consider if there are other valid equations.
What about (58 / 2) - 55? That gave -26.
What about 58 / (55 - 2)? 58 / 53 (not integer)
What about 58 / (2 - 55)? 58 / -53 (not integer)
What about (55 - 2) / 58? 53 / 58 (not integer)
What about (2 - 55) / 58? -53 / 58 (not integer)

What about multiplication combined with subtraction/addition?
(58 * 2) - 55 = 116 - 55 = 61
55 - (58 * 2) = 55 - 116 = -61
(55 * 2) - 58 = 110 - 58 = 52
58 - (55 * 2) = 58 - 110 = -52

What about division combined with multiplication?
(58 / 2) * 55 = 29 * 55 (too large)
58 / (2 * 55) = 58 / 110 (not integer)

The solution 55 - 58 / 2 = 26 is the one.
I will present it without unnecessary parentheses as it follows standard order of operations.

3429,1293,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 43, 91, and 98 exactly once, with only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), that results in 50.

Let's list the numbers: 43, 91, 98.
Target sum: 50.

I need to combine these three numbers using +, -, *, / to get 50.
Let's try different combinations and orders.

Possible operations:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try starting with the largest numbers and see if subtraction can bring us closer to 50.

Try 98 and 91:
98 - 91 = 7. Then 7 op 43 = 50.
7 + 43 = 50. This works!
The numbers are 98, 91, 43.
The operations are -, +.
The order is (98 - 91) + 43.

Let's verify:
(98 - 91) + 43 = 7 + 43 = 50.
This uses each number (43, 91, 98) exactly once.
It uses only basic operations (+, -).
The result is 50.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure, though the first one found is usually sufficient.

What if we start with 91 and 43?
91 - 43 = 48. Then 48 op 98 = 50.
48 + 98 = 146 (too big)
98 - 48 = 50. This works!
The numbers are 91, 43, 98.
The operations are -, -.
The order is (91 - 43) - 98? No, that's 48 - 98 = -50.
The order is 98 - (91 - 43)? No, that's 98 - 48 = 50. This also works!
So, 98 - (91 - 43) = 50.
This uses 98, 91, 43. Operations are -, -. Result is 50.

What if we start with 98 and 43?
98 - 43 = 55. Then 55 op 91 = 50.
55 - 91 = -36 (not 50)
91 - 55 = 36 (not 50)

What about multiplication or division?
91 / 43 is not an integer.
98 / 43 is not an integer.
98 / 91 is not an integer.
43 * 91 is very large.
43 * 98 is very large.
91 * 98 is very large.

Let's go back to the first solution found: (98 - 91) + 43 = 50.
This is a valid and simple solution.

The second solution found: 98 - (91 - 43) = 50.
This is also valid.

I will present the first one as it's slightly more straightforward in terms of order of operations.
Numbers: 43, 91, 98.
Target: 50.
Equation: (98 - 91) + 43 = 50.
Check:
- Uses 43, 91, 98 exactly once. Yes.
- Uses only basic operations (+, -). Yes.
- Sums to 50. Yes.

Another check: 98 - 91 + 43 = 50. Order of operations would do subtraction first anyway.
So, 98 - 91 + 43 = 50 is also valid without parentheses.

Let's consider the second solution again: 98 - (91 - 43) = 50.
This is also valid.

The prompt asks for ""an equation"". Either is fine.
I'll stick with the first one found: (98 - 91) + 43 = 50.

70 - 67 = 3. This looks promising.
So, the equation could be 86 - (70 - 67).
Let's check: 86 - (3) = 83. This works.

Another approach:
What if I start with 70? I need to add 13 to get to 83. Can I make 13 from 67 and 86?
86 - 67 = 19. Not 13.
67 - 86 is negative.
67 + 86 is too large.

67 / 86 is not an integer.

What if I start with 67? I need to add 16 to get to 83. Can I make 16 from 86 and 70?
86 - 70 = 16. This also looks promising.

Both 86 - (70 - 67) and 67 + (86 - 70) are valid solutions. I will present one of them. The first one I found was 86 - (70 - 67).

Let's check if all numbers are used: 50, 78, 43, 30. Yes.
Let's check operations: -, -, -. Yes.
This looks like a valid solution.
Equation: 50 - (78 - 43 - 30) = 45.
Let's verify:
78 - 43 = 35
35 - 30 = 5
50 - 5 = 45.
This works.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

What if we use multiplication?
Can we make a number that, when multiplied by something, gets close to 45?
For example, if we can make 9, and then multiply by 5.
Can we make 9 from 50, 43, 30, 78?
(50 + 43 + 30 + 78) / ?
(50 + 43) - (78 - 30) = 93 - 48 = 45.
Numbers used: 50, 43, 78, 30. Operations: +, -, -. This is another valid solution.
Let's verify:
50 + 43 = 93
78 - 30 = 48
93 - 48 = 45.
This also works.

Let's try to make 5.
Can we make 5 from 50, 43, 30, 78?
We already found 78 - 43 - 30 = 5.
Then we need to use 50.
50 * (78 - 43 - 30) = 50 * 5 = 250 (too big)
50 / (78 - 43 - 30) = 50 / 5 = 10 (not 45)
(78 - 43 - 30) * 50 = 5 * 50 = 250 (too big)
(78 - 43 - 30) / 50 = 5 / 50 = 0.1 (not 45)

Let's try to make 45 directly.
(78 - 30) + (50 - 43) = 48 + 7 = 55 (close)
(78 - 43) + (50 - 30) = 35 + 20 = 55 (close)
(50 + 30) - (78 - 43) = 80 - 35 = 45.
Numbers used: 50, 30, 78, 43. Operations: +, -, -. This is another valid solution.
Let's verify:
50 + 30 = 80
78 - 43 = 35
80 - 35 = 45.
This also works.

Let's try division.
Can we make a number that divides into another to get 45? Unlikely with these numbers.
Can we make a number that is divided by something to get 45?
? / ? = 45.
Maybe a large number divided by a small number.
Let's try to make a large number.
50 * 78 = 3900. Can we make 3900 / ? = 45? ? = 3900 / 45 = 86.66 (not integer)
50 * 43 = 2150. 2150 / ? = 45? ? = 2150 / 45 = 47.77 (not integer)
50 * 30 = 1500. 1500 / ? = 45? ? = 1500 / 45 = 33.33 (not integer)
78 * 43 = 3354. 3354 / ? = 45? ? = 3354 / 45 = 74.53 (not integer)
78 * 30 = 2340. 2340",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The problem asks me to find a mathematical equation using the numbers 61, 4, 16, and 84, exactly once each, with only the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 68.

I need to combine these four numbers using the allowed operations. Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: [61, 4, 16, 84]
Target: 68

I should try different combinations and orders of operations. Parentheses can be used to control the order of operations.

Let's start by trying to get close to 68.
The numbers are 61, 4, 16, 84.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest number (84) and adjust.
2. Combine smaller numbers first.
3. Look for combinations that might yield numbers close to 68 or factors of numbers that could lead to 68.

Let's try combining 84 with other numbers.
84 - ? = 68. This means ? = 84 - 68 = 16.
So, if I can make 16 using 61, 4, and 16, that would be a solution. But I must use 16 itself. This means I need to use 61, 4, and 16 to make 16. This is not possible as I must use each number once.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe 61 is involved in a multiplication or addition that gets us close.
61 + ? = 68. ? = 7. Can I make 7 from 4, 16, 84?
(84 / 4) - 16 = 21 - 16 = 5. Not 7.
(16 / 4) + ? = 4 + ?
84 / (16 - 4) = 84 / 12 = 7. This looks promising!
So, if I can use 61 and the result of 84 / (16 - 4), which is 7, to get 68.
The numbers used are 84, 16, 4. The remaining number is 61.
The operation used to get 7 was division and subtraction.
So, I have 61 and 7. How to get 68?
61 + 7 = 68.
This looks like a valid solution.
Let's check the numbers used: 61, 84, 16, 4. All used exactly once.
Let's check the operations used: +, /, -. All basic arithmetic operations.
The equation would be 61 + (84 / (16 - 4)).

Let's verify the calculation:
16 - 4 = 12
84 / 12 = 7
61 + 7 = 68.
This works.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or to explore alternatives.

What if 84 is multiplied by something?
84 * ?
This will likely result in a number much larger than 68, unless the multiplier is a fraction.
84 * (4 / 16) = 84 * (1/4) = 21. Remaining numbers are 61. 21 + 61 = 82. Not 68.
84 * (16 / 4) = 84 * 4 = 336. Too large.

What if 61 is multiplied?
61 * ?
61 * (4 / 16) = 61 / 4. Not an integer.
61 * (16 / 4) = 61 * 4 = 244. Too large.

Let's consider division by 4 or 16.
84 / 4 = 21. Remaining numbers: 61, 16. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 21, 61, 16?
21 + 61 - 16 = 82 - 16 = 66. Close.
21 + 16 + 61 = 98.
61 - 16 + 21 = 45 + 21 = 66.
61 + 16 - 21 = 77 - 21 = 56.

84 / 16 = 5.25. Not an integer.

Let's try combining 16 and 4 first.
16 * 4 = 64. Remaining numbers: 61, 84. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 64, 61, 84?
64 + 61 - 84 = 125 - 84 = 41.
64 + 84 - 61 = 148 - 61 = 87.
84 - 61 + 64 = 23 + 64 = 87.

16 / 4 = 4. Remaining numbers: 61, 84. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 4, 61, 84?
4 + 61 + 84 = 149.
84 - 61 + 4 = 23 + 4 = 27.
61 - 4 + 84 = 57 + 84 = 141.
84 + 4 - 61 = 88 - 61 = 27.

16 + 4 = 20. Remaining numbers: 61, 84. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 20, 61, 84?
84 - 61 + 20 = 23 + 20 = 43.
61 - 20 + 84 = 41 + 84 = 125.
84 + 20 - 61 = 104 - 61 = 43.

16 - 4 = 12. Remaining numbers: 61, 84. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 12, 61, 84?
84 - 12 + 61 = 72 + 61 = 133.
61 + 12 + 84 = 157.
84 + 61 - 12 = 145 - 12 = 133.
This is where the first solution came from: 61 + (84 / (16 - 4)).
Here, we have 12, 61, 84. We need to combine them to get 68.
We used 16-4=12. Then we used 84/12=7. Then 61+7=68.
This confirms the previous solution.

Let's try combining 61 and 4.
61 + 4 = 65. Remaining numbers: 16, 84. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 65, 16, 84?
65 + 16 - 84 = 81 - 84 = -3.
84 - 16 + 65 = 68 + 65 = 133.
84 + 16 - 65 = 100 - 65 = 35.

61 - 4 = 57. Remaining numbers: 16, 84. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 57, 16, 84?
57 + 16 - 84 = 73 - 84 = -11.
84 - 16 + 57 = 68 + 57 = 125.
84 + 16 - 57 = 100 - 57 = 43.

61 * 4 = 244. Too large.
61 / 4. Not integer.

Let's try combining 61 and 16.
61 + 16 = 77. Remaining numbers: 4, 84. Target: 68.
Can I make 68 from 77, 4, 84?
77 + 4 - 84 = 81 - 84 = -3.
84 - 4 + 77 = 80 + 77 = 157.

2311,1149,"<think>The problem asks for an equation that uses the numbers 41, 42, 54, and 16 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to produce the result 13.

Let's list the numbers: {41, 42, 54, 16}.
The target is 13.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. I can try different groupings and orders of operations.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create smaller numbers that can be combined to reach 13.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers close to multiples of 13 or numbers that can easily be manipulated to get 13.

Let's explore some initial combinations:

Try combining two numbers first:
41 + 42 = 83
41 - 42 = -1
42 - 41 = 1
41 * 42 = 1722
41 / 42 (not an integer)
42 / 41 (not an integer)

41 + 54 = 95
41 - 54 = -13
54 - 41 = 13  <-- This is interesting! If I can use 54 and 41 to get 13, I then need to use 42 and 16 to somehow cancel out or result in 0 when combined with the 13.
Let's explore this path: (54 - 41) = 13.
Now I have 42 and 16 left. I need to combine them with 13 to get 13.
This means the combination of 42 and 16 must result in 0 when added or subtracted from 13, or 1 when multiplied or divided.
If I have 13 + (combination of 42 and 16) = 13, then (combination of 42 and 16) must be 0.
Can I get 0 from 42 and 16?
42 + 16 = 58
42 - 16 = 26
16 - 42 = -26
42 * 16 = 672
42 / 16 (not integer)
16 / 42 (not integer)
None of these give 0. So, (54 - 41) + (combination of 42 and 16) = 13 is unlikely unless the combination is 0.

What if the combination of 42 and 16 is multiplied by 13?
13 * (combination of 42 and 16) = 13. This means (combination of 42 and 16) must be 1.
Can I get 1 from 42 and 16? No, as seen above.

What if the 13 is part of a larger expression?
Let's go back to other combinations of two numbers.

41 + 16 = 57
41 - 16 = 25
16 - 41 = -25
41 * 16 = 656

16 / 42 (not integer)

54 + 16 = 70
54 - 16 = 38
16 - 54 = -38
54 * 16 = 864
54 / 16 (not integer)
16 / 54 (not integer)

Let's try combining three numbers and then the fourth.
Target is 13.

Consider division. Division often helps reduce large numbers.
Maybe 54 / something? Or 42 / something?

Let's try to get numbers that are factors of other numbers or can lead to small integers.
54 and 16. 54 is not divisible by 16. 16 is not divisible by 54.
42 and 16. 42 is not divisible by 16. 16 is not divisible by 42.
42 and 54. Neither is divisible by the other.
41 is prime, so it's unlikely to be a divisor unless the numerator is a multiple of 41.

Let's try to create a number close to 13 or a multiple of 13.
54 - 41 = 13. We already explored this.

What if we use multiplication to create a larger number and then subtract?
Let's try combining 42 and 16.
42 * 16 = 672. This is very large.
How can we use 41 and 54 to reduce this to 13?
672 - 41 - 54 = 672 - 95 = 577 (too large)
672 - (41 + 54) = 577
672 - (54 - 41) = 672 - 13 = 659
672 - (41 * 54) = 672 - 2214 (negative)
672 / (something) = 13? 672 / 13 is not an integer.

Let's try combining 41 and 16.
41 * 16 = 656.
How to use 42 and 54?
656 - 42 - 54 = 656 - 96 = 560
656 - (54 - 42) = 656 - 12 = 644
656 - (42 + 54) = 560

Let's try combining 42 and 54.
42 * 54 = 2268. Too large.

Let's try division first.
Maybe (54 / 16) or (42 / 16) or (54 / 42) or (42 / 54) or (16 / 42) or (16 / 54). These are not integers.
What if we create a numerator that is divisible by one of the numbers?

Let's try to get a number close to 13 by dividing a larger number by a smaller one.
Consider 54. Can we make a numerator using 41, 42, 16 that is a multiple of 54? Unlikely.
Consider 42. Can we make a numerator using 41, 54, 16 that is a multiple of 42?
41 + 54 + 16 = 111 (not multiple of 42)
41 * 16 = 656. 656 / 42 is not integer.
54 * 16 = 864. 864 / 42 is not integer.
41 * 54 = 2214. 2214 / 42 = 52.7... not integer.

Let's try to get a number that, when divided by one of the numbers, gives a result that helps reach 13.
For example, if we can get 26, then 26 / 2 = 13. Can we make 2 and 26 from the remaining numbers?

Let's try to construct expressions that result in small integers.
(42 - 16) = 26. We have 41 and 54 left.
Can we get 2 from 41 and 54?
54 - 41 = 13 (not 2)
41 - 54 = -13
54 / 41 (not integer)
41 / 54 (not integer)
41 + 54 = 95
41 * 54 = 2214

So, (42 - 16) / (something from 41, 54) = 13.
26 / (something from 41, 54) = 13.

3466,828,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 56, 35, and 86 to reach the target value of 65. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [56, 35, 86]
Target: 65

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to 65.

Possible combinations of two numbers first:
1. 56 + 35 = 91
2. 56 - 35 = 21
3. 56 * 35 = 1960
4. 56 / 35 = 1.6 (not an integer, might be tricky)
5. 35 - 56 = -21
6. 35 + 56 = 91
7. 35 * 56 = 1960
8. 35 / 56 = 0.625
9. 56 + 86 = 142
10. 56 - 86 = -30
11. 56 * 86 = 4816
12. 56 / 86 = 0.651...
13. 86 - 56 = 30
14. 86 + 56 = 142
15. 86 * 56 = 4816
16. 86 / 56 = 1.535...
17. 35 + 86 = 121

19. 35 * 86 = 3010
20. 35 / 86 = 0.406...
21. 86 - 35 = 51
22. 86 + 35 = 121
23. 86 * 35 = 3010
24. 86 / 35 = 2.457...

Now, let's try to incorporate the third number.

Let's start with the largest number, 86, and see if subtracting something can get us to 65.
86 - X = 65  => X = 86 - 65 = 21.
Can I make 21 using 56 and 35?
Yes, 56 - 35 = 21.
So, the equation could be 86 - (56 - 35).
Let's check: 86 - (56 - 35) = 86 - 21 = 65.
This uses all numbers [56, 35, 86] exactly once and only uses subtraction. This looks like a valid solution.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
What if we try to add to a number to get 65?
X + Y = 65.
Let's try using 35.
35 + X = 65 => X = 30.
Can I make 30 using 56 and 86?
Yes, 86 - 56 = 30.
So, the equation could be 35 + (86 - 56).
Let's check: 35 + (86 - 56) = 35 + 30 = 65.
This also uses all numbers [56, 35, 86] exactly once and uses addition and subtraction. This is also a valid solution.

Let's try using 56.
56 + X = 65 => X = 9.
Can I make 9 using 35 and 86?
86 - 35 = 51 (no)
35 - 86 = -51 (no)
86 / 35 (no)
35 / 86 (no)
35 * 86 (no)
86 * 35 (no)
So, this path doesn't seem to work easily.

Let's consider multiplication.
If we multiply two numbers, the result is usually large.
56 * 35 = 1960. How to get 65 from 1960 and 86? Unlikely.
56 * 86 = 4816. How to get 65 from 4816 and 35? Unlikely.
35 * 86 = 3010. How to get 65 from 3010 and 56? Unlikely.

Let's consider division.
56 / 35 = 1.6. Then use 86.
1.6 + 86 = 87.6 (no)
1.6 - 86 = -84.4 (no)
86 - 1.6 = 84.4 (no)
1.6 * 86 = 137.6 (no)

86 / 35 = 2.457... Then use 56.
2.457... + 56 = 58.457... (no)
56 - 2.457... = 53.543... (no)
2.457... * 56 = 137.6 (no)

86 / 56 = 1.535... Then use 35.
1.535... + 35 = 36.535... (no)
35 - 1.535... = 33.465... (no)
1.535... * 35 = 53.75 (no)

56 / 86 = 0.651... Then use 35.
0.651... + 35 = 35.651... (no)
35 - 0.651... = 34.349... (no)
0.651... * 35 = 22.785... (no)

35 / 86 = 0.406... Then use 56.
0.406... + 56 = 56.406... (no)
56 - 0.406... = 55.594... (no)
0.406... * 56 = 22.75 (no)

35 / 56 = 0.625. Then use 86.
0.625 + 86 = 86.625 (no)
86 - 0.625 = 85.375 (no)
0.625 * 86 = 53.75 (no)

It seems the subtraction-based solutions are the most straightforward.
I found two valid solutions:
1. 86 - (56 - 35) = 65
2. 35 + (86 - 56) = 65

The prompt asks for *an* equation. I will present the first one I found.
Let's double check the constraints:
- Use numbers [56 35 86]: Yes.
- Target value 65: Yes.
- Fundamental operations (+, -, *, /): Yes, only subtraction used.
- Each number used exactly once: Yes.

The equation 86 - (56 - 35) = 65 is correct.
The equation 35 + (86 - 56) = 65 is also correct.

I will present the first one.
86 - (56 - 35)
Step 1: Calculate the expression inside the parentheses.
56 - 35 = 21
Step 2: Substitute the result back into the equation.
86 - 21
Step 3: Perform the final subtraction.
86 - 21 = 65.

Possible combinations and approaches:
1.  Start with the largest numbers and try to adjust.
    *   67 + 9 = 76. Need to subtract 4. Can we get 4 from 46 and 60? 60 - 46 = 14. No. 46 / ? No.
    *   67 - 9 = 58. Need to add 14. Can we get 14 from 46 and 60? 60 - 46 = 14. Yes!
        So, (67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 58 + 14 = 72.
        This uses all numbers (9, 67, 60, 46) exactly once and only allowed operations.

    Maybe combine two numbers first.
    *   9 * 67 = 603 (too big)
    *   9 * 46 = 414 (too big)
    *   9 * 60 = 540 (too big)
    *   67 * 46 (too big)
    *   67 * 60 (too big)
    *   46 * 60 (too big)

    Maybe division?
    *   60 / 9 (not integer)
    *   60 / 46 (not integer)
    *   46 / 9 (not integer)
    *   46 / 67 (not integer)
    *   67 / 9 (not integer)
    *   67 / 46 (not integer)

    What about combining smaller results?
    *   (60 / ?) + ...
    *   (46 / ?) + ...

    Let's go back to the first successful attempt. It seems straightforward and correct.
    (67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 72

    Are there other possibilities?
    Let's try grouping differently.
    *   67 + 60 = 127. Need to subtract 55. Can we get 55 from 9 and 46? 46 + 9 = 55. Yes!
        So, (67 + 60) - (46 + 9) = 127 - 55 = 72.
        This also uses all numbers (67, 60, 46, 9) exactly once and only allowed operations.

    Let's verify this second solution.
    Numbers used: 67, 60, 46, 9. All used.
    Operations used: +, -, +. All allowed.
    Result: (67 + 60) - (46 + 9) = 127 - 55 = 72. Correct.

    The user asked for ""an equation"". Either one is fine. The first one found was (67 - 9) + (60 - 46). The second one is (67 + 60) - (46 + 9).

    Let's try to find one more just in case.
    *   60 + 9 = 69. Need to add 3. Can we get 3 from 67 and 46? 67 - 46 = 21. No.
    *   60 - 9 = 51. Need to add 21. Can we get 21 from 67 and 46? 67 - 46 = 21. Yes!
        So, (60 - 9) + (67 - 46) = 51 + 21 = 72.
        This uses all numbers (60, 9, 67, 46) exactly once and only allowed operations.

    Let's verify this third solution.
    Numbers used: 60, 9, 67, 46. All used.
    Operations used: -, +, -. All allowed.
    Result: (60 - 9) + (67 - 46) = 51 + 21 = 72. Correct.

    All three solutions are valid. I will pick the first one found.
    (67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 72
    The format required is <answer></answer>.
    So the output should be <answer>(67 - 9) + (60 - 46)</answer>.
    No, the user wants the equation to achieve the value 72. So it should be the expression.
    The prompt says ""Formulate an equation using [9 67 46 60] to achieve the value 72.""
    This implies the expression itself, not necessarily ""expression = 72"".
    Let's re-read carefully: ""Your final equation goes inside <answer></answer>.""
    This usually means the full equation, e.g., `expression = 72`.
    However, the example format is just `<answer>...</answer>`. If it were `expression = 72`, it would be `<answer>expression = 72</answer>`.
    Given the constraint ""No other text is allowed"", it's safer to assume they want just the expression that evaluates to 72.

    Let's consider the phrasing ""Formulate an equation"". An equation typically has an equals sign.
    If I put `(67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 72` inside `<answer></answer>`, it would be `<answer>(67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 72</answer>`.
    But the instruction ""No other text is allowed"" might mean *only* the content within `<answer></answer>` is allowed, and that content should be the equation.

    Let's assume the user wants the expression that *results* in 72. This is common in these types of puzzles.
    The first solution found was (67 - 9) + (60 - 46).
    Let's double check the prompt: ""Formulate an equation using [9 67 46 60] to achieve the value 72.""
    ""Your final equation goes inside <answer></answer>.""

    If I provide `(67 - 9) + (60 - 46)`, it's an expression.
    If I provide `(67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 72`, it's an equation.

    The instruction ""No other text is allowed"" is key. If I put the full equation, it's just that. If I put the expression, it's just that.
    Let's go with the full equation as it's more formally an ""equation"".

    Solution 1: (67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 72
    Solution 2: (67 + 60) - (46 + 9) = 72
    Solution 3: (60 - 9) + (67 - 46) = 72

    I'll use the first one.
    The output should be `<answer>(67 - 9) + (60 - 46) = 72</answer>`.

    Let's re-read again. ""Formulate an equation using [9 67 46 60] to achieve the value 72.""
    ""Your final equation goes inside <answer></answer>.""

    Consider the possibility that ""equation"" here means the expression that *equals* 72. This is a common interpretation in programming challenges or math puzzles where the goal is to find the combination.
    If the user wanted `expression = 72`, they might have said ""Write an equation that equals 72"".
    ""Formulate an equation using X to achieve Y"" can mean ""Find an expression using X that evaluates to Y"".

    Let's consider the constraint ""No other text is allowed"". If I put `<answer>(67 - 9) +",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

Let's try to combine the numbers.
The numbers 19, 8, 5, and 97 are quite spread out. The target is 60.

I can see 97 is a large number. If I subtract something from it, I might get closer to 60.
97 - ? = 60. So, ? = 37.
Can I get 37 from 19, 8, and 5?
19 + 8 + 5 = 32. Not 37.
19 * 5 = 95. Too big.
19 * 8 = 152. Too big.
8 * 5 = 40.
19 + 40 = 59. Close, but not 37.
19 - 8 = 11. 11 + 5 = 16.
19 - 5 = 14. 14 + 8 = 22.
8 - 5 = 3. 19 + 3 = 22.
19 + 8 = 27. 27 - 5 = 22.
19 + 5 = 24. 24 - 8 = 16.
8 + 5 = 13. 19 + 13 = 32.
8 - 5 = 3. 19 * 3 = 57.
19 * 8 = 152. 152 / 5 is not an integer.
19 * 5 = 95. 95 - 8 = 87.
8 * 5 = 40. 40 - 19 = 21.
8 * 5 = 40. 40 + 19 = 59.

Let's try another approach. Maybe combine some numbers to get a number that divides into another.
Or maybe combine numbers to get a multiple of 10 or 5.

Let's try to get 60 by multiplying two numbers.
Possible factors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.

19 * 3 (from 8-5) = 57.
19 * 8 = 152.
19 * 5 = 95.
8 * 5 = 40.

Let's try to make 60 by adding/subtracting from a larger number.
Maybe 97 is involved in a subtraction.

We need to combine these three numbers using two operations. The order of operations matters, so we should consider parentheses.

Let's try different combinations and see if we can get close to 66.

Possible structures:

Let's re-examine the successful one: (33 / 11) + 63 = 66.
This uses 33, 11, and 63.
The operations are division and addition.
The result is 66.",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4264,595,"<think>The problem asks me to create an equation using the numbers 6, 79, and 7, using each number exactly once, and only using the operations +, -, *, /. The target result is 92.

Let's list the numbers: 6, 79, 7.
The target is 92.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations to get 92. There are a few possible orders for the numbers and operations.

Let's try different combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with 79.
If I add 6 and 7 to 79, that's 79 + 6 + 7 = 92. This works!
Let's check if this uses each number exactly once and only allowed operations.
Numbers used: 79, 6, 7. Yes, all used exactly once.
Operations used: +. Yes, only addition.
Result: 92. Yes, the target.

So, one possible equation is 79 + 6 + 7 = 92.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, although I've already found a valid solution.

Possibility 2: Multiplication involved.
Maybe 79 * something?
79 * 6 = 474 (too big)
79 * 7 = 553 (too big)

Maybe multiply two smaller numbers and then combine with the third.
6 * 7 = 42.
Now I have 42 and 79.
Can I get 92 from 42 and 79 using + or -?
42 + 79 = 121 (too big)
79 - 42 = 37 (too small)
42 - 79 = -37 (too small)

What if I use 79 and 6, and then combine with 7?
79 * 6 = 474. Combine with 7.
474 + 7 = 481
474 - 7 = 467
7 - 474 = -467

What if I use 79 and 7, and then combine with 6?
79 * 7 = 553. Combine with 6.
553 + 6 = 559
553 - 6 = 547
6 - 553 = -547

Possibility 3: Division involved.
Division usually makes numbers smaller, which might be useful if we overshoot.
79 / 6 (not an integer)
79 / 7 (not an integer)
6 / 7 (not an integer)
7 / 6 (not an integer)

Let's consider the structure of the equation.
We have three numbers a, b, c and operations op1, op2.
Possible structures:
(a op1 b) op2 c
a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's re-examine the first successful attempt: 79 + 6 + 7 = 92.
This fits the structure (a op1 b) op2 c where a=79, b=6, c=7, op1=+, op2=+.
Or a op1 (b op2 c) where a=79, b=6, c=7, op1=+, op2=+.
Since addition is associative, the order of operations doesn't strictly matter here, but the numbers are used in a sequence.

Let's try to see if other combinations of operations can yield 92.
Numbers: 6, 7, 79. Target: 92.

Try starting with 79 and subtracting something.
79 - 6 = 73. Need to get 92 from 73 and 7.
73 + 7 = 80 (close, but not 92)
73 - 7 = 66
7 - 73 = -66

79 - 7 = 72. Need to get 92 from 72 and 6.
72 + 6 = 78 (close, but not 92)
72 - 6 = 66
6 - 72 = -66

Try starting with 6 and 7.
6 + 7 = 13. Need to get 92 from 13 and 79.
13 + 79 = 92. This is the same solution as before, just written as (6+7)+79.
79 + 13 = 92.

6 * 7 = 42. Need to get 92 from 42 and 79.
42 + 79 = 121
79 - 42 = 37

Let's consider the possibility of subtraction from a larger intermediate number.
If we multiply 7 and 6, we get 42.
If we multiply 79 by something, it gets too big.

What if we use subtraction in a different way?
Maybe (79 + 7) - 6?
79 + 7 = 86.
86 - 6 = 80. (Not 92)

Maybe (79 + 6) - 7?
79 + 6 = 85.
85 - 7 = 78. (Not 92)

Maybe (6 + 79) - 7?
6 + 79 = 85.
85 - 7 = 78. (Not 92)

Maybe (7 + 79) - 6?
7 + 79 = 86.
86 - 6 = 80. (Not 92)

What about multiplication and addition/subtraction?
Let's try to get a number close to 92 using multiplication.
6 * 7 = 42.
We have 42 and 79.
79 + 42 = 121
79 - 42 = 37
42 - 79 = -37

What if we multiply 79 by a fraction formed by the other numbers? Not allowed, only +, -, *, /.

Let's go back to the simplest solution: 79 + 6 + 7 = 92.
This is a valid equation.
The numbers are 6, 79, 7.
The operations are +.
Each number is used exactly once.
The result is 92.

Let's check if there are any other simple combinations.
Could we use subtraction to get 92?
Suppose we have a large number and subtract from it.
If we multiply 79 by 6, we get 474.
474 - 7 = 467.
474 + 7 = 481.

If we multiply 79 by 7, we get 553.
553 - 6 = 547.
553 + 6 = 559.

If we multiply 6 by 7, we get 42.
We have 42 and 79.
79 + 42 = 121.
79 - 42 = 37.

Let's consider the structure a op1 b op2 c.
If op1 is +, op2 is +.
79 + 6 + 7 = 92. (Found)
79 + 7 + 6 = 92. (Same)
6 + 79 + 7 = 92. (Same)
6 + 7 + 79 = 92. (Same)
7 + 79 + 6 = 92. (Same)
7 + 6 + 79 = 92. (Same)

If op1 is +, op2 is -.
(79 + 6) - 7 = 85 - 7 = 78.
(79 + 7) - 6 = 86 - 6 = 80.
(6 + 79) - 7 = 85 - 7 = 78.
(6 + 7) - 79 = 13 - 79 = -66.
(7 + 79) - 6 = 86 - 6 = 80.
(7 + 6) - 79 = 13 - 79 = -66.

If op1 is -, op2 is +.
(79 - 6) + 7 = 73 + 7 = 80.
(79 - 7) + 6 = 72 + 6 = 78.
(6 - 79) + 7 = -73 + 7 = -66.
(6 - 7) + 79 = -1 + 79 = 78.

2839,44,"<think>The target number is 58. The available numbers are 39, 58, 22, and 55.
I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's try to get close to 58 first.
The number 58 is already in the list. Can I use the other numbers to cancel each other out or result in 0 or 1?

Option 1: Use 58 directly and make the rest equal 0.
(39 - 39) + (22 - 22) = 0. This uses 39 twice and 22 twice. Not allowed.
(39 + 22) - 55 = 61 - 55 = 6. Not 0.
(39 - 22) + 55 = 17 + 55 = 72. Not 0.
(39 * 22) - 55 = 858 - 55 = 803. Not 0.
(39 / 22) - 55. Not an integer.

Option 2: Try to combine numbers to get 58.
Maybe I can get a number close to 58 and add/subtract the remaining.

Let's try combining 39 and 22.
39 + 22 = 61. Remaining are 58, 55.
61 + 58 - 55 = 119 - 55 = 64.
61 - 58 + 55 = 3 + 55 = 58. This works!
The numbers used are 39, 22, 58, 55.
The operations are +, -, +.
The equation is (39 + 22) - 58 + 55 = 58.
Let's check the order of operations.
39 + 22 = 61
61 - 58 = 3
3 + 55 = 58.
This is a valid equation.

Let's try another combination to be sure.
Maybe start with 55.
55 + 39 = 94. Remaining are 58, 22.
94 - 58 + 22 = 36 + 22 = 58. This also works!
The numbers used are 55, 39, 58, 22.
The operations are +, -, +.
The equation is (55 + 39) - 58 + 22 = 58.
Let's check the order of operations.
55 + 39 = 94
94 - 58 = 36
36 + 22 = 58.
This is also a valid equation.

Let's try another.
Maybe start with 55 and 22.
55 + 22 = 77. Remaining are 39, 58.
77 - 39 + 58 = 38 + 58 = 96.
77 - 58 + 39 = 19 + 39 = 58. This works!
The numbers used are 55, 22, 58, 39.
The operations are +, -, +.
The equation is (55 + 22) - 58 + 39 = 58.
Let's check the order of operations.
55 + 22 = 77
77 - 58 = 19
19 + 39 = 58.
This is also a valid equation.

Let's try multiplication.
39 * 22 = 858. Too big.
39 * 58. Too big.
39 * 55. Too big.
22 * 58. Too big.
22 * 55. Too big.
58 * 55. Too big.

What about division?
58 / 22. Not integer.
58 / 39. Not integer.
58 / 55. Not integer.
39 / 22. Not integer.
39 / 58. Not integer.
39 / 55. Not integer.
22 / 39. Not integer.
22 / 58. Not integer.
22 / 55. Not integer.
55 / 39. Not integer.
55 / 22. Not integer.
55 / 58. Not integer.

It seems addition and subtraction are the most likely candidates.
Let's re-examine the first solution found: (39 + 22) - 58 + 55 = 58.
This uses 39, 22, 58, 55. All numbers used once. Operations +, -, +. Result is 58.

Let's try to use 58 in a different way.
Maybe 58 is part of a multiplication or division that results in a smaller number.
For example, if we had 116, we could do 116 / 2 = 58.
Can we make 116 from 39, 22, 55?
39 + 22 + 55 = 116.
So, (39 + 22 + 55) / 2 = 116 / 2 = 58.
But we don't have a '2'. We have 58.

Let's try to make 58 using 39, 22, 55, and then add/subtract 58.
If we can make 0 from 39, 22, 55, then 0 + 58 = 58.
39 + 22 - 55 = 61 - 55 = 6. Not 0.
39 - 22 + 55 = 17 + 55 = 72. Not 0.
39 - 55 + 22 = -16 + 22 = 6. Not 0.
22 + 55 - 39 = 77 - 39 = 38. Not 0.
22 - 55 + 39 = -33 + 39 = 6. Not 0.
55 - 39 - 22 = 16 - 22 = -6. Not 0.

If we can make 1 from 39, 22, 55, then 58 * 1 = 58.
Can we make 1 from 39, 22, 55?
(39 + 22) / 55 = 61 / 55. Not 1.
(55 + 22) / 39 = 77 / 39. Not 1.
(55 - 39) / 22 = 16 / 22. Not 1.
(39 - 22) / ?
(55 - 22) / 39 = 33 / 39. Not 1.

Let's go back to the first solution found: (39 + 22) - 58 + 55 = 58.
This is a valid solution.
Let's check the second solution: (55 + 39) - 58 + 22 = 58.
This is also a valid solution.
Let's check the third solution: (55 + 22) - 58 + 39 = 58.
This is also a valid solution.

I need to provide *an* equation. The first one I found is perfectly fine.
(39 + 22) - 58 + 55 = 58.
Let's write it without parentheses, relying on order of operations.
39 + 22 - 58 + 55
39 + 22 = 61
61 - 58 = 3
3 + 55 = 58.
This works.

Another possibility:
Can we make 58 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting?
For example, 2 * 29 = 58. We don't have 2 or 29.
Can we make 2 from the numbers?
(39 - 55 + 22) = 6. No.
(55 - 39 - 22) = -6. No.

5150,1653,"<think>The numbers are [80, 41, 43] and the target is 82. I need to use each number exactly once with basic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with 80.
- 80 + 41 + 43 = 164 (too high)
- 80 - 41 - 43 = -4 (too low)
- 80 + 41 - 43 = 78 (close, but not 82)
- 80 - 41 + 43 = 82. This works!

Let's verify: 80 - 41 = 39. Then 39 + 43 = 82.
All numbers [80, 41, 43] are used exactly once.
The operations are subtraction and addition, which are basic operations.
The result is exactly 82.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, though I've found a solution.

Possibility 2: Start with 41.
- 41 * 2 = 82. But I don't have a 2. I have 80 and 43.
- (41 + 43) = 84. Then 84 - 80 = 4 (not 82)
- (41 - 43) = -2. Then -2 + 80 = 78 (not 82)
- (43 - 41) = 2. Then 2 * 80 = 160 (too high)
- 41 * 80 ... this will be a very large number.

Possibility 3: Start with 43.
- (43 + 80) = 123. Then 123 - 41 = 82. This also works!
Let's verify: 43 + 80 = 123. Then 123 - 41 = 82.
All numbers [43, 80, 41] are used exactly once.
The operations are addition and subtraction.
The result is exactly 82.

Possibility 4: Using division.
- 80 / 41 is not an integer.
- 80 / 43 is not an integer.
- 41 / 80 is not an integer.
- 41 / 43 is not an integer.
- 43 / 80 is not an integer.
- 43 / 41 is not an integer.
Division is unlikely to be useful here unless it results in a whole number that can then be used.

I need to combine these four numbers to get 90. Let's look at the numbers and the target.
Numbers: 21, 20, 99, 50
Target: 90

The numbers are relatively large, especially 99 and 50. The target 90 is also a moderate number.

Let's try to combine the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
99 and 50.
99 + 50 = 149 (too large)
99 - 50 = 49
50 - 99 = -49
99 * 50 = 4950 (way too large)

99 - 21 = 78
21 - 99 = -78
99 * 21 (too large)
99 / 21 (not an integer)

Let's consider 99 and 20.
99 + 20 = 119
99 - 20 = 79
20 - 99 = -79
99 * 20 (too large)
99 / 20 (not an integer)
20 / 99 (not an integer)

Let's consider 50 and 21.
50 + 21 = 71
50 - 21 = 29
21 - 50 = -29
50 * 21 = 1050 (too large)
50 / 21 (not an integer)

Let's consider 50 and 20.
50 + 20 = 70
50 - 20 = 30
20 - 50 = -30
50 * 20 = 1000 (too large)

21 / 20 (not an integer)
20 / 21 (not an integer)

It seems direct addition or subtraction of two numbers doesn't immediately get us close to 90, except maybe 99 - 21 = 78, and we need to get 12 from 50 and 20.
If we have 78, we need to add 12. Can we get 12 from 50 and 20?
50 + 20 = 70
50 - 20 = 30
20 - 50 = -30
50 * 20 = 1000
50 / 20 = 2.5
20 / 50 = 0.4
No, we cannot get 12 from 50 and 20.

What if we try to get a number close to 90 by multiplication?
The numbers are 21, 20, 99, 50.
If we multiply two numbers, the result is usually large.
21 * 20 = 420
21 * 50 = 1050
21 * 99 = 2079
20 * 50 = 1000
20 * 99 = 1980
50 * 99 = 4950

This suggests that multiplication might be used to create a larger number that is then reduced, or perhaps multiplication is used on smaller intermediate results.

Let's try to get a number close to 90 using one of the numbers.
If we use 99, we need to subtract 9. Can we get 9 from 21, 20, 50?
21 + 20 + 50 = 91
21 + 20 - 50 = -9
21 - 20 + 50 = 51
21 - 20 - 50 = -51
20 - 21 + 50 = 49
20 - 21 - 50 = -51
50 - 21 + 20 = 49
50 - 21 - 20 = 9. Yes!
So, 99 - (50 - 21 - 20) = 99 - (29 - 20) = 99 - 9 = 90.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 99, 50, 21, 20. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, -, -. Yes.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just in case.

What if we use 50? We need to add 40. Can we get 40 from 21, 20, 99?
21 + 20 = 41. Close.
If we have 50 + (21 + 20), we get 91. We need 90.
Can we adjust this?
Maybe 50 + (21 + 20) - 1? But we don't have a 1.
What if we use 99?
50 + (99 - 21 - 20) = 50 + (78 - 20) = 50 + 58 = 108. No.
50 + (99 - (21+20)) = 50 + (99 - 41) = 50 + 58 = 108. No.

Let's try to get 90 by multiplication involving one of the numbers.
If we multiply something by 20, we might get a multiple of 20. 90 is not a multiple of 20.
If we multiply something by 50, we might get a multiple of 50. 90 is not a multiple of 50.
If we multiply something by 21, we might get a multiple of 21. 90 is not a multiple of 21.
If we multiply something by 99, we might get a multiple of 99. 90 is not a multiple of 99.

This suggests that multiplication might not be the last operation.

Let's consider division.
If the last operation is division, say A / B = 90.
This means A must be a multiple of 90.
Possible A values using the numbers:
21 * 20 = 420
21 * 50 = 1050
21 * 99 = 2079
20 * 50 = 1000
20 * 99 = 1980
50 * 99 = 4950
21 * 20 * 50 = 21000
... these are all very large.

Let's re-examine the solution found: 99 - (50 - 21 - 20) = 90.
This uses 99, 50, 21, 20.
The expression is 99 - (50 - 21 - 20).
Let's evaluate step-by-step:
50 - 21 = 29
29 - 20 = 9
99 - 9 = 90.
This is correct.

Let's try to find another one.
What if we try to make 90 directly?
Maybe 20 * X + Y = 90 or 50 * X + Y = 90.
If we use 20 * 4.5 = 90. Can we get 4.5 from 21, 99, 50?

    *   70 - 45 = 25. Remaining numbers are 53, 11. Can I get 2 from 53 and 11? 53/11 is not an integer. 53-11 = 42. 53+11 = 64. 53*11 = 583. No.
    *   70 - 53 = 17. Remaining numbers are 45, 11. Can I get 10 from 45 and 11? 45-11 = 34. 45+11 = 56. 45/11 not integer. 45*11 = 495. No.
    *   53 - 45 = 8. Remaining numbers are 70, 11. Can I get 19 from 70 and 11? 70-11 = 59. 70+11 = 81. 70/11 not integer. 70*11 = 770. No.

2.  Try multiplication early:
    *   45 * 11 = 495. Remaining numbers are 53, 70. Can I get 27 from 495, 53, 70? This seems unlikely to get a small number like 27.
    *   45 * (something small)
    *   Let's try to get a number close to 27 using two numbers and then adjust with the others.

3.  Consider division:
    *   70 / 11 is not an integer.
    *   45 / 11 is not an integer.
    *   53 / 11 is not an integer.
    *   70 / 45 is not an integer.
    *   70 / 53 is not an integer.
    *   45 / 53 is not an integer.
    *   This suggests division might be the last operation or used in a way that results in an integer.

Let's try to build up to 27.
Maybe a large number minus something.
Target is 27.
Numbers are [45, 53, 70, 11].

Try combining two numbers to get a number that, when combined with the other two, yields 27.

What if we try to make a number slightly larger than 27 and subtract?
Or a number slightly smaller and add?

Let's try grouping:
*   (70 - 45) = 25. We need +2 from 53 and 11. Not possible.
*   (53 - 45) = 8. We need +19 from 70 and 11. Not possible.
*   (70 - 53) = 17. We need +10 from 45 and 11. Not possible.

Let's try multiplication with one of the smaller numbers.
*   11 * (something)
    *   11 * 4 = 44. Need -17 from 70, 53. 70-53 = 17. So 44 - 17 = 27.
    *   How to get 4 from 45, 53, 70? Not directly.

Let's try to get a number that divides nicely.
Maybe 70 / (something).
If we can make 70 / X = Y, and then use the remaining numbers to get 27 - Y or 27 + Y.

Let's try to get a number close to 27 by combining two numbers, then use the other two.
*   45 + 11 = 56. Remaining: 53, 70. Can we get 27 from 56, 53, 70?

    *   42 + 70 - 45 = 67.
    *   70 + 45 - 42 = 73.

*   70 + 11 = 81. Remaining: 45, 53. Can we get 27 from 81, 45, 53?
    *   81 - 45 - 53 = -17.
    *   81 - 53 - 45 = -17.
    *   81 - (45+53) = 81 - 98 = -17.
    *   81 - (53-45) = 81 - 8 = 73.
    *   81 - (45-53) = 81 - (-8) = 89.

    *   59 - 45 + 53 = 67.
    *   59 + 45 - 53 = 51.
    *   59 - 53 + 45 = 51.

Let's try multiplication with one of the larger numbers.
*   45 * (something)
*   53 * (something)
*   70 * (something)

Consider the target 27.
Maybe (A * B) - C + D = 27 or (A * B) + C - D = 27.

Let's try to make a number close to 27 using multiplication and then adjust.

Let's try to get 27 by subtracting a small number from a larger one.

    *   53 + 11 - 45 = 19.
    *   45 + 53 - 11 = 87.

Maybe 53 - X = 27, so X = 26. Can we make 26 from 45, 70, 11?

3264,76,"<think>The user wants me to derive an equation that results in 16 using the numbers 90, 48, and 58 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /.

I need to explore different combinations of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 90, 48, 58.
Target: 16.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then incorporating the third.

Combination 1: (90 op1 48) op2 58 = 16
Combination 2: (90 op1 58) op2 48 = 16
Combination 3: (48 op1 58) op2 90 = 16

Let's explore Combination 1: (90 op1 48) op2 58 = 16

*   90 + 48 = 138. 138 op2 58 = 16.
    *   138 - 58 = 80 (not 16)
    *   138 + 58 = 196 (not 16)
    *   138 * 58 (too large)
    *   138 / 58 (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 16 easily)
*   90 - 48 = 42. 42 op2 58 = 16.
    *   42 - 58 = -16 (close, but not 16)
    *   42 + 58 = 100 (not 16)
    *   42 * 58 (too large)
    *   42 / 58 (not an integer)
*   90 * 48 (too large)
*   90 / 48 (not an integer)

Let's explore Combination 2: (90 op1 58) op2 48 = 16

*   90 + 58 = 148. 148 op2 48 = 16.
    *   148 - 48 = 100 (not 16)
    *   148 + 48 = 196 (not 16)
    *   148 * 48 (too large)
    *   148 / 48 (not an integer)
*   90 - 58 = 32. 32 op2 48 = 16.
    *   32 - 48 = -16 (close, but not 16)
    *   32 + 48 = 80 (not 16)
    *   32 * 48 (too large)
    *   32 / 48 (not an integer)
*   90 * 58 (too large)
*   90 / 58 (not an integer)

Let's explore Combination 3: (48 op1 58) op2 90 = 16

*   48 + 58 = 106. 106 op2 90 = 16.
    *   106 - 90 = 16. This works!
    *   The equation is (48 + 58) - 90 = 16.
    *   Let's check: 48 + 58 = 106. 106 - 90 = 16.
    *   Numbers used: 48, 58, 90 (all used exactly once).
    *   Operations used: +, - (allowed).
    *   Result: 16.

This seems to be a valid solution. Let's double check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one is straightforward.

What if the division is involved?
Let's reconsider 90 - 48 = 42. We need to get 16 from 42 and 58.
We saw 42 - 58 = -16. What if we negate this?
Could we do something like 58 - (90 - 48)?
58 - (42) = 16.
This uses 58, 90, 48. Operations are -, -. Result is 16.
This is also a valid solution: 58 - (90 - 48) = 16.

Let's check the first one again: (48 + 58) - 90 = 16.
Numbers: 48, 58, 90. Used once.
Operations: +, -. Allowed.
Result: 16.

Let's check the second one: 58 - (90 - 48) = 16.
Numbers: 58, 90, 48. Used once.
Operations: -, -. Allowed.
Result: 16.

Both are valid. The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I will provide the first one I found as it's slightly simpler in terms of parenthesis.

Let's try to see if multiplication or division could be used.
Maybe something like (90 / x) op y = 16 or (48 / x) op y = 16 or (58 / x) op y = 16.
None of the numbers divide each other nicely to get a small integer.
90/48, 90/58, 48/90, 48/58, 58/90, 58/48 are not integers.

What about multiplication?
If we multiply two numbers, the result is large.
90 * 48 = 4320
90 * 58 = 5220
48 * 58 = 2784

Let's try to get 16 by dividing a large number by a smaller one.
Suppose we have a large number and divide it by something to get 16.
Let's try to construct a large number using two numbers and then divide by the third.
Example: (90 * 48) / 58 = 4320 / 58 (not integer)
Example: (90 * 58) / 48 = 5220 / 48 (not integer)
Example: (48 * 58) / 90 = 2784 / 90 (not integer)

What if we add/subtract two numbers to get a number that divides the third, or vice versa?
Let's go back to the successful ones.
(48 + 58) - 90 = 16
58 - (90 - 48) = 16

Let's try another structure: a op (b op c) = 16
90 op (48 op 58) = 16
*   90 op (48 + 58) = 90 op 106.
    *   90 - 106 = -16 (close)
    *   90 + 106 = 196
    *   90 * 106 (too large)
    *   90 / 106 (not integer)
*   90 op (48 - 58) = 90 op (-10).
    *   90 - (-10) = 90 + 10 = 100 (not 16)
    *   90 + (-10) = 90 - 10 = 80 (not 16)
    *   90 * (-10) = -900 (not 16)
    *   90 / (-10) = -9 (not 16)
*   90 op (58 - 48) = 90 op 10.
    *   90 - 10 = 80 (not 16)
    *   90 + 10 = 100 (not 16)
    *   90 * 10 = 900 (not 16)
    *   90 / 10 = 9 (not 16)

48 op (90 op 58) = 16
*   48 op (90 + 58) = 48 op 148.
    *   48 - 148 = -100
    *   48 + 148 = 196

79 - 59 = 20
59 + 11 = 70 (close)
79 - (59 + 11) = 79 - 70 = 9 (not 69)
(79 - 11) + 59 = 68 + 59 = 127
(79 - 59) + 11 = 20 + 11 = 31
79 - 59 - 11 = 20 - 11 = 9
79 + 59 - 11 = 138 - 11 = 127
79 * 11 = 869
59 * 11 = 649
79 / 11 (no)
59 / 11 (no)

Let's try another starting point.
Maybe something like (A * B) - C - D or (A + B) - C * D.

Consider 98 and 11. 98 / 11 is not integer.
Consider 79 and 11. 79 / 11 is not integer.
Consider 59 and 11. 59 / 11 is not integer.

What if we use division to reduce a large number?
98 / ?
79 / ?
59 / ?

Let's try to make 29 directly.
Maybe a multiplication is involved to get a number close to 29, then adjust.
11 * ?
11 * 2 = 22 (need 7 more from [98, 79, 59])
11 * 3 = 33 (need -4 from [98, 79, 59])

Let's try to make 29 using subtraction from a larger number.
If we have 59, we need to subtract 30. Can we make 30 from [98, 79, 11]?
79 - 11 = 68
98 - 79 = 19
98 - 11 = 87
79 + 11 = 90
98 + 11 = 109
98 + 79 = 177
(98 - 79) + 11 = 19 + 11 = 30.
So, 59 - ((98 - 79) + 11) = 59 - (19 + 11) = 59 - 30 = 29.
This uses all numbers [98, 79, 59, 11] exactly once.
Let's verify the operations: subtraction, subtraction, addition. All allowed.

Let's write it out clearly:
Numbers: [98, 79, 59, 11]
Target: 29

Step 1: Combine 98 and 79 using subtraction.
98 - 79 = 19

Step 2: Combine the result (19) with 11 using addition.
19 + 11 = 30

Step 3: Combine 59 with the result (30) using subtraction.
59 - 30 = 29

This gives the equation: 59 - ( (98 - 79) + 11 ) = 29.
Let's check if parentheses are strictly necessary or if order of operations handles it.
59 - (98 - 79 + 11)
Inside parentheses: 98 - 79 = 19. Then 19 + 11 = 30.
So, 59 - 30 = 29.
The parentheses around (98 - 79) are not strictly necessary due to left-to-right evaluation of subtraction and addition, but they clarify the intermediate step. The outer parentheses around (98 - 79 + 11) are necessary to ensure that the entire sum is subtracted from 59.

Let's try another structure to be sure.
What about division?
Can we make a number that divides nicely?
98 / 2 = 49
79 / ?
59 / ?
11 / ?

Let's try to make 29 by adding to a smaller number.
11 + ? = 29 => ? = 18. Can we make 18 from [98, 79, 59]?
98 - 79 = 19 (close)
59 - ?
79 - 59 = 20 (close)
98 - 59 = 39

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe (A * B) / C + D or similar.
(79 * 11) = 869. Too big.
(59 * 11) = 649. Too big.
(98 * 11) = 1078. Too big.
(79 * 59) = 4661. Too big.

What if we divide first?
98 / 11 (no)
79 / 11 (no)
59 / 11 (no)

Let's re-examine the first solution: 59 - ((98 - 79) + 11) = 29.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to find another one just in case.
Consider 79. We need to get 29.
79 - ? = 29 => ? = 50. Can we make 50 from [98, 59, 11]?
98 - 59 = 39
98 - 11 = 87
59 - 11 = 48 (close)
98 - (59 - 11) = 98 - 48 = 50.
So, 79 - (98 - (59 - 11)) = 79 - (98 - 48) = 79 - 50 = 29.
This also uses all numbers [98, 79, 59, 11] exactly once.
Operations: subtraction, subtraction, subtraction. All allowed.

Let's verify:
79 - (98 - (59 - 11))
Innermost: 59 - 11 = 48
Next: 98 - 48 = 50
Outermost: 79 - 50 = 29.
This is also a valid solution.

The user asked for ""a mathematical equation"". Either one is fine.

- Try to get close to 97 by adding or subtracting some numbers.
  - 56 + 41 = 97. This uses 56 and 41. I still have 31 and 32 left. I need to incorporate them in a way that doesn't change the sum of 97. This means the remaining part must evaluate to 0.

  - Now I have 1, 56, 41. Target 97.

The problem asks us to find an equation using the numbers [28, 14, 80, 30] and the operations +, -, *, / to reach the target value of 100. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's analyze the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 28, 14, 80, 30
Target: 100

We have four numbers. This means we will have three operations.
The numbers are relatively large, and the target is also a round number.
We have a 14 and a 28, which are related (28 = 2 * 14). This might be useful.
We have 80 and 30, which are also relatively large.

Let's try to combine numbers in pairs first and see if we can get closer to 100.

Possible combinations of two numbers:
28 + 14 = 42
28 - 14 = 14
28 * 14 = 392 (too large)
28 / 14 = 2

80 + 30 = 110
80 - 30 = 50
80 * 30 = 2400 (too large)
80 / 30 = 8/3 (fraction, might be tricky)

28 + 80 = 108
28 - 80 = -52
28 * 80 = 2240 (too large)
28 / 80 = 7/20

28 + 30 = 58
28 - 30 = -2
28 * 30 = 840 (too large)
28 / 30 = 14/15

14 + 80 = 94
14 - 80 = -66
14 * 80 = 1120 (too large)
14 / 80 = 7/40

14 + 30 = 44
14 - 30 = -16
14 * 30 = 420 (too large)
14 / 30 = 7/15

The division 28 / 14 = 2 seems promising as it gives a small integer.
If we use (28 / 14) = 2, we are left with 80 and 30.
We need to combine 2, 80, and 30 to get 100.
Possible combinations:
2 + 80 + 30 = 112 (close, but not 100)
2 + 80 - 30 = 52
2 - 80 + 30 = -48
2 - 80 - 30 = -108
2 * 80 + 30 = 160 + 30 = 190
2 * 80 - 30 = 160 - 30 = 130
2 + 80 * 30 = 2 + 2400 = 2402
2 - 80 * 30 = 2 - 2400 = -2398
(2 + 80) * 30 = 82 * 30 = 2460
(2 - 80) * 30 = -78 * 30 = -2340
2 * (80 + 30) = 2 * 110 = 220
2 * (80 - 30) = 2 * 50 = 100. This works!

So, the combination is (28 / 14) * (80 - 30).
Let's check:
(28 / 14) = 2
(80 - 30) = 50
2 * 50 = 100.

This equation uses all numbers [28, 14, 80, 30] exactly once and results in 100.
The operations used are division, subtraction, and multiplication.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
What if we try to get a number close to 100 using two numbers and then adjust with the other two?

Consider 80. We need to add 20.
Can we get 20 from 28, 14, 30?
28 - 14 + 30 = 14 + 30 = 44 (no)
28 + 14 - 30 = 42 - 30 = 12 (no)
28 * 14 / 30 (fraction)
28 / 14 * 30 = 2 * 30 = 60 (no)
(28 - 14) * 30 = 14 * 30 = 420 (no)
(28 + 14) * 30 = 42 * 30 = 1260 (no)
30 - (28 - 14) = 30 - 14 = 16 (no)
30 - (28 / 14) = 30 - 2 = 28 (no)
(30 - 28) * 14 = 2 * 14 = 28 (no)
(30 + 28) - 14 = 58 - 14 = 44 (no)
(30 - 14) + 28 = 16 + 28 = 44 (no)

Consider 30. We need to add 70.
Can we get 70 from 28, 14, 80?
80 - (28 - 14) = 80 - 14 = 66 (close)
80 - (28 / 14) = 80 - 2 = 78 (no)
80 - 14 + 28 = 66 + 28 = 94 (no)
80 + 14 - 28 = 94 - 28 = 66 (close)
80 - 28 + 14 = 52 + 14 = 66 (close)
(80 - 14) + 28 = 66 + 28 = 94 (no)
(80 + 14) - 28 = 94 - 28 = 66 (no)
(80 - 28) + 14 = 52 + 14 = 66 (no)
(80 / 14) * 28 (fraction)
(80 - 14) * (28 / ?) - not enough numbers.

Let's go back to the successful attempt: (28 / 14) * (80 - 30).
This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities systematically.
We have numbers A=28, B=14, C=80, D=30. Target T=100.

Possible structures:
1. ((A op B) op C) op D
2. ((A op B) op (C op D))
3. (A op (B op C)) op D
4. A op ((B op C) op D)
5. A op (B op (C op D))

Let's try structure 2: ((A op B) op (C op D))
We already found (28 / 14) * (80 - 30) = 2 * 50 = 100. This fits this structure.

Let's try other pairings for (C op D):
80 + 30 = 110. We need to get 100 from (A op B) op 110.
If (A op B) is 28/14 = 2, then 2 op 110.
2 + 110 = 112
2 - 110 = -108
2 * 110 = 220
2 / 110 (fraction)

80 - 30 = 50. We need to get 100 from (A op B) op 50.
If (A op B) is 28/14 = 2, then 2 op 50.
2 * 50 = 100. Found it again.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 92, 61, 6, and 27 exactly once, with the result being 30. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: [92, 61, 6, 27]
Target: 30

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers 92 and 61 are quite large. 27 and 6 are smaller.
The target 30 is relatively small. This suggests that subtraction or division might be important to reduce the larger numbers.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(92 - 61) = 31. This is very close to 30.
Now I have 31 and the remaining numbers are 6 and 27.
Can I combine 31, 6, and 27 to get 30?
If I have 31, I need to subtract 1.
Can I get 1 from 6 and 27?
27 / 6 is not an integer.
27 - 6 = 21.
6 - 27 is negative.
6 * 27 is large.
So, (92 - 61) = 31 doesn't seem to lead to a simple solution with the remaining numbers.

Possibility 2: Try combining other pairs first.
What if I try to get a number close to 30 directly?
Maybe 27 + 6 = 33. Remaining numbers are 92 and 61.
Can I combine 33, 92, and 61 to get 30?
33 - (92 - 61) = 33 - 31 = 2. Not 30.
33 + (92 - 61) = 33 + 31 = 64. Not 30.
(92 - 61) - 33 = 31 - 33 = -2. Not 30.

What if I use division to reduce a large number?
92 / 6 is not an integer.
92 / 27 is not an integer.
61 / 6 is not an integer.
61 / 27 is not an integer.
27 / 6 is not an integer.

Let's try to create a number that, when combined with others, results in 30.
Maybe I can create a number slightly larger than 30 and subtract something.
Or a number slightly smaller than 30 and add something.

Let's look at the numbers again: [92, 61, 6, 27]. Target: 30.

Consider the structure of the equation. It will likely involve parentheses.

Let's try to make a number around 30 using two numbers, then adjust with the other two.
Example: 27 + 6 = 33. Need to get -3 from 92 and 61. (61 - 92) = -31. (92 - 61) = 31. No.

What if I try to make a number that divides nicely?
For example, if I could make 60, then 60 / 2 = 30. But I don't have 2.

Let's try to make a number that, when added to or subtracted from another number, gives 30.
Suppose I have X and Y, and X + Y = 30.
Or X - Y = 30.
Or Y - X = 30.

Let's try to make a number that is a multiple of one of the smaller numbers.
For example, if I can make 180, then 180 / 6 = 30.
Can I make 180 from 92, 61, 27?
92 + 61 + 27 = 180.
So, (92 + 61 + 27) / 6 = 180 / 6 = 30.
This uses all numbers [92, 61, 27, 6] exactly once.
The operations are +, +, /.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's double check:
Numbers used: 92, 61, 27, 6. All used once.
Operations used: +, +, /. Basic arithmetic operations.
Result: (92 + 61 + 27) / 6 = (153 + 27) / 6 = 180 / 6 = 30.
Target value: 30.

This seems correct.

Let's consider if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one is quite straightforward.
What if I tried to make 30 using multiplication?
For example, 5 * 6 = 30. Can I make 5 from 92, 61, 27?
(92 - 61) = 31. Not 5.
(61 - 27) = 34. Not 5.
(92 - 27) = 65. Not 5.
(92 + 61) = 153.
(92 + 27) = 119.
(61 + 27) = 88.
(92 / ?)
(61 / ?)
(27 / ?)

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by 27, gives something useful.
Or multiplied by 6.

Let's go back to the first idea: (92 - 61) = 31. Remaining: 6, 27. Target: 30.
We need to get -1 from 6 and 27.
Can we do (6 - 27) / ? No.
Can we do 6 - (something with 27)?
Can we do 27 - (something with 6)?

Let's try another approach.
Maybe combine 92 and 27 first.
92 - 27 = 65. Remaining: 61, 6. Target: 30.
Can we get 30 from 65, 61, 6?
65 - 61 = 4. Then 4 and 6. 4+6=10, 6-4=2, 4*6=24, 6/4 not integer. No.
65 + 61 = 126. Then 126 and 6. No.
61 - 65 = -4. Then -4 and 6. No.

Maybe combine 92 and 6.
92 - 6 = 86. Remaining: 61, 27. Target: 30.
Can we get 30 from 86, 61, 27?
86 - 61 = 25. Then 25 and 27. 25+27=52, 27-25=2, 25*27 large. No.
86 - 27 = 59. Then 59 and 61. 61-59=2. No.

Maybe combine 61 and 27.
61 - 27 = 34. Remaining: 92, 6. Target: 30.
Can we get 30 from 34, 92, 6?
34 - 6 = 28. Then 28 and 92. No.

This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there's a solution involving subtraction of a larger number from a smaller number, which would require negative intermediate results if not handled carefully. However, the problem states basic arithmetic operations, implying standard order of operations or explicit parentheses.

Let's try to make a number that, when subtracted from 92, gives something useful.

I can only use the four basic operations: +, -, *, /.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 66, 66, 88.
Target: 89.

Possible combinations and operations:

1.  Try using division first, as it can significantly change the magnitude.
    *   88 / 66 is not an integer. 88/66 = 4/3.
    *   66 / 66 = 1.
        *   If we have 1, we need to get 88 from the remaining 88.
        *   (66 / 66) + 88 = 1 + 88 = 89. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 66, 66, 88. All used exactly once.
Operations used: /, +. Allowed.
Result: 89. Correct.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, though the first one seems straightforward.

2.  Try multiplication.
    *   66 * 66 is too large.
    *   66 * 88 is too large.

3.  Try addition and subtraction.
    *   66 + 66 + 88 = 220 (too large)
    *   88 + 66 - 66 = 88 (not 89)
    *   88 - 66 + 66 = 88 (not 89)
    *   66 + 88 - 66 = 88 (not 89)

4.  Consider division with other numbers.
    *   88 / (66 + 66) = 88 / 132 (not integer)
    *   66 / (88 - 66) = 66 / 22 = 3. Then we have 3 and 66. 3 + 66 = 69. Not 89.
    *   66 / (88 + 66) = 66 / 154 (not integer)

The first solution found, (66 / 66) + 88 = 89, is the simplest and correct one.

The target value is 91.
The available numbers are [17, 20, 11, 26].
I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 17, 20, 11, 26
Target: 91

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to get 91.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are relatively small, and the target is moderately sized. Multiplication will likely be involved to increase the value.

Possible products of two numbers:
17 * 20 = 340 (too large, need to subtract a lot)
17 * 11 = 187 (too large)
17 * 26 = 442 (too large)
20 * 11 = 220 (too large)
20 * 26 = 520 (too large)
11 * 26 = 286 (too large)

This suggests that a large product might need to be divided or significantly reduced by subtraction.

Let's try combining three numbers first and then incorporating the fourth.

Consider products involving the largest numbers:
26 * 20 = 520. Remaining numbers are 17, 11.
520 - 17 - 11 = 492 (not 91)
520 - (17 + 11) = 520 - 28 = 492
520 / 17 (not integer)
520 / 11 (not integer)
520 / (17+11) = 520 / 28 (not integer)

26 * 17 = 442. Remaining numbers are 20, 11.
442 - 20 - 11 = 411
442 - (20 + 11) = 442 - 31 = 411
442 / 20 (not integer)
442 / 11 = 40.18... (not integer)

26 * 11 = 286. Remaining numbers are 20, 17.
286 - 20 - 17 = 249
286 - (20 + 17) = 286 - 37 = 249
286 / 20 (not integer)
286 / 17 (not integer)

20 * 17 = 340. Remaining numbers are 26, 11.
340 - 26 - 11 = 303
340 - (26 + 11) = 340 - 37 = 303
340 / 26 (not integer)
340 / 11 (not integer)

20 * 11 = 220. Remaining numbers are 26, 17.
220 - 26 - 17 = 177
220 - (26 + 17) = 220 - 43 = 177
220 / 26 (not integer)
220 / 17 (not integer)

17 * 11 = 187. Remaining numbers are 20, 26.
187 - 20 - 26 = 141
187 - (20 + 26) = 187 - 46 = 141
187 / 20 (not integer)
187 / 26 (not integer)

It seems direct multiplication of two numbers followed by subtraction of the others is not working.

Let's try division.
Maybe a large number divided by a smaller one, then combine with others.
26 / 11 (not integer)
26 / 17 (not integer)
20 / 11 (not integer)
20 / 17 (not integer)
17 / 11 (not integer)
11 / 17 (not integer)

This suggests that division might be the last operation, or it might involve a sum/difference that results in a divisible number.

Let's try to get close to 91.
What if we multiply two numbers and add/subtract the others?
(20 * 11) + 26 - 17 = 220 + 26 - 17 = 246 - 17 = 229 (too high)
(20 * 11) - 26 + 17 = 220 - 26 + 17 = 194 + 17 = 211 (too high)

(26 * 11) + 20 - 17 = 286 + 20 - 17 = 306 - 17 = 289 (too high)
(26 * 11) - 20 + 17 = 286 - 20 + 17 = 266 + 17 = 283 (too high)

(26 * 17) + 20 - 11 = 442 + 20 - 11 = 462 - 11 = 451 (too high)

Let's try a different structure. Maybe a sum/difference multiplied by something.
(20 + 11) * ? = 31 * ?
31 * 17 = 527 (too high)
31 * 26 = 806 (too high)

(26 + 11) * ? = 37 * ?
37 * 17 = 629 (too high)
37 * 20 = 740 (too high)

(26 + 20) * ? = 46 * ?
46 * 17 = 782 (too high)
46 * 11 = 506 (too high)

(20 - 11) * ? = 9 * ?
9 * 17 = 153 (too high)
9 * 26 = 234 (too high)

(26 - 11) * ? = 15 * ?
15 * 17 = 255 (too high)
15 * 20 = 300 (too high)

(26 - 20) * ? = 6 * ?
6 * 17 = 102. Remaining number is 11.
102 - 11 = 91. This looks promising!
The numbers used are 26, 20, 17, 11.
The operations are -, *, -.
Let's check the order of operations.
(26 - 20) * 17 - 11
= 6 * 17 - 11
= 102 - 11
= 91.

This equation uses all numbers [17, 20, 11, 26] exactly once.
The operations used are subtraction and multiplication.
The result is 91.

Let's verify the conditions:
1. Target value is 91. (Yes)
2. Use every number in [17, 20, 11, 26] exactly once. (Yes: 26, 20, 17, 11)
3. Allowed operations: +, -, *, /. (Yes: -, *)
4. No other commentary outside tags. (Will ensure this)

Let's try to find another one just to be sure or to explore alternatives.

What if division is involved?
Maybe something like (A * B + C) / D = 91 or A * B - C / D = 91.

Let's try to make a number divisible by one of the others.
Possible sums/differences:
17+20=37
17+11=28
17+26=43
20+11=31
20+26=46
11+26=37

20-17=3
11-17=-6
26-17=9
11-20=-9
26-20=6
11-26=-15

Let's see if any of these can be combined with the remaining numbers to form a multiple of one of the remaining numbers.

    *   90 / 2 = 45. Then I need to get from 45 to 27 using 65. 45 - 65 = -20 (not 27). 45 + 65 = 110 (not 27).

Let's verify this combination: (90 - 65) + 2.
*   90 - 65 = 25
*   25 + 2 = 27

This uses all numbers (90, 65, 2) exactly once and only uses allowed operations (+, -). The result is 27.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure, though the first one seems correct.

2.  **Try multiplication:**

5510,695,"<think>The target is 86. The numbers are 62, 48, 4, and 3.
I need to combine these numbers using +, -, *, / to get 86.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite spread out. 62 is close to 86.
Maybe 62 + something? 86 - 62 = 24.
Can I make 24 from 48, 4, and 3?
48 / (4 * 3) = 48 / 12 = 4. Not 24.

48 * 3 = 144. Too big.
4 * 3 = 12.

48 / 3 = 16.

Let's try starting with 48.
86 - 48 = 38. Can I make 38 from 62, 4, 3?
62 - (4 * 3) = 62 - 12 = 50.
62 - 4 * 3 = 62 - 12 = 50.
62 - 3 * 4 = 62 - 12 = 50.
62 + 4 + 3 = 69.
62 + 4 - 3 = 63.
62 + 3 - 4 = 61.
62 - 4 - 3 = 55.
62 / ? No.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe one of the numbers is multiplied by a combination of others.
If 62 is multiplied by something, it will be too big.
If 48 is multiplied by something, it will be too big.
If 4 is multiplied by something: 4 * x = 86. x = 21.5. Not possible with integers.
If 3 is multiplied by something: 3 * x = 86. Not possible with integers.

Let's try a combination like (a * b) + c + d or (a * b) - c - d.
Try (48 * 3) = 144.
144 - 62 = 82. Need 4 more. Can I get 4 from 4? Yes.
So, (48 * 3) - 62 + 4 = 144 - 62 + 4 = 82 + 4 = 86.
This uses all numbers: 48, 3, 62, 4.
The operations are *, -, +.

Let's check the order of operations.
(48 * 3) - 62 + 4
144 - 62 + 4
82 + 4
86.

This works.

Let's try another approach just to be sure.
Maybe (62 + 4) * something? 66 * ? No.
Maybe (62 - 4) * something? 58 * ? No.
Maybe (62 + 3) * something? 65 * ? No.
Maybe (62 - 3) * something? 59 * ? No.

Maybe (48 + 4) * something? 52 * ? No.
Maybe (48 - 4) * something? 44 * ? No.
Maybe (48 + 3) * something? 51 * ? No.
Maybe (48 - 3) * something? 45 * ? No.

Let's consider division.
Maybe (62 + 48) / something? 110 / ? No.
Maybe (62 - 48) / something? 14 / ? No.
Maybe (48 + 4) / something? 52 / ? No.
Maybe (48 - 4) / something? 44 / ? No.

Let's go back to the successful one: (48 * 3) - 62 + 4.
This is a valid solution.

Are there other possibilities?
What if 62 is part of a multiplication?
(62 * ?) No, too big.

What if 48 is part of a division?
(48 / 4) = 12.
Can I make 86 from 12, 62, 3?
12 + 62 + 3 = 77.
12 + 62 - 3 = 71.
12 - 62 + 3 = -47.
62 + 3 = 65. 12 + 65 = 77.
62 - 3 = 59. 12 + 59 = 71.
62 * 3 = 186. 12 + 186 = 198.
12 * 62 = 744.
12 * 3 = 36. 62 + 36 = 98.
62 - 36 = 26.

(48 / 3) = 16.
Can I make 86 from 16, 62, 4?
16 + 62 + 4 = 82. Close.
16 + 62 - 4 = 74.
16 - 62 + 4 = -42.
62 + 4 = 66. 16 + 66 = 82.
62 - 4 = 58. 16 + 58 = 74.
62 * 4 = 248. 16 + 248 = 264.
16 * 62 = 992.
16 * 4 = 64. 62 + 64 = 126.
62 - 64 = -2.

Let's re-examine 16 + 62 + 4 = 82. We need 86.
This means we need to increase the sum by 4.
The numbers are 16 (from 48/3), 62, 4.
We used 48, 3, 62, 4.
The expression was (48/3) + 62 + 4 = 82.
We need to get 86.

Let's try the first solution again.
(48 * 3) - 62 + 4 = 144 - 62 + 4 = 82 + 4 = 86.
This is correct.

Let's try another structure.

(62 + 3) * ? = 65 * ? No.

So, (85 - 80) + (26 + 42) = 5 + 68 = 73 (Not 100)
(85 - 80) + (42 - 26) = 5 + 16 = 21 (Not 100)

Consider 80. We need 20 more. Can we get 20 from 85, 26, 42?
85 - 26 - 42 = 85 - 68 = 17 (Close, but not 20)

Let's try division.

What if we try to make 100 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others?
Let's try to make 100 using 26 and 42.

Consider 80. If we multiply it by something, it will get large quickly.

For example, if we can make 2, then 85 * 2 = 170 (too high). 80 * 2 = 160 (too high). 26 * 2 = 52. 42 * 2 = 84.

If we have 42 * 2 = 84, we need 16 from 85, 80, 26.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 94, 2, 51, and 17, with each number used exactly once, and only the operations +, -, *, /. The target result is 93.

Let's list the numbers: [94, 2, 51, 17]
Target: 93

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to reach 93.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 94.
How can I get close to 93 using the other numbers?
94 - 1 = 93. Can I make 1 from [2, 51, 17]?
(51 / 17) = 3. Then 2. Can't make 1.
(51 - 17) = 34. Then 2. Can't make 1.
(51 + 17) = 68. Then 2. Can't make 1.
(17 / 2) is not an integer.
(51 / 2) is not an integer.

Let's try to get 93 directly.
Maybe a large multiplication is involved?
If I multiply two numbers, what are the possibilities?
94 * 2 = 188
94 * 51 = too large
94 * 17 = too large
2 * 51 = 102
2 * 17 = 34
51 * 17 = too large

Let's consider 102.
102 - ? = 93. The difference is 9.
Can I make 9 from [94, 17]? No.
Can I make 9 from [94, 2]? No.
Can I make 9 from [94, 51]? No.
Can I make 9 from [17, 2]? No.
Can I make 9 from [51, 2]? No.
Can I make 9 from [51, 17]? No.

Let's consider 34.
34 + ? = 93. The difference is 59.
Can I make 59 from [94, 51, 17]?
94 - 51 = 43. Then 17. 43 + 17 = 60. Close. 43 - 17 = 26.
94 - 17 = 77. Then 51. 77 - 51 = 26. 77 + 51 = 128.
51 + 17 = 68. Then 94. 94 - 68 = 26.
51 - 17 = 34. Then 94. 94 - 34 = 60.

Let's try combining three numbers first.
(94 + 2) = 96. Remaining: [51, 17]. 96 - 51 = 45. 45 + 17 = 62. 45 - 17 = 28. 96 + 51 = 147. 147 - 17 = 130.
(94 - 2) = 92. Remaining: [51, 17]. 92 + 51 = 143. 92 - 51 = 41. 92 + 17 = 109. 92 - 17 = 75.
(94 * 2) = 188. Remaining: [51, 17]. 188 - 51 = 137. 188 - 17 = 171.
(94 / 2) = 47. Remaining: [51, 17]. 47 + 51 = 98. 98 - 17 = 81. 47 - 51 = -4. 47 + 17 = 64. 47 - 17 = 30.

(51 + 17) = 68. Remaining: [94, 2]. 68 + 94 = 162. 68 - 94 = -26. 68 * 2 = 136. 68 / 2 = 34.
(51 - 17) = 34. Remaining: [94, 2]. 34 + 94 = 128. 34 - 94 = -60. 34 * 2 = 68. 34 / 2 = 17.
(51 * 17) = 867. Too large.
(51 / 17) = 3. Remaining: [94, 2]. 3 + 94 = 97. 97 - 2 = 95. Close! 3 - 94 = -91. 3 * 94 = 282. 3 + 2 = 5. 3 - 2 = 1. 3 * 2 = 6.

Let's re-examine (51 / 17) = 3. Remaining [94, 2].
We got 97 - 2 = 95.
What about 94 + 3 - 2 = 95.
What about 94 - 3 + 2 = 93. This works!
The numbers used are 94, 3 (from 51/17), and 2.
So the equation is 94 - (51 / 17) + 2 = 93.
Let's check the order of operations.
94 - (51 / 17) + 2
94 - 3 + 2
91 + 2
93.

This uses all numbers [94, 2, 51, 17] exactly once.
Operations used: -, /, +.

Let's try another path to confirm.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 93.
Or (A + B) * C - D = 93.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 93 and subtract.
(51 * 2) = 102. Remaining [94, 17].
102 - ? = 93. We need to subtract 9.
Can we make 9 from [94, 17]? No.

Let's try to get a number slightly smaller than 93 and add.
(17 * 2) = 34. Remaining [94, 51].
34 + ? = 93. We need to add 59.
Can we make 59 from [94, 51]?
94 - 51 = 43. No.
94 + 51 = 145. No.

Let's go back to the successful one: 94 - (51 / 17) + 2 = 93.
This seems correct and valid.

Let's consider other groupings for 94 - (51 / 17) + 2.
Is it possible that the order of operations matters in a way that requires parentheses?
The expression is 94 - (51 / 17) + 2.
Division first: 51 / 17 = 3.
Then subtraction: 94 - 3 = 91.
Then addition: 91 + 2 = 93.
This is the standard order of operations.

What if we tried to group differently?
(94 - (51 / 17)) + 2 = 93. This is the same.
94 - ((51 / 17) + 2) = 94 - (3 + 2) = 94 - 5 = 89. Incorrect.
(94 - 51) / 17 + 2 = 43 / 17 + 2. Not integer.
94 - 51 / (17 + 2) = 94 - 51 / 19. Not integer.

The equation 94 - (51 / 17) + 2 = 93 is the most straightforward interpretation.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe the 94 is not the first number.
Let's try starting with 51.
51 + ? = 93. Need 42. Can we make 42 from [94, 2, 17]?

1421,1464,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 69, 35, 5, and 19 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 80.

Let's list the numbers: {69, 35, 5, 19}.
The target is 80.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. The order of operations matters, so I'll need to consider parentheses.

Let's try some initial combinations and see if they lead anywhere near 80.

Attempt 1: Simple additions and subtractions.
69 + 35 + 5 + 19 = 128 (Too high)
69 + 35 + 5 - 19 = 90 (Close, but not 80)
69 + 35 - 5 + 19 = 118 (Too high)
69 + 35 - 5 - 19 = 80 (This works! Let's check if all numbers are used and operations are valid.)
Numbers used: 69, 35, 5, 19. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, -. All valid.
Equation: 69 + 35 - 5 - 19 = 80.
Let's verify: 69 + 35 = 104. 104 - 5 = 99. 99 - 19 = 80.
This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to ensure I've considered enough.

Attempt 2: Incorporating multiplication.
Maybe multiplication can help reduce larger numbers or increase smaller ones strategically.

Consider (69 + 35) * ... This will likely be too large. (104 * ...)
Consider (69 - 35) * ... = 34 * ...
Consider (35 - 19) * ... = 16 * ...
Consider (19 - 5) * ... = 14 * ...

Let's try multiplying two numbers and then combining with the others.
Possibility 2a: Multiply 5 and 19.
5 * 19 = 95.
Now I have {69, 35, 95} and need to get 80.
69 + 35 - 95 = 104 - 95 = 9 (Not 80)
69 - 35 + 95 = 34 + 95 = 129 (Not 80)
35 - 69 + 95 = -34 + 95 = 61 (Not 80)
This path doesn't seem fruitful.

Possibility 2b: Multiply 5 and 35.
5 * 35 = 175.
Now I have {69, 19, 175} and need to get 80.
This seems unlikely to reach 80 with these numbers. 175 is already much larger than 80.

Possibility 2c: Multiply 5 and 69.
5 * 69 = 345. Too large.

Possibility 2d: Multiply 19 and 35.
19 * 35 = 665. Too large.

Possibility 2e: Multiply 19 and 69.
19 * 69 = 1311. Too large.

Possibility 2f: Multiply 35 and 69.
35 * 69 = 2415. Too large.

It seems direct multiplication of two numbers leads to values that are too large to easily combine with the remaining two to get 80.

Let's consider division.

Attempt 3: Incorporating division.
Maybe dividing a larger number by a smaller one can help.

Possibility 3a: 69 / 35 (Not an integer)
Possibility 3b: 69 / 5 (Not an integer)
Possibility 3c: 69 / 19 (Not an integer)
Possibility 3d: 35 / 5 = 7.
Now I have {69, 19, 7} and need to get 80.
69 + 19 - 7 = 88 - 7 = 81 (Close!)
69 - 19 + 7 = 50 + 7 = 57 (Not 80)
19 - 69 + 7 = -50 + 7 = -43 (Not 80)
Let's re-evaluate 69 + 19 - 7 = 81. The equation would be 69 + 19 - (35 / 5) = 81. This is not 80.

Possibility 3e: 35 / 19 (Not an integer)
Possibility 3f: 19 / 5 (Not an integer)
Possibility 3g: 5 / 19 (Not an integer)

What if the division is part of a larger expression?
Consider (69 + 19) / ... = 88 / ...
Consider (69 - 19) / ... = 50 / ...
Consider (35 + 5) / ... = 40 / ...
Consider (35 - 5) / ... = 30 / ...

Let's try (35 + 5) / 5. This uses 35 and 5 twice, which is not allowed.

Let's go back to the successful attempt: 69 + 35 - 5 - 19 = 80.
This uses all numbers {69, 35, 5, 19} exactly once.
It uses only allowed operations +, -, -.
The calculation is correct: 69 + 35 = 104, 104 - 5 = 99, 99 - 19 = 80.

Let's try to see if there are other ways to arrange these numbers and operations to get 80.
What if we use parentheses differently?

Consider (69 + 35) - (5 + 19) = 104 - 24 = 80.
Numbers used: 69, 35, 5, 19. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, +. All valid.
This is another valid solution.

Consider (69 - 5) + (35 - 19) = 64 + 16 = 80.
Numbers used: 69, 5, 35, 19. All used once.
Operations used: -, +, -. All valid.
This is another valid solution.

Consider (69 - 19) + (35 - 5) = 50 + 30 = 80.
Numbers used: 69, 19, 35, 5. All used once.
Operations used: -, +, -. All valid.
This is another valid solution.

The problem asks for *a* mathematical equation. I have found several. The first one I found was 69 + 35 - 5 - 19 = 80. This is the simplest in terms of parenthesis usage.

Let's try to force a multiplication or division.
We saw 35 / 5 = 7.
We had 69 + 19 - 7 = 81.
What if we try to get 80 using 7 and the remaining numbers {69, 19}?
We need to combine 69, 19, and 7 to get 80.
69 + 19 - 7 = 81.
69 - 19 + 7 = 57.
19 - 69 + 7 = -43.
69 + 7 - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57.
19 + 7 - 69 = 26 - 69 = -43.
7 + 69 - 19 = 76 - 19 = 57.
7 + 19 - 69 = 26 - 69 = -43.

What if we try to get 80 using multiplication with 5?
Let's try to make one part of the equation equal to 16, so 5 * 16 = 80.
Can we make 16 using {69, 35, 19}?
69 - 35 - 19 = 34 - 19 = 15 (Close)
35 - 19 = 16.
So, we can have 5 * (35 - 19) = 5 * 16 = ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers 75, 70, 95, and 62 exactly once.
The allowed operations are +, -, *, /.
The target result is 59.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible combinations and operations:

1.  Try multiplication first, as it can quickly change the magnitude.
    *   75 * 70 is too large.
    *   75 * 95 is too large.
    *   75 * 62 is too large.
    *   70 * 95 is too large.
    *   70 * 62 is too large.
    *   95 * 62 is too large.

2.  Try division.
    *   75 / 70 (not an integer)
    *   75 / 95 (not an integer)
    *   75 / 62 (not an integer)
    *   70 / 75 (not an integer)
    *   70 / 95 (not an integer)
    *   70 / 62 (not an integer)
    *   95 / 75 (not an integer)

    *   62 / 75 (not an integer)
    *   62 / 70 (not an integer)
    *   62 / 95 (not an integer)

    This suggests that division might be used at the end, or on numbers that result in integers. Or perhaps division is not the primary operation.

3.  Let's try combining numbers with addition and subtraction first, then see if multiplication/division can adjust.
    Target: 59

    Numbers: [75, 70, 95, 62]

    Try grouping:
    *   (75 + 70) = 145

    *   (70 - 75) = -5
    *   (75 + 95) = 170
    *   (95 - 75) = 20
    *   (75 + 62) = 137
    *   (75 - 62) = 13

    *   (70 + 95) = 165
    *   (95 - 70) = 25

    *   (95 + 62) = 157
    *   (95 - 62) = 33
    *   (62 - 95) = -33

    Let's try to get close to 59.
    *   95 - 62 = 33. Remaining numbers: [75, 70]. We need to get 59 - 33 = 26 from 75 and 70.
        *   75 + 70 = 145 (too big)

        *   75 / 70 (not integer)
        *   70 / 75 (not integer)
        So, (95 - 62) + (75 - 70) = 33 + 5 = 38 (not 59)
        So, (95 - 62) + (70 - 75) = 33 - 5 = 28 (not 59)

    *   75 - 62 = 13. Remaining numbers: [70, 95]. We need to get 59 - 13 = 46 from 70 and 95.
        *   70 + 95 = 165 (too big)
        *   95 - 70 = 25 (too small)
        *   70 - 95 = -25 (too small)
        *   70 * 95 (too big)
        *   70 / 95 (not integer)
        *   95 / 70 (not integer)
        So, (75 - 62) + (95 - 70) = 13 + 25 = 38 (not 59)

    *   70 - 62 = 8. Remaining numbers: [75, 95]. We need to get 59 - 8 = 51 from 75 and 95.
        *   75 + 95 = 170 (too big)
        *   95 - 75 = 20 (too small)
        *   75 - 95 = -20 (too small)
        *   75 * 95 (too big)
        *   75 / 95 (not integer)
        *   95 / 75 (not integer)
        So, (70 - 62) + (95 - 75) = 8 + 20 = 28 (not 59)

    Let's try multiplication with one of the smaller results.
    *   (75 - 70) = 5. Remaining: [95, 62]. We need to get 59 from 5, 95, 62.
        *   5 * 95 = 475 (too big)
        *   5 * 62 = 310 (too big)

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 94.
- 94 - ? = 46. This means ? = 94 - 46 = 48. Can I make 48 from 40 and 8? Yes, 40 + 8 = 48.
So, 94 - (40 + 8) = 94 - 48 = 46. This uses all numbers and is a valid expression.

Let's check other possibilities to be thorough, though the first one seems promising.

Possibility 2: Start with 40.
- 40 + ? = 46. This means ? = 6. Can I make 6 from 94 and 8?
  - 94 + 8 = 102 (too big)
  - 94 - 8 = 86 (too big)
  - 94 * 8 (too big)
  - 94 / 8 (not an integer, and unlikely to result in 6)
  So, this path doesn't seem to work easily.

Possibility 3: Start with 8.

  - 40 + 94 = 134
  - 40 - 94 = -54
  - 94 - 40 = 54
  - 40 * 94 (too big)
  - 40 / 94 (fraction)
  - 94 / 40 (fraction)
  So, this path doesn't seem to work.

Let's revisit Possibility 1: 94 - (40 + 8).
This uses 94, 40, and 8 exactly once.
The operations are subtraction and addition.
The result is 94 - 48 = 46.
This is a valid solution.

Are there any other ways to combine 40 and 8 to get 48? No, only addition works.
What if we used multiplication or division with 94?
- 94 * ? = 46 (unlikely with integers)
- 94 / ? = 46 (unlikely with integers)

What if we combined 40 and 8 first in a different way?
- 40 * 8 = 320. Then use 94. 320 + 94, 320 - 94, 94 - 320, 320 * 94, 320 / 94, 94 / 320. None seem to lead to 46.
- 40 / 8 = 5. Then use 94.
  - 94 + 5 = 99
  - 94 - 5 = 89
  - 5 - 94 = -89
  - 94 * 5 = 470
  - 94 / 5 (fraction)
  - 5 / 94 (fraction)
  None lead to 46.
- 40 - 8 = 32. Then use 94.

  - 94 - 32 = 62
  - 32 - 94 = -62
  - 94 * 32 (too big)
  - 94 / 32 (fraction)
  - 32 / 94 (fraction)
  None lead to 46.
- 8 - 40 = -32. Then use 94.
  - 94 + (-32) = 62
  - 94 - (-32) = 126
  - (-32) - 94 = -126
  - 94 * (-32) (negative)
  - 94 / (-32) (fraction)
  - (-32) / 94 (fraction)
  None lead to 46.

The initial solution 94 - (40 + 8) = 46 seems to be the most straightforward and correct.
Let's consider if there are other ways to group.
(94 - 40) + 8 = 54 + 8 = 62 (not 46)
(94 + 8) - 40 = 102 - 40 = 62 (not 46)
94 + (8 - 40) = 94 + (-32) = 62 (not 46)

4916,802,"<think>The numbers are [92, 61, 6, 27] and the target is 30. I need to use each number exactly once with basic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's try to combine the numbers.
The numbers are quite large, so division or subtraction might be useful to reduce them.

Possible combinations:
- Try to get a number close to 30 and then adjust.
- Try to create multiples of 30 or numbers that can easily lead to 30.

Let's look at the numbers: 92, 61, 6, 27.
The sum is 92 + 61 + 6 + 27 = 186. This is far from 30.
The product is 92 * 61 * 6 * 27, which is very large.

Let's try to use subtraction to reduce the large numbers.
92 - 61 = 31. This is very close to 30.
If we have 31, we need to use 6 and 27 to get -1.
Can we get -1 from 6 and 27?
6 - 27 = -21 (not -1)
27 - 6 = 21 (not -1)
6 / 27 (fraction)
27 / 6 (fraction)
6 * 27 (large)

So, (92 - 61) doesn't seem to lead directly to 30 with the remaining numbers.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe we can create a number that divides into another number to get a smaller result.
Or maybe we can create a number that, when added/subtracted from a large number, gets us closer.

Consider 92 and 61.
92 + 61 = 153
92 - 61 = 31
61 - 92 = -31
92 * 61 = 5612
92 / 61 (fraction)
61 / 92 (fraction)

Consider 27 and 6.
27 + 6 = 33
27 - 6 = 21
6 - 27 = -21
27 * 6 = 162
27 / 6 = 4.5
6 / 27 (fraction)

Let's try to combine the larger numbers first.
What if we try to make a number that, when operated with 6 or 27, gets us to 30?

If we have 24, then 24 + 6 = 30. Can we make 24 from 92, 61, 27?
92 - 61 - 27 = 31 - 27 = 4 (not 24)
92 - (61 + 27) = 92 - 88 = 4 (not 24)
(92 + 27) - 61 = 119 - 61 = 58 (not 24)

If we have 3, then 3 * (something) = 30, so something = 10. Can we make 10 from 92, 61, 27?
92 - 61 - 27 = 4 (not 10)
(92 + 27) - 61 = 58 (not 10)

If we have 36, then 36 - 6 = 30. Can we make 36 from 92, 61, 27?
92 - 61 + 27 = 31 + 27 = 58 (not 36)
(92 + 61) - 27 = 153 - 27 = 126 (not 36)

Let's try to use division to reduce the numbers.
Maybe we can divide a large number by a combination of others.

Consider 92.
Can we get 30 by adding/subtracting/multiplying 61, 6, 27 to 92?
92 + 61 + 6 + 27 = 186
92 - 61 - 6 - 27 = 92 - 94 = -2
92 + 61 - 6 - 27 = 153 - 33 = 120
92 - 61 + 6 + 27 = 31 + 33 = 64
92 + 61 + 6 - 27 = 159 - 27 = 132
92 + 61 - (6 + 27) = 153 - 33 = 120
92 - (61 + 6 + 27) = 92 - 94 = -2

Let's try to make a number that can be divided by 6 or 27.
Or a number that can divide 92 or 61.

What if we try to make a number that, when multiplied by 6, gets us close to 30?
If we have 5, then 5 * 6 = 30. Can we make 5 from 92, 61, 27?
92 - 61 - 27 = 4 (close)
(92 + 27) - 61 = 58
(61 + 27) - 92 = 88 - 92 = -4

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by 27, gets us close to 30. Not likely.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by 6, gets us close to 30.
If we have 180, then 180 / 6 = 30. Can we make 180 from 92, 61, 27?
92 + 61 + 27 = 180. Yes!
So, (92 + 61 + 27) / 6 = 180 / 6 = 30.
This uses all numbers exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's verify:
Numbers: [92, 61, 6, 27]
Target: 30
Equation: (92 + 61 + 27) / 6

Step 1: 92 + 61 = 153

    *   61 - 84 = -23 (close, but not -29)
    *   84 - 61 = 23
    *   61 * 84 (too big)

*   84 + 26 = 110. Remaining: [61, 94]. Can I get 91 - 110 = -19 from 61 and 94?

        *   (61 + 26) - 84 = 87 - 84 = 3. So, 94 - ((61 + 26) - 84) = 94 - 3 = 91.
        This uses 94, 61, 26, 84. Operations: *, -, +, -.
        Let's verify: 94 - (87 - 84) = 94 - 3 = 91. This is also a valid solution.

        This uses 84, 94, 61, 26. Operations: +, -, -, -.
        Let's verify: 84 + (33 - 26) = 84 + 7 = 91. This is also a valid solution.

*   61 * ?
    *   61 * 1 = 61. Need to get 91 - 61 = 30 from [94, 84, 26].

        *   (26 / 94) (fraction)
        *   (94 / 84) (fraction)

Let's try division.
*   94 / 2 = 47. Can I get 91 from [61, 84, 26] and 47? No, 2 is not available.

Let's go back to the first solution found as it's simple and uses only subtraction and addition.
(94 - 61) + (84 - 26) = 33 + 58 = 91.

Let's check the second solution: 94 - ((61 + 26) - 84) = 94 - (87 - 84) = 94 - 3 = 91.
This is also valid.

Let's check the third solution: 84 + (94 - 61 - 26) = 84 + (33 - 26) = 84 + 7 = 91.
This is also valid.

The prompt asks for *an* arithmetic equation. The first one is clear and straightforward.
(94 - 61) + (84 - 26)

Let's re-read the prompt carefully: ""construct an arithmetic equation. This equation must utilize all numbers provided in [61 94 84 26] exactly once, and its final calculated value must precisely match 91. You are permitted to use standard operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). ""

The first solution (94 - 61) + (84 - 26) = 91 fits all criteria.
Numbers used: 94, 61, 84, 26 (all used once).
Operations used: -, +, -.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 45, 38, and 28, with only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to equal 55. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [45, 38, 28]
Target: 55

I need to try different combinations of operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 55
2. a op (b op c) = 55

Let's try combining 45 and 38 first.
- 45 + 38 = 83. 83 op 28 = 55?
    - 83 - 28 = 55. This works!
    - So, (45 + 38) - 28 = 55.

Let's verify:
- Numbers used: 45, 38, 28 (all used once)
- Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic)
- Result: (45 + 38) - 28 = 83 - 28 = 55.

This seems to be a valid solution. I should check if there are other possibilities, but this one is straightforward and meets all criteria.

Let's try other initial combinations just to be sure.
- 45 - 38 = 7. 7 op 28 = 55?
    - 7 + 28 = 35 (not 55)
    - 7 - 28 = -21 (not 55)

    - 7 / 28 = 0.25 (not 55)
- 45 * 38 = 1710. 1710 op 28 = 55? Unlikely with subtraction or division.
- 45 / 38 = ~1.18. 1.18 op 28 = 55? Unlikely.

Let's try combining 38 and 28 first.
- 38 + 28 = 66. 66 op 45 = 55?
    - 66 - 45 = 21 (not 55)
    - 66 + 45 = 111 (not 55)
    - 66 * 45 = large (not 55)
    - 66 / 45 = ~1.46 (not 55)
- 38 - 28 = 10. 10 op 45 = 55?
    - 10 + 45 = 55. This works!
    - So, (38 - 28) + 45 = 55.
    - Let's verify: (38 - 28) + 45 = 10 + 45 = 55. This is also a valid solution.

- 38 * 28 = 1064. 1064 op 45 = 55? Unlikely.
- 38 / 28 = ~1.35. 1.35 op 45 = 55? Unlikely.

Let's try combining 45 and 28 first.
- 45 + 28 = 73. 73 op 38 = 55?
    - 73 - 38 = 35 (not 55)
    - 73 + 38 = 111 (not 55)
- 45 - 28 = 17. 17 op 38 = 55?
    - 17 + 38 = 55. This works!
    - So, (45 - 28) + 38 = 55.
    - Let's verify: (45 - 28) + 38 = 17 + 38 = 55. This is also a valid solution.

- 45 * 28 = 1260. 1260 op 38 = 55? Unlikely.
- 45 / 28 = ~1.6. 1.6 op 38 = 55? Unlikely.

I have found three valid solutions:
1. (45 + 38) - 28 = 55
2. (38 - 28) + 45 = 55
3. (45 - 28) + 38 = 55

The user wants an equation using the numbers [17, 4, 25, 68] exactly once, with only +, -, *, / operations, to equal 26.

Let's list the numbers: 17, 4, 25, 68.
The target is 26.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. I should consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Parentheses can be used to control the order.

Let's try to get close to 26.
The numbers are:
Small: 4, 17, 25
Large: 68

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest number (68) and try to reduce it.
2. Combine smaller numbers to get a value that can be combined with the larger numbers.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers close to 26 or factors of numbers that could lead to 26.

Let's explore combinations:

Attempt 1: Using 68 as a starting point.
68 / 4 = 17. Now I have 17, 17, 25. Can I get 26 from these?
17 + 17 = 34. 34 - 25 = 9. Not 26.
17 - 17 = 0. 0 + 25 = 25. Not 26.
17 * 17 = 289. Too large.
17 / 17 = 1. 1 + 25 = 26. This looks promising!
So, (68 / 4) / (17 / 17) = 17 / 1 = 17. This is not correct.
The numbers used are 68, 4, 17, 17. I need to use 17, 4, 25, 68.

Let's re-evaluate:
I used 68 / 4 = 17. The remaining numbers are 17 and 25.
I need to combine 17 and 25 with the result 17 to get 26.
So, I have the intermediate result 17, and the numbers 17 and 25.
Can I combine 17, 17, 25 to get 26?
(68 / 4) = 17. Remaining: 17, 25.
17 + 17 + 25 = 59
17 + 17 - 25 = 9
17 - 17 + 25 = 25
17 * 17 + 25 = 289 + 25 = 314
17 * 17 - 25 = 289 - 25 = 264
17 / 17 + 25 = 1 + 25 = 26.
This uses 17, 17, 25. The original numbers are 17, 4, 25, 68.
The expression would be (68 / 4) / (17 / 17) + 25. This is not right.
The expression would be (68 / 4) + (17 / 17) + 25. This uses 68, 4, 17, 17, 25. Still not right.

Let's try to use the numbers directly in an expression.
Numbers: 17, 4, 25, 68. Target: 26.

Consider the division 68 / 4 = 17.
Remaining numbers: 17, 25.
Can I combine 17, 25 with 17 to get 26?
(68 / 4) + 17 - 25 = 17 + 17 - 25 = 34 - 25 = 9. No.
(68 / 4) - 17 + 25 = 17 - 17 + 25 = 25. No.
(68 / 4) + 25 - 17 = 17 + 25 - 17 = 25. No.
(68 / 4) * (25 - 17) = 17 * 8 = 136. No.
(68 / 4) + (25 / 17) - not integer.

Let's try another division: 68 / 17 = 4.
Remaining numbers: 4, 25.
Can I combine 4, 25 with 4 to get 26?

3388,1275,"<think>The target number is 29. The given numbers are 56, 4, and 60. I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  Start with the largest number, 60.
    *   60 / 4 = 15. Then I have 56 left. 15 + 56 = 71 (too high). 56 - 15 = 41 (too high). 15 * 56 (way too high).
    *   60 - 4 = 56. Then I have 56 left. 56 + 56 = 112. 56 - 56 = 0. 56 * 56. 56 / 56 = 1.
    *   60 + 4 = 64. Then I have 56 left. 64 - 56 = 8. 64 + 56. 64 * 56. 64 / 56.
    *   60 * 4 = 240. Then I have 56 left. 240 - 56. 240 + 56. 240 / 56.

2.  Start with 56.
    *   56 / 4 = 14. Then I have 60 left. 60 - 14 = 46 (too high). 60 + 14 = 74. 14 * 60. 60 / 14.
    *   56 - 4 = 52. Then I have 60 left. 60 - 52 = 8. 60 + 52. 60 * 52. 60 / 52.
    *   56 + 4 = 60. Then I have 60 left. 60 - 60 = 0. 60 + 60. 60 * 60. 60 / 60 = 1.
    *   56 * 4 = 224. Then I have 60 left. 224 - 60. 224 + 60. 224 / 60.

3.  Let's try to get close to 29.
    *   Maybe a division that results in a number close to 29 or a number that can be combined with others to get 29.
    *   56 / 4 = 14. We need to get 29 from 14 and 60. 60 - 14 = 46. 60 + 14 = 74.
    *   What if we use 60 and 4 first?
        *   60 / 4 = 15. We have 56. 56 - 15 = 41. 56 + 15 = 71.
        *   60 - 4 = 56. We have 56. 56 - 56 = 0. 56 + 56 = 112.
        *   60 + 4 = 64. We have 56. 64 - 56 = 8.
        *   60 * 4 = 240. We have 56. 240 - 56 = 184.

    *   What if we use 56 and 60 first?
        *   60 - 56 = 4. We have 4. 4 + 4 = 8. 4 - 4 = 0. 4 * 4 = 16. 4 / 4 = 1.
        *   60 + 56 = 116. We have 4. 116 / 4 = 29. This looks promising!

Let's verify: (60 + 56) / 4
60 + 56 = 116
116 / 4 = 29

This uses 60, 56, and 4 exactly once and only uses addition and division.

Let's try another path to be sure.
What if we try to make a number that, when operated on with another, gives 29?
For example, if we can make 30 and subtract 1.
Or make 25 and add 4.
Or make 58 and divide by 2.

Let's re-examine (60 + 56) / 4.
Numbers used: 60, 56, 4. All used once.
Operations used: +, /. Standard arithmetic operations.
Result: 29.

This seems correct.

The problem asks me to find a mathematical equation using the numbers [34, 53, 73] and the operations [+,-,*,/] that evaluates to 92. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 34, 53, 73.
The target is 92.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the 4 types. This gives a large number of possibilities, but I can try to be systematic.

Let's consider the order of operations. Parentheses can be used to change the order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try permutations of the numbers and see if any combination works.

        *   Equation: 77 - 42 - (6 / 2) = 32.

Let's re-check the first solution found: 77 - (42 + 6/2) = 32.
This is equivalent to 77 - 42 - 6/2 = 32.

Both solutions are valid. I will present the one that seems slightly more straightforward in terms of order of operations.

Solution 1: 77 - (42 + 6/2) = 32
Solution 2: 77 - 42 - (6/2) = 32

Let's check if there are any other simple ones.
What if we use 2 to divide something larger?
(77 - 6) / 2 = 71/2 (No)
(42 - 6) / 2 = 36 / 2 = 18. Remaining: 77. Target: 32. 18 + 77 = 95. 77 - 18 = 59.
(77 + 42) / 2 = 119/2 (No)
(77 - 42) / 2 = 35/2 (No)

Let's stick with the first one found.
77 - (42 + 6/2) = 32
Numbers: 77, 42, 6, 2. Used once.
Operations: -, +, /. Allowed.
Result: 32. Correct.

The equation 77 - 42 - (6/2) = 32 is also valid and uses the same numbers and operations.
77 - 42 - 3 = 35 - 3 = 32.

I will use the first one found as it explicitly groups the addition before subtraction from 77.
77 - (42 + (6 / 2)) = 32
This is clear.

The problem requires me to use the numbers 66, 9, 10, and 34 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target number 99.

Let's list the numbers: [66, 9, 10, 34]
Target: 99

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. I can try different combinations and see if I can get close to 99.

Possible strategies:
1. Try to get a number close to 99 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting with the others.
2. Try to get a number that, when added to or subtracted from another combination, results in 99.
3. Consider division, but be mindful of integer division or non-integer results.

Let's explore some combinations:

Attempt 1: Multiplication first.
66 * 9 = 594 (Too large)
66 * 10 = 660 (Too large)
66 * 34 = 2244 (Too large)
9 * 10 = 90. Remaining numbers are 66 and 34.
   Can I get 9 from 66 and 34? 66 - 34 = 32. 66 + 34 = 100. 66 / 34 (not integer). 34 / 66 (not integer).
   So, 90 + (66 - 34) = 90 + 32 = 122 (Not 99)
   90 + (66 + 34) = 90 + 100 = 190 (Not 99)
   90 - (66 - 34) = 90 - 32 = 58 (Not 99)
   90 - (66 + 34) = 90 - 100 = -10 (Not 99)
   (66 - 34) - 90 = 32 - 90 = -58 (Not 99)
   (66 + 34) - 90 = 100 - 90 = 10 (Not 99)

9 * 34 = 306 (Too large)
10 * 34 = 340 (Too large)

Attempt 2: Try to get a number close to 99 by adding/subtracting.
66 + 34 = 100. Remaining numbers are 9 and 10.
   Can I get -1 from 9 and 10? 9 - 10 = -1.
   So, (66 + 34) + (9 - 10) = 100 + (-1) = 99.
   This looks promising! Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once and only allowed operations are used.
   Numbers used: 66, 34, 9, 10. All used once.
   Operations used: +, +, -. All allowed.
   The expression is (66 + 34) + (9 - 10).
   Let's evaluate: 100 + (-1) = 99. This is correct.

Let's try another combination just to be sure or to see if there are other solutions.

Attempt 3: Another combination.
Maybe start with 66 and try to add/subtract/multiply/divide with others to get 99.
66 + ? = 99 => ? = 33. Can I get 33 from 9, 10, 34?
   9 + 10 + 34 = 53
   9 * 10 + 34 = 90 + 34 = 124
   9 * 34 + 10 = 306 + 10 = 316
   10 * 34 + 9 = 340 + 9 = 349
   34 - 10 + 9 = 24 + 9 = 33. Yes!
   So, 66 + (34 - 10 + 9) = 66 + (24 + 9) = 66 + 33 = 99.
   Numbers used: 66, 34, 10, 9. All used once.
   Operations used: +, -, +. All allowed.
   The expression is 66 + (34 - 10 + 9).
   Let's evaluate: 66 + (24 + 9) = 66 + 33 = 99. This is also correct.

The problem asks for *a* valid mathematical expression. Both (66 + 34) + (9 - 10) and 66 + (34 - 10 + 9) are valid. I will present the first one I found.

Let's double check the first solution: (66 + 34) + (9 - 10)
Numbers: 66, 34, 9, 10. All used once.
Operations: +, +, -. All allowed.
Evaluation: (100) + (-1) = 99. Correct.

Let's consider the order of operations and parentheses.
(66 + 34) + (9 - 10) is clear.
If I wrote 66 + 34 + 9 - 10, it would also evaluate to 99 due to associativity of addition and subtraction.
66 + 34 = 100
100 + 9 = 109
109 - 10 = 99.
So, 66 + 34 + 9 - 10 is also a valid expression.

Let's check the second solution again: 66 + (34 - 10 + 9)
Numbers: 66, 34, 10, 9. All used once.
Operations: +, -, +. All allowed.
Evaluation: 66 + (24 + 9) = 66 + 33 = 99. Correct.

I will present the simplest form without unnecessary parentheses if possible, but ensuring correctness.
The expression 66 + 34 + 9 - 10 uses all numbers and operations correctly.

Let's try to see if division could be involved.
If I divide 66 by something, it's unlikely to lead to a simple integer that helps reach 99 with the other numbers.
66 / 9 (not integer)
66 / 10 (not integer)
66 / 34 (not integer)

What if I divide a combination?
(66 + 9) / ? = 75 / ?
(66 - 9) / ? = 57 / ?
(66 * 9) / ? = 594 / ?

Let's go back to the successful additive/subtractive combinations.
(66 + 34) + (9 - 10) = 99
66 + 34 + 9 - 10 = 99

Let's try to use multiplication in a different way.
Maybe one number is multiplied by a result of other operations.
Example: 9 * (something from 66, 10, 34)
9 * (66 + 10 + 34) = 9 * 110 = 990 (too big)
9 * (66 - 10 - 34) = 9 * (56 - 34) = 9 * 22 = 198 (too big)
9 * (66 + 10 - 34) = 9 * (76 - 34) = 9 * 42 = 378 (too big)
9 * (66 - 10 + 34) = 9 * (56 + 34) = 9 * 90 = 810 (too big)

What if the multiplication is not the first operation?
(66 + 9) * ? = 75 * ?
(66 - 9) * ? = 57 * ?
(66 + 10) * ? = 76 * ?
(66 - 10) * ? = 56 * ?
(66 + 34) * ? = 100 * ?
(66 - 34) * ? = 32 * ?

Let's consider the target 99. It's close to 100.
We found (66 + 34) = 100.
Then we need to get -1 from 9 and 10.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 63, 2, and 91 exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /, to result in 30.

Let's list the numbers: 63, 2, 91.
Target: 30.

Possible combinations of operations and numbers:

1.  **Start with the largest number (91) and try to reduce it.**
    *   91 - ? = 30. This means ? = 61. Can we make 61 from 63 and 2?
        *   63 + 2 = 65 (No)
        *   63 - 2 = 61 (Yes!)
        *   63 * 2 = 126 (No)
        *   63 / 2 = 31.5 (No)
        *   2 - 63 = -61 (No)
        *   2 / 63 (No)
    *   So, 91 - (63 - 2) = 91 - 61 = 30. This works!

2.  **Start with 63 and try to reach 30.**
    *   63 - ? = 30. This means ? = 33. Can we make 33 from 91 and 2?
        *   91 + 2 = 93 (No)
        *   91 - 2 = 89 (No)
        *   91 * 2 = 182 (No)
        *   91 / 2 = 45.5 (No)
        *   2 - 91 = -89 (No)
        *   2 / 91 (No)
    *   63 + ? = 30. This means ? = -33. Can we make -33 from 91 and 2? No, not with positive results from operations.
    *   63 * ? = 30. ? = 30/63 = 10/21. Can we make 10/21 from 91 and 2? No.
    *   63 / ? = 30. ? = 63/30 = 2.1. Can we make 2.1 from 91 and 2? No.

3.  **Start with 2 and try to reach 30.**
    *   2 + ? = 30. ? = 28. Can we make 28 from 63 and 91?
        *   91 - 63 = 28 (Yes!)
        *   So, 2 + (91 - 63) = 2 + 28 = 30. This also works!

4.  **Consider multiplication first.**
    *   63 * 2 = 126. Can we get 30 from 126 and 91?
        *   126 - 91 = 35 (Close, but no)
        *   91 - 126 = -35 (No)
        *   126 + 91 = 217 (No)
        *   126 / 91 (No)
        *   91 / 126 (No)
    *   63 * 91 (Too large)
    *   2 * 91 = 182. Can we get 30 from 182 and 63?
        *   182 - 63 = 119 (No)
        *   63 - 182 (No)
        *   182 + 63 (No)
        *   182 / 63 (No)
        *   63 / 182 (No)

5.  **Consider division first.**
    *   63 / 2 = 31.5. Can we get 30 from 31.5 and 91?
        *   31.5 - 91 (No)
        *   91 - 31.5 = 59.5 (No)
        *   31.5 + 91 (No)
        *   31.5 / 91 (No)
        *   91 / 31.5 (No)
    *   91 / 2 = 45.5. Can we get 30 from 45.5 and 63?
        *   45.5 - 63 (No)
        *   63 - 45.5 = 17.5 (No)
        *   45.5 + 63 (No)
        *   45.5 / 63 (No)
        *   63 / 45.5 (No)
    *   63 / 91 (No)
    *   91 / 63 (No)

We found two valid solutions:
1.  91 - (63 - 2) = 30
2.  2 + (91 - 63) = 30

Both use each number exactly once and only allowed operations. I will present one of them. The first one is slightly more direct in its reduction.

Let's double check the first solution:
Numbers: 63, 2, 91

Step 2: 91 - 61 = 30
This is correct.

Let's double check the second solution:
Numbers: 63, 2, 91
Operations: +, -
Equation: 2 + (91 - 63)
Step 1: 91 - 63 = 28
Step 2: 2 + 28 = 30

Factors of 52 are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, 52.

Can we make 26 or 4?
From [33, 24, 88, 93]:

Let's try to get 26.
If we can make 26, then maybe 2 * 26 = 52.

Let's try to make 26 from two numbers.

93 - 89 (need 89)

Let's try combining numbers to get something close to 52.
88 - 33 = 55. Close to 52. We have 24 and 93 left.
Can we adjust 55 by 3 using 24 and 93?
55 - 3 = 52.
Can we make 3 from 24 and 93?
93 / 24 (not integer)
24 / 93 (not integer)
93 - 24 = 69
24 - 93 = -69
93 + 24 = 117
24 + 93 = 117
So, (88 - 33) - (something from 24 and 93) = 52.
55 - X = 52 => X = 3.
We cannot make 3 from 24 and 93.

Let's try another combination.
What if we use division to reduce a large number?
88 / 24 (not integer)
93 / 33 (not integer)

Let's try to make a number that, when operated with another number, gives 52.
For example, if we have X * Y = 52.
Possible pairs (X, Y): (1, 52), (2, 26), (4, 13).

Can we make 26 from two numbers and 2 from the other two?

93 - ? = 4 => ? = 89 (need 89 from 33, 24, 88)

The user wants me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers 48, 56, 91, and 21, and the operations +, -, *, /.
The target value is 78.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [48, 56, 91, 21]
Target: 78

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations to reach 78.

Let's try some combinations.
The numbers are quite spread out. 91 is the largest, 21 is the smallest.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest number and try to adjust it.
2. Try to create smaller numbers that can be combined.
3. Look for divisions that result in integers.

Let's check for integer divisions:
48 / 21 - not integer
48 / 56 - not integer
48 / 91 - not integer
56 / 21 - not integer
56 / 48 - not integer
56 / 91 - not integer
91 / 21 - not integer
91 / 48 - not integer
91 / 56 - not integer
21 / 48 - not integer
21 / 56 - not integer
21 / 91 - not integer

It seems direct integer division between any two numbers is not possible. This means division might be used in a way that results in a non-integer intermediate, or it's part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer. Or, division might not be used at all.

Let's try combining numbers.
Target is 78.

Possibility 1: Multiplication involved.
If I multiply two numbers, the result will be large.
48 * 21 = 1008 (too big)
48 * 56 = 2688 (too big)
48 * 91 = 4368 (too big)
56 * 21 = 1176 (too big)
56 * 91 = 5096 (too big)
91 * 21 = 1911 (too big)

This suggests that if multiplication is used, it's likely multiplying a smaller number by a result of other operations, or it's part of a subtraction from a larger number.

Let's try to get close to 78.
91 - 21 = 70. Remaining numbers are 48, 56. Can I get 8 from 48 and 56?
56 - 48 = 8.
So, (91 - 21) + (56 - 48) = 70 + 8 = 78.
This uses all numbers: 91, 21, 56, 48.
It uses operations: -, +, -.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 91, 21, 56, 48 (all used once)
Operations used: -, +, - (allowed)
Result: (91 - 21) + (56 - 48) = 70 + 8 = 78.

Let's try another path to be sure.
What if I try to make a number around 78 using two numbers and then adjust with the other two?
Example: 91 - something = 78. Something = 13. Can I make 13 from 48, 56, 21?
56 - 48 = 8. 21 - 8 = 13. So, 91 - (21 - (56 - 48)) = 91 - (21 - 8) = 91 - 13 = 78.
This also works. Numbers: 91, 21, 56, 48. Operations: -, -, -.

Let's try another.
What if I try to make a number around 78 using three numbers and then adjust with the last one?
Example: 48 + 21 = 69. Remaining: 56, 91. Target: 78. Need 9. Can I get 9 from 56 and 91?
91 - 56 = 35. No.
56 - 91 = -35. No.

Example: 56 + 21 = 77. Remaining: 48, 91. Target: 78. Need 1. Can I get 1 from 48 and 91?
91 - 48 = 43. No.

Example: 91 - 48 = 43. Remaining: 56, 21. Target: 78. Need 35. Can I get 35 from 56 and 21?
56 - 21 = 35.
So, (91 - 48) + (56 - 21) = 43 + 35 = 78.
This also works. Numbers: 91, 48, 56, 21. Operations: -, +, -.

Example: 91 - 56 = 35. Remaining: 48, 21. Target: 78. Need 43. Can I get 43 from 48 and 21?
48 - 21 = 27. No.
48 + 21 = 69. No.

Let's consider division again.
What if division is the last operation?
Something / Something = 78. Unlikely with these numbers.

What if division is an intermediate step?
Let's try to create a number that, when multiplied by one of the remaining numbers, gets close to 78.
For example, if we have 26 * 3 = 78. Can we make 26 and 3 from the numbers?
Numbers: [48, 56, 91, 21]
Can we make 26?
56 - 21 - ? = 26? 35 - ? = 26. ? = 9. No 9.
48 - 21 = 27. Close.
91 / ? = 26? No.

Let's go back to the first solution found: (91 - 21) + (56 - 48) = 78.
This is simple and uses all numbers and allowed operations.

Let's check the second solution: 91 - (21 - (56 - 48)) = 78.
This is also valid.

Let's check the third solution: (91 - 48) + (56 - 21) = 78.
This is also valid.

The prompt asks for ""a mathematical equation"". Any of these would suffice. I will pick the first one as it seems the most straightforward.

(91 - 21) + (56 - 48)
Step 1: 91 - 21 = 70
Step 2: 56 - 48 = 8
Step 3: 70 + 8 = 78

All numbers [48, 56, 91, 21] are used exactly once.
Operations are +, -.
The target 78 is reached.

Let's consider another possibility involving multiplication.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 78.
Or A * (B + C - D) = 78.

Let's try to make a factor of 78. Factors of 78 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 26, 39, 78.
Can we make 39?
48 - ? = 39. ? = 9. No.
56 - ? = 39. ? = 17. No.
91 - 56 = 35. Close.
91 - 48 = 43. Close.
21 + ? = 39. ? = 18. No.

Can we make 26?
48 - 21 = 27. Close.
56 - ? = 26. ? = 30. No.
91 / ? = 26. No.

Can we make 13?
21 - ? = 13. ? = 8. We saw 56 - 48 = 8.
So, 21 - (56 - 48) = 21 - 8 = 13.
The remaining number is 91.
Can we use 91 and 13 to get 78?

The user wants me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers [62, 25, 31] and the operations +, -, *, / to equal 68.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 62, N2 = 25, N3 = 31.
The target result is 68.

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3
2. N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Let's try structure 1: (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3

Case 1.1: (62 + 25) + 31 = 87 + 31 = 118 (Too high)
Case 1.2: (62 + 25) - 31 = 87 - 31 = 56 (Too low)
Case 1.3: (62 + 25) * 31 = 87 * 31 (Very high)
Case 1.4: (62 + 25) / 31 = 87 / 31 (Not an integer, unlikely to reach 68)

Case 1.5: (62 - 25) + 31 = 37 + 31 = 68 (This looks promising!)
Let's check this: 62 - 25 = 37. Then 37 + 31 = 68.
Numbers used: 62, 25, 31. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +. These are fundamental arithmetic operations.
Result: 68. This matches the target.

Let's continue exploring just to be thorough and ensure no other simpler or more obvious solution was missed, and to confirm this is a valid approach.

Case 1.6: (62 - 25) - 31 = 37 - 31 = 6 (Too low)
Case 1.7: (62 - 25) * 31 = 37 * 31 (Very high)
Case 1.8: (62 - 25) / 31 = 37 / 31 (Not an integer)

Case 1.9: (62 * 25) + 31 = 1550 + 31 = 1581 (Very high)
Case 1.10: (62 * 25) - 31 = 1550 - 31 = 1519 (Very high)

Case 1.15: (62 / 25) * 31 (Not an integer)
Case 1.16: (62 / 25) / 31 (Not an integer)

Now let's try structure 2: N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Case 2.1: 62 + (25 + 31) = 62 + 56 = 118 (Too high)
Case 2.2: 62 + (25 - 31) = 62 + (-6) = 56 (Too low)
Case 2.3: 62 + (25 * 31) = 62 + 775 = 837 (Very high)
Case 2.4: 62 + (25 / 31) (Not an integer)

Case 2.5: 62 - (25 + 31) = 62 - 56 = 6 (Too low)
Case 2.6: 62 - (25 - 31) = 62 - (-6) = 68 (This also works!)
Let's check this: 25 - 31 = -6. Then 62 - (-6) = 62 + 6 = 68.
Numbers used: 62, 25, 31. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -. These are fundamental arithmetic operations.
Result: 68. This matches the target.

Case 2.7: 62 - (25 * 31) = 62 - 775 (Very low)
Case 2.8: 62 - (25 / 31) (Not an integer)

Case 2.9: 62 * (25 + 31) = 62 * 56 (Very high)

Case 2.15: 62 / (25 * 31) (Very low, not integer)
Case 2.16: 62 / (25 / 31) = 62 * (31/25) (Not integer)

I have found two potential solutions:
1. (62 - 25) + 31 = 68
2. 62 - (25 - 31) = 68

Both are valid according to the rules. The first one is slightly simpler in terms of operation precedence if parentheses are considered. The problem doesn't specify which one to choose if multiple exist, so I'll pick the first one found.

Let's re-verify the first solution: (62 - 25) + 31
Numbers: 62, 25, 31. All used once.
Operations: -, +. Both are fundamental.
Calculation: 62 - 25 = 37. 37 + 31 = 68. Correct.

Let's re-verify the second solution: 62 - (25 - 31)
Numbers: 62, 25, 31. All used once.
Operations: -, -. Both are fundamental.
Calculation: 25 - 31 = -6. 62 - (-6) = 62 + 6 = 68. Correct.

I will present the first one as it's more straightforward.
The expression is (62 - 25) + 31.
This uses 62, 25, and 31 exactly once.
It uses subtraction and addition, which are fundamental operations.
The result is 68.

Final check of constraints:
- Set of numbers: [62 25 31] - Used.
- Equation yields 68 - Yes.
- Only fundamental arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) - Yes.
- Every number from the set MUST be incorporated exactly once - Yes.

The solution (62 - 25) + 31 = 68 satisfies all conditions.
I will format the answer as requested.

The problem asks us to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers 74, 53, and 34 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to achieve a target value of 13.

Let the numbers be N1 = 74, N2 = 53, N3 = 34.

The number of ways to place 2 operators between 3 numbers is 4 * 4 = 16 (4 choices for the first operator, 4 for the second). However, we also need to consider the order of operations (parentheses).

    *   88 * 41 (way too high).
    *   88 / 41 (not a whole number).

2.  **Start with 41:**
    *   41 - 3 = 38. Need to use 88. 38 + 88 (too high). 38 - 88 (negative). 38 * 88 (way too high). 38 / 88 (fraction).
    *   41 + 3 = 44. Need to use 88. 44 + 88 (too high). 44 - 88 (negative). 44 * 88 (way too high). 44 / 88 (fraction).
    *   41 * 3 = 123. Need to use 88. 123 - 88 = 35. This works!

Let's verify: (41 * 3) - 88 = 123 - 88 = 35.
All numbers (41, 3, 88) are used exactly once.
Only basic operations (+, -, *, /) are used.
The target value (35) is reached.

The equation is (41 * 3) - 88 = 35.

I need to explore combinations of these three numbers with the allowed operators.

Let's list the numbers: 12, 44, 9.
Target: 33.

Possible structures:

2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combining two numbers first and then operating with the third.

Let's reconsider the structure (a op b) op c.
What if division is involved in a way that results in a smaller number?

Try division first:
*   44 / 12 = Not integer.
*   44 / 9 = Not integer.
*   12 / 44 = Not integer.
*   12 / 9 = Not integer.
*   9 / 44 = Not integer.
*   9 / 12 = Not integer.

This suggests that if division is used, it must be the last operation or part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's try expressions that might get us close to 33.
We have 44, which is larger than 33. We need to subtract from it or divide it.
We have 12 and 9.

Consider 44 - something = 33. That 'something' would be 11.
Can we make 11 from 12 and 9?
*   12 - 9 = 3 (No)
*   12 + 9 = 21 (No)
*   12 * 9 = 108 (No)
*   12 / 9 = Not integer.
*   9 / 12 = Not integer.

Consider something - 44 = 33. That 'something' would be 77.
Can we make 77 from 12 and 9?
*   12 * 9 = 108 (No)
*   12 + 9 = 21 (No)

Consider something * 44 = 33. Not possible with integers.
Consider something / 44 = 33. Not possible with integers.

Consider 44 / something = 33. Not possible with integers.

Let's try combining 12 and 9 first, then operating with 44.
We saw 12 - 9 = 3. Then 3 op 44.
44 - 3 = 41 (No)
3 + 44 = 47 (No)

What if we use multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract?
Let's try (12 * 44) op 9. Too large.
Let's try (12 * 9) op 44.
12 * 9 = 108.
108 - 44 = 64 (No)
44 - 108 = -64 (No)

Let's try (44 * 9) op 12.
44 * 9 = 396. Too large.

Let's try division in a different way.
Maybe something like (44 + 12) / 9?
44 + 12 = 56. 56 / 9 = Not integer.

Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (42) and try to reduce it.**
    *   42 - ? = 21. This means ? = 21. Can I make 21 from 41 and 39?
        *   41 - 39 = 2 (Not 21)

        *   41 / 39 = not integer (Not 21)
        *   39 - 41 = -2 (Not 21)
        *   39 / 41 = not integer (Not 21)
    *   So, 42 - (something from 41 and 39) doesn't seem to work directly.

    *   42 - 41 = 1. How to get 21 from 1 and 39?
        *   1 + 39 = 40 (Not 21)
        *   1 - 39 = -38 (Not 21)
        *   1 * 39 = 39 (Not 21)
        *   1 / 39 = not integer (Not 21)
    *   41 * 42 = large.
    *   41 / 42 = not integer.
    *   42 / 41 = not integer.

    *   41 + 39 = 80. How to get 21 from 80 and 42?
        *   80 - 42 = 38 (Not 21)
        *   80 + 42 = 122 (Not 21)
        *   80 * 42 = large (Not 21)
        *   80 / 42 = not integer (Not 21)
    *   41 - 39 = 2. How to get 21 from 2 and 42?
        *   2 + 42 = 44 (Not 21)
        *   2 - 42 = -40 (Not 21)
        *   2 * 42 = 84 (Not 21)
        *   2 / 42 = not integer (Not 21)
        *   42 / 2 = 21. This looks promising!
        *   So, if I can make 2 from 41 and 39, and then divide 42 by that result, I get 21.
        *   The operation to make 2 from 41 and 39 is 41 - 39.
        *   So the equation would be 42 / (41 - 39).
        *   Let's check: 42 / (41 - 39) = 42 / 2 = 21.
        *   This uses 41, 42, and 39 exactly once.
        *   It uses division and subtraction.
        *   The result is 21.

3.  **Let's double check other combinations just in case.**
    *   42 + 39 = 81. How to get 21 from 81 and 41?
        *   81 - 41 = 40 (Not 21)
        *   81 + 41 = 122 (Not 21)
        *   81 * 41 = large (Not 21)
        *   81 / 41 = not integer (Not 21)
    *   42 - 39 = 3. How to get 21 from 3 and 41?
        *   3 + 41 = 44 (Not 21)
        *   3 - 41 = -38 (Not 21)
        *   3 * 41 = 123 (Not 21)

        *   41 / 3 = not integer (Not 21)
    *   42 * 39 = large.
    *   42 / 39 = not integer.
    *   39 / 42 = not integer.

The combination 42 / (41 - 39) = 21 seems to be the correct and only solution.
The steps were:
1. Identify the target result (21) and the available numbers (41, 42, 39).
2. Consider operations that might lead to 21. Division is a good candidate if one number is a multiple of another or a combination of others.
3. Test combinations of two numbers to see if they can form a divisor or dividend that, when combined with the third number, yields 21.
4. Found that 41 - 39 = 2.
5. Checked if 42 divided by 2 equals 21. It does.
6. Constructed the equation: 42 / (41 - 39).
7. Verified that all numbers are used exactly once and the operations are allowed.

Let's try some combinations:

20. 27 - (44 - 54) = 27 - (-10) = 37 (Close, but not 42)
21. 27 - (44 * 54) (Negative)

Let's try division first to reduce numbers.
54 / 27 = 2.
Now we have 2 and 44.
2 + 44 = 46 (Close)
44 - 2 = 42.
So, 44 - (54 / 27) = 42.
This uses all numbers (44, 54, 27) and operations (- and /) exactly once.

Let's verify:
44 - (54 / 27)
= 44 - 2
= 42.
This works.

Another possibility:
(54 / 27) = 2
44 - 2 = 42.
This is the same equation.

What if we start with 44?
44 / 2 = 22. We don't have 2.
44 / 4 = 11. We don't have 4.

Let's try multiplication.
27 * 2 = 54. We have 54.
So, 27 * (54 / 27) = 27 * 2 = 54. Not 42.

Let's re-examine the numbers and target.
Numbers: 27, 54, 44
Target: 42

We found 44 - (54 / 27) = 42.

Are there other ways?
Maybe division at the end?
(X op Y) / Z = 42
(27 + 54) / 44 = 81 / 44 (No)
(54 - 27) / 44 = 27 / 44 (No)
(44 - 27) / 54 = 17 / 54 (No)
(44 + 27) / 54 = 71 / 54 (No)
(27 * 54) / 44 (No)
(54 * 44) / 27 (No)
(27 * 44) / 54 (No)

Let's try subtraction at the end.
X - (Y op Z) = 42
54 - (44 - 27) = 54 - 17 = 37 (No)
54 - (44 + 27) = 54 - 71 = -17 (No)
54 - (27 * 44) (No)
54 - (44 / 27) (No)
44 - (54 / 27) = 44 - 2 = 42. (Yes, found this one)
44 - (54 - 27) = 44 - 27 = 17 (No)
44 - (27 / 54) (No)
27 - (54 - 44) = 27 - 10 = 17 (No)
27 - (44 - 54) = 27 - (-10) = 37 (No)

Let's try addition at the end.
X + (Y op Z) = 42
27 + (54 - 44) = 27 + 10 = 37 (No)
27 + (44 - 54) = 27 + (-10) = 17 (No)
27 + (54 / 44) (No)
27 + (44 / 54) (No)
44 + (27 - 54) = 44 + (-27) = 17 (No)
44 + (54 - 27) = 44 + 27 = 71 (No)
44 + (27 / 54) (No)
44 + (54 / 27) = 44 + 2 = 46 (No)

Let's try multiplication at the end.
X * (Y op Z) = 42
This is unlikely as 42 has factors 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21.
If X is 27, 54, or 44, the other part would need to be a fraction.
e.g., 27 * (something) = 42 => something = 42/27 = 14/9. Can we make 14/9 from 54 and 44? No.
e.g., 54 * (something) = 42 => something = 42/54 = 7/9. Can we make 7/9 from 27 and 44? No.
e.g., 44 * (something) = 42 => something = 42/44 = 21/22. Can we make 21/22 from 27 and 54? No.

The equation 44 - (54 / 27) = 42 seems to be the only valid one.
The numbers are 27, 54, 44.
The operations are -, /.
The target is 42.
All numbers used once.
All operations used once.

Let's double check the constraints: ""every number must be utilized precisely once"". ""limited to +, -, *, / operations"".

The equation 44 - (54 / 27) = 42 uses the numbers 44, 54, and 27 exactly once.
It uses the operations - and /.
It reaches the target 42.

The question implies using *all* the operations if possible, but it says ""limited to"" which means I can use a subset. However, usually these puzzles imply using as many operations as possible or all of them if the number of operands allows.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 72, 67, and 42 exactly once, with only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to equal 97.

I need to explore combinations of these three numbers and the four operations. There are 3! = 6 permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the four basic ones. This gives 4^3 = 64 combinations of operations for each number permutation. However, the order of operations matters (PEMDAS/BODMAS), so I need to consider parentheses as well.

Let's list the numbers: 72, 67, 42. Target: 97.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try permutations of the numbers and see if any combinations yield 97.

Permutation 1: 72, 67, 42
   - (72 + 67) + 42 = 139 + 42 = 181 (Too high)
   - (72 + 67) - 42 = 139 - 42 = 97 (Found it!)

Let's verify this.
Numbers used: 72, 67, 42 (all used once).
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic).
Result: 97.

This seems to be a valid solution. I should double-check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but the prompt only asks for *an* equation.

Let's try another permutation to see the process.
Permutation 2: 72, 42, 67
   - (72 + 42) + 67 = 114 + 67 = 181
   - (72 + 42) - 67 = 114 - 67 = 47
   - (72 - 42) + 67 = 30 + 67 = 97 (Found another one!)

Let's verify this second solution.
Numbers used: 72, 42, 67 (all used once).
Operations used: -, + (basic arithmetic).
Result: 97.

Both (72 + 67) - 42 and (72 - 42) + 67 work. The prompt asks for *an* equation. I will present the first one I found.

Let's consider other operations for the first permutation (72, 67, 42):
   - (72 - 67) + 42 = 5 + 42 = 47
   - (72 * 67) + 42 = 4824 + 42 = 4866 (Too high)
   - (72 / 67) + 42 = (approx 1.07) + 42 = 43.07 (Not an integer, likely not intended)
   - (72 + 67) * 42 = 139 * 42 = 5838 (Too high)
   - (72 - 67) * 42 = 5 * 42 = 210 (Too high)
   - (72 * 67) - 42 = 4824 - 42 = 4782 (Too high)
   - (72 / 67) - 42 = (approx 1.07) - 42 = -40.93
   - 72 + (67 - 42) = 72 + 25 = 97 (Found a third one!)

Let's verify this third solution.
Numbers used: 72, 67, 42 (all used once).
Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic).
Result: 97.

This is also a valid solution. I will stick with the first one found for simplicity.
(72 + 67) - 42 = 139 - 42 = 97.

Let's consider the second solution found: (72 - 42) + 67 = 30 + 67 = 97.
This is also valid.

Let's consider the third solution found: 72 + (67 - 42) = 72 + 25 = 97.
This is also valid.

The prompt asks for *an* equation. I will present the first one I found: (72 + 67) - 42.
The steps were:
1. Identify the numbers: 72, 67, 42.
2. Identify the target: 97.
3. Identify allowed operations: +, -, *, /.
4. Consider permutations of numbers and combinations of operations.
5. Try (72 + 67) = 139.
6. Then try 139 - 42 = 97.
7. This uses all numbers once and only basic operations.
8. The equation is (72 + 67) - 42 = 97.

The user wants a mathematical equation that results in 25, using the numbers 21, 95, and 49 exactly once. The allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: [21, 95, 49]
Target value: 25

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. Since there are only three numbers, the structure of the equation will likely involve two operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try different combinations systematically.

**Attempt 1: Start with 95**
*   95 + 21 + 49 = 165 (Too high)
*   95 + 21 - 49 = 67 (Too high)
*   95 + 49 - 21 = 123 (Too high)
*   95 - 21 + 49 = 123 (Too high)
*   95 - 21 - 49 = 25 (This looks promising!)
    *   Let's check: 95 - 21 = 74. 74 - 49 = 25.
    *   Numbers used: 95, 21, 49 (all used exactly once).
    *   Operations used: -, - (allowed).
    *   Target value: 25 (achieved).
    *   This seems like a valid solution.

Let's continue exploring just to be thorough and ensure there aren't other possibilities or to confirm this is the most straightforward.

**Attempt 2: Start with 49**
*   49 + 95 + 21 = 165
*   49 + 95 - 21 = 123
*   49 + 21 - 95 = -25 (Close, but negative)
*   49 - 95 + 21 = -25 (Close, but negative)
*   49 - 95 - 21 = -67
*   49 * 21 = 1029 (Too high, division might be needed)
*   49 / 21 = 7/3 (Not an integer, might lead to fractions)
*   49 * 95 = 4655 (Too high)
*   49 / 95 (Fraction)

Let's consider division more carefully.
If we use division, it's likely to reduce the numbers significantly.

**Attempt 3: Using division**
*   Can we get 25 by dividing one number by another and then operating with the third?
    *   95 / 21 (Fraction)
    *   95 / 49 (Fraction)
    *   49 / 21 (Fraction)
    *   21 / 95 (Fraction)
    *   21 / 49 (Fraction)
    *   49 / 95 (Fraction)

This suggests that direct division of two numbers from the set might not yield an integer that helps easily reach 25. However, division could be the *last* operation.

Let's revisit the structure (a op1 b) op2 c.
We found 95 - 21 - 49 = 25. This fits the structure (a - b) - c.

What about a op1 (b op2 c)?
*   95 - (21 + 49) = 95 - 70 = 25.
    *   Numbers used: 95, 21, 49 (all used exactly once).
    *   Operations used: -, + (allowed).
    *   Target value: 25 (achieved).
    *   This is another valid solution.

*   95 - (49 - 21) = 95 - 28 = 67 (Not 25)
*   95 - (21 - 49) = 95 - (-28) = 95 + 28 = 123 (Not 25)

*   21 + (95 - 49) = 21 + 46 = 67 (Not 25)
*   21 - (95 - 49) = 21 - 46 = -25 (Close, but negative)
*   21 - (49 - 95) = 21 - (-46) = 21 + 46 = 67 (Not 25)

*   49 + (95 - 21) = 49 + 74 = 123 (Not 25)
*   49 - (95 - 21) = 49 - 74 = -25 (Close, but negative)
*   49 - (21 - 95) = 49 - (-74) = 49 + 74 = 123 (Not 25)

Let's consider multiplication.
*   21 * 49 = 1029 (Too big)
*   21 * 95 = 1995 (Too big)
*   49 * 95 = 4655 (Too big)

If multiplication is involved, division must also be involved to reduce the numbers.
Example: (95 * 21) / 49 ?
95 * 21 = 1995
1995 / 49 = 40.71... (Not integer)

Example: (95 * 49) / 21 ?
95 * 49 = 4655
4655 / 21 = 221.66... (Not integer)

Example: (21 * 49) / 95 ?
21 * 49 = 1029
1029 / 95 = 10.83... (Not integer)

What if division is used first?
*   (95 / ?) ...
*   (49 / ?) ...
*   (21 / ?) ...

Let's try to get a number that, when operated with the third, gives 25.
Suppose we have X op Y = 25.
Possible X, Y pairs:
*   X + Y = 25
*   X - Y = 25
*   Y - X = 25
*   X * Y = 25 (Not possible with these numbers)
*   X / Y = 25 (Not possible with these numbers)

Let's try to form one of the numbers using two of the given numbers.
Can we make 21 using 95 and 49?
*   95 - 49 = 46 (No)
*   49 - 95 = -46 (No)
*   95 + 49 = 144 (No)
*   95 / 49 (No)
*   49 / 95 (No)

Can we make 95 using 21 and 49?
*   21 + 49 = 70 (No)
*   49 - 21 = 28 (No)
*   21 - 49 = -28 (No)
*   21 * 49 = 1029 (No)
*   21 / 49 (No)
*   49 / 21 (No)

Can we make 49 using 21 and 95?
*   95 - 21 = 74 (No)
*   21 - 95 = -74 (No)
*   95 + 21 = 116 (No)
*   95 / 21 (No)
*   21 / 95 (No)

This confirms that we likely won't be forming one of the original numbers from the other two.

Let's go back to the successful ones:
1.  95 - 21 - 49 = 25
2.  95 - (21 + 49) = 25

Both are valid. The prompt asks for *a* mathematical equation. I will choose the first one as it's slightly simpler in terms of parenthesis.

Let's double check the conditions for 95 - 21 - 49 = 25:
*   Uses numbers [21, 95, 49] exactly once: Yes (95, 21, 49).
*   Allowed operations (+, -, *, /): Yes (two subtractions).
*   Achieves target value of 25: Yes (95 - 2",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 88, 40, and 12 that evaluates to 60.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's try combinations:

1.  (88 - 40) + 12 = 48 + 12 = 60. This works!
    Numbers used: 88, 40, 12 (all used once).
    Operations used: -, + (standard arithmetic).
    Result: 60 (target value).

Let's double-check other possibilities to ensure this is a valid and perhaps the most straightforward one.

2.  88 - (40 - 12) = 88 - 28 = 60. This also works!
    Numbers used: 88, 40, 12 (all used once).

3.  88 + 40 - 12 = 128 - 12 = 116 (Incorrect)
4.  88 - 12 + 40 = 76 + 40 = 116 (Incorrect)
5.  40 + 12 - 88 = 52 - 88 = -36 (Incorrect)
6.  40 - 12 + 88 = 28 + 88 = 116 (Incorrect)
7.  12 + 40 - 88 = 52 - 88 = -36 (Incorrect)
8.  12 - 40 + 88 = -28 + 88 = 60. This also works!
    Numbers used: 12, 40, 88 (all used once).
    Operations used: -, + (standard arithmetic).
    Result: 60 (target value).

9.  88 / 40 * 12 = 2.2 * 12 = 26.4 (Incorrect)
10. 88 * 40 / 12 = 3520 / 12 = 293.33... (Incorrect)
11. 40 / 12 * 88 = 3.33... * 88 = 293.33... (Incorrect)
12. 40 * 12 / 88 = 480 / 88 = 5.45... (Incorrect)
13. 12 / 40 * 88 = 0.3 * 88 = 26.4 (Incorrect)
14. 12 * 40 / 88 = 480 / 88 = 5.45... (Incorrect)

Let's consider division that results in integers.
88 / 12 is not an integer.
88 / 40 is not an integer.
40 / 12 is not an integer.
40 / 88 is not an integer.
12 / 40 is not an integer.
12 / 88 is not an integer.

So, division is unlikely to be the primary operation unless it's part of a larger expression that cancels out or leads to an integer.

Let's re-examine the successful ones:
(88 - 40) + 12 = 60
88 - (40 - 12) = 60
12 - 40 + 88 = 60

All three are valid. I will pick the first one as it's straightforward.

The user wants me to create a single arithmetic expression using the numbers 50, 33, and 48 exactly once.
The allowed operations are +, -, *, /.
The target result is 65.

Let's list the numbers: [50, 33, 48]
Target: 65

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations to get 65.
There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers.
For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each position can be one of the 4 operations. This gives 4^3 = 64 combinations of operations for each permutation.
However, the order of operations matters (parentheses).

Let's try some combinations.

Strategy 1: Start with the largest number (50) and see how to adjust it.
Target is 65, which is 15 more than 50.
Can I get 15 from 33 and 48?
Possible combinations of 33 and 48:
33 + 48 = 81 (Too large)
48 - 33 = 15 (This looks promising!)
33 - 48 = -15
33 * 48 = 1584 (Too large)
48 / 33 (Not an integer, likely not useful unless it cancels out later)
33 / 48 (Not an integer)

If I can get 15 from 48 - 33, then I can add this to 50.
Expression: 50 + (48 - 33)
Let's check:
50 + (48 - 33) = 50 + 15 = 65.
This uses 50, 48, and 33 exactly once.
It uses only addition and subtraction.
The result is 65.
This seems like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

Strategy 2: Try multiplying two numbers first.
50 * 33 = 1650 (Too large)
50 * 48 = 2400 (Too large)
33 * 48 = 1584 (Too large)

Strategy 3: Try dividing first.
50 / 33 (Not integer)
50 / 48 (Not integer)
33 / 48 (Not integer)
48 / 33 (Not integer)
33 / 50 (Not integer)
48 / 50 (Not integer)

This suggests that division might not be the first operation unless it leads to a useful integer or a fraction that cancels out.

Let's reconsider the numbers and target: [50, 33, 48], Target: 65.

What if 50 is not the first number?
Try starting with 33.
Target is 65.
Can I get 65 from 33 and (50, 48)?
Possible combinations of 50 and 48:
50 + 48 = 98
50 - 48 = 2
48 - 50 = -2
50 * 48 = 2400
50 / 48
48 / 50

If I have 33, I need to get 65 - 33 = 32 from 50 and 48.
Can I get 32 from 50 and 48?
50 - 48 = 2 (No)
48 - 50 = -2 (No)
50 + 48 = 98 (No)
50 * 48 = 2400 (No)
50 / 48 (No)
48 / 50 (No)

What if I have 33, and I need to get 65 by combining it with something derived from 50 and 48?
Let's try 33 + (something from 50, 48). We need 32. No luck.
Let's try 33 - (something from 50, 48). We need 33 - X = 65, so X = 33 - 65 = -32. Can I get -32 from 50, 48? 48 - 50 = -2. No.
Let's try (something from 50, 48) - 33. We need X - 33 = 65, so X = 98. Can I get 98 from 50, 48? 50 + 48 = 98. Yes!
Expression: (50 + 48) - 33
Let's check:
(50 + 48) - 33 = 98 - 33 = 65.
This also uses 50, 48, and 33 exactly once.
It uses only addition and subtraction.
The result is 65.
This is another valid solution.

Try starting with 48.
Target is 65.
Can I get 65 from 48 and (50, 33)?
We need 65 - 48 = 17 from 50 and 33.
50 - 33 = 17. Yes!
Expression: 48 + (50 - 33)
Let's check:
48 + (50 - 33) = 48 + 17 = 65.
This uses 48, 50, and 33 exactly once.
It uses only addition and subtraction.
The result is 65.
This is another valid solution.

We have found three valid solutions:
1. 50 + (48 - 33)
2. (50 + 48) - 33
3. 48 + (50 - 33)

The prompt asks for ""a single, valid arithmetic expression"". Any of these will do.
The first one I found, 50 + (48 - 33), is simple and direct.

Let's double check the requirements:
- Single, valid arithmetic expression: Yes.
- Incorporate all numerical values [50 33 48]: Yes.
- Each number used once and only once: Yes.
- Allowed operations: +, -, *, /: Yes, only + and - are used.
- Ultimate evaluation must yield the exact target value of 65: Yes.

Numbers used: 50 (once), 48 (once), 33 (once). All numbers from the list are used.
Operations used: + (once), - (once). These are allowed operations.

1.  Try to get close to 33 with two numbers first.

Let's list the numbers: {11, 59, 46}
Target result: 94

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations. Since there are only three numbers, the structure of the equation will likely be (a op b) op c or a op (b op c).

Let's try different pairings and operations.

Possibility 1: Start with multiplication or division, as these tend to change the magnitude of numbers significantly.

Try 59 * 11:
59 * 11 = 649. This is much larger than 94.
Now I need to use 46 to get to 94.
649 + 46 = 695 (too large)
649 - 46 = 603 (too large)
46 - 649 = -603 (too small)
649 / 46 is not an integer.

Try 59 * 46:
59 * 46 = 2714. Way too large.

Try 11 * 46:
11 * 46 = 506. Still too large.
506 + 59 = 565
506 - 59 = 447
59 - 506 = -447

Try division first.
59 / 11 is not an integer.
59 / 46 is not an integer.
46 / 11 is not an integer.
46 / 59 is not an integer.
11 / 59 is not an integer.
11 / 46 is not an integer.

This suggests that direct multiplication or division of two numbers might not be the first step if the result is very large or not an integer.

Let's consider addition and subtraction first.

Possibility 2: Start with addition or subtraction.

Try 59 + 46:
59 + 46 = 105.
Now I need to use 11 to get to 94.
105 + 11 = 116 (too large)

The numbers used are 59, 46, and 11. The operations are + and -.
The equation is (59 + 46) - 11 = 94.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: Yes (59, 46, 11).
Let's check if the result is 94: Yes.
Let's check if only allowed operations are used: Yes (+, -).

This looks like a valid solution. Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, but this one seems straightforward.

Let's try 59 - 46:
59 - 46 = 13.
Now use 11 to get to 94.
13 + 11 = 24 (too small)
13 * 11 = 143 (too large)
11 - 13 = -2 (too small)
13 / 11 is not an integer.
11 / 13 is not an integer.

Let's try 46 - 59:
46 - 59 = -13.
Now use 11 to get to 94.
-13 + 11 = -2 (too small)
-13 * 11 = -143 (too small)
11 - (-13) = 11 + 13 = 24 (too small)

Let's try 59 + 11:
59 + 11 = 70.
Now use 46 to get to 94.
70 + 46 = 116 (too large)
70 - 46 = 24 (too small)
46 - 70 = -24 (too small)
70 * 46 is too large.
70 / 46 is not an integer.
46 / 70 is not an integer.

Let's try 59 - 11:
59 - 11 = 48.
Now use 46 to get to 94.
48 + 46 = 94. This also works!
The numbers used are 59, 11, and 46. The operations are - and +.
The equation is (59 - 11) + 46 = 94.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: Yes (59, 11, 46).
Let's check if the result is 94: Yes.
Let's check if only allowed operations are used: Yes (-, +).

This is another valid solution. The problem asks for *an* equation, so either is fine. I'll present the first one I found.

Let's try 11 + 46:
11 + 46 = 57.
Now use 59 to get to 94.
57 + 59 = 116 (too large)
57 - 59 = -2 (too small)
59 - 57 = 2 (too small)
57 * 59 is too large.

Let's try 46 - 11:
46 - 11 = 35.
Now use 59 to get to 94.
35 + 59 = 94. This also works!
The numbers used are 46, 11, and 59. The operations are - and +.
The equation is (46 - 11) + 59 = 94.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: Yes (46, 11, 59).
Let's check if the result is 94: Yes.
Let's check if only allowed operations are used: Yes (-, +).

This is a third valid solution.

Let's try 11 - 46:
11 - 46 = -35.
Now use 59 to get to 94.
-35 + 59 = 24 (too small)
59 - (-35) = 59 + 35 = 94. This also works!
The numbers used are 11, 46, and 59. The operations are - and -.
The equation is 59 - (11 - 46) = 94.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: Yes (59, 11, 46).
Let's check if the result is 94: Yes.
Let's check if only allowed operations are used: Yes (-, -).

This is a fourth valid solution.

The problem asks for *an* equation. I will choose the first one I found: (59 + 46) - 11 = 94.
It's simple and uses addition and subtraction.

Let's double check the requirements:
- Utilize all numbers [11 59 46] exactly once: Yes.
- Result must precisely match 94: Yes.
- Allowed operations: +, -, *, /: Yes, I used + and -.
- No additional commentary outside tags: Yes.

The equation (59 + 46) - 11 = 94 satisfies all conditions.
59 + 46 = 105
105 - 11 = 94.

Another option was (59 - 11) + 46 = 94.
59 - 11 = 48
48 + 46 = 94.

Another option was (46 - 11) + 59 = 94.
46 - 11 = 35
35 + 59 = 94.

Another option was 59 - (11 - 46) = 94.
11 - 46 = -35
59 - (-35) = 59 + 35 = 94.

I will present the first one found.

2986,1159,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 11, 64, 45, and 53 exactly once, with the result being 46. I can only use +, -, *, and /.

Let's list the numbers: 11, 64, 45, 53.
Target result: 46.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. I'll try different groupings and orders.

Initial thoughts:
- The numbers 64 and 45 are relatively large. 53 is also close to the target. 11 is smaller.
- I need to get to 46.
- Maybe I can get close to 46 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.

Let's try combining 64 and 45 first.
64 + 45 = 109 (Too large)
64 - 45 = 19 (Could work, need to get 46 from 19 using 11 and 53)
45 - 64 = -19 (Unlikely to reach 46)
64 * 45 = 2880 (Way too large)
64 / 45 (Not an integer, unlikely to be useful unless it cancels out later)
45 / 64 (Not an integer)

Let's focus on 64 - 45 = 19.
Now I have 19, 11, 53. Target is 46.
Can I get 46 from 19, 11, 53?
19 + 11 = 30. Need 16 from 53. 53 - 16 = 37. No.
19 - 11 = 8. Need 38 from 53. 53 - 38 = 15. No.
19 * 11 = 209. Too large.
19 / 11 (Not integer)

19 + 53 = 72. Need 46 from 72 using 11. 72 - 11 = 61. No.
19 - 53 = -34. Need 46 from -34 using 11. -34 + 11 = -23. No.
19 * 53 = 1007. Too large.

Let's try combining 53 and 45.
53 + 45 = 98 (Too large)
53 - 45 = 8 (Could work, need to get 46 from 8 using 11 and 64)
45 - 53 = -8
53 * 45 = 2385
53 / 45
45 / 53

Focus on 53 - 45 = 8.
Now I have 8, 11, 64. Target is 46.
8 + 11 = 19. Need 27 from 64. 64 - 27 = 37. No.
8 - 11 = -3. Need 49 from 64. 64 - 49 = 15. No.
8 * 11 = 88. Need 46 from 88 using 64. 88 - 64 = 24. No.
8 / 11 (Not integer)

8 + 64 = 72. Need 46 from 72 using 11. 72 - 11 = 61. No.
8 - 64 = -56. Need 46 from -56 using 11. -56 + 11 = -45. No.
8 * 64 = 512. Too large.

Let's try combining 64 and 11.
64 + 11 = 75
64 - 11 = 53 (This is interesting, I have 53, 45, 53. But I can only use 53 once. So this path is invalid if I use the original 53.)
11 - 64 = -53
64 * 11 = 704
64 / 11 (Not integer)

Let's try combining 53 and 11.
53 + 11 = 64 (Again, 64 is one of the numbers. Invalid if I use the original 64.)
53 - 11 = 42 (Could work. Need to get 46 from 42 using 64 and 45.)
11 - 53 = -42
53 * 11 = 583

Focus on 53 - 11 = 42.
Now I have 42, 64, 45. Target is 46.
42 + 64 = 106. Need 46 from 106 using 45. 106 - 45 = 61. No.
42 - 64 = -22. Need 46 from -22 using 45. -22 + 45 = 23. No.
42 * 64 = 2688. Too large.

42 + 45 = 87. Need 46 from 87 using 64. 87 - 64 = 23. No.
42 - 45 = -3. Need 46 from -3 using 64. -3 + 64 = 61. No.

Let's try division.
Maybe a large number divided by a smaller one, then add/subtract.
64 / ?
64 / 11 (not integer)
64 / 45 (not integer)
64 / 53 (not integer)

45 / ?
45 / 11 (not integer)
45 / 64 (not integer)
45 / 53 (not integer)

53 / ?
53 / 11 (not integer)
53 / 64 (not integer)
53 / 45 (not integer)

11 / ?
11 / 64 (not integer)
11 / 45 (not integer)
11 / 53 (not integer)

This suggests that direct division of two numbers might not be the primary step unless it's part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's try combining three numbers first.
(64 + 45) - 11 = 109 - 11 = 98. Need 46 from 98 using 53. 98 - 53 = 45. No.
(64 - 45) + 11 = 19 + 11 = 30. Need 46 from 30 using 53. 30 + 53 = 83. No.
(64 - 45) - 11 = 19 - 11 = 8. Need 46 from 8 using 53. 8 + 53 = 61. No.
(64 + 11) - 45 = 75 - 45 = 30. Need 46 from 30 using 53. 30 + 53 = 83. No.
(64 - 11) + 45 = 53 + 45 = 98. Need 46 from 98 using 53. 98 - 53 = 45. No.
(64 - 11) - 45 = 53 - 45 = 8. Need 46 from 8 using 53. 8 + 53 = 61. No.

Let's try multiplication with one of the smaller numbers.
11 * ?
11 * 45 = 495 (Too large)
11 * 53 = 583 (Too large)
11 * 64 = 704 (Too large)

What if we use division to reduce a large number?
Maybe (64 * something) / something else?
Or (45 * something) / something else?

Let's consider the target 46.
It's an even number.
Numbers are 11, 64, 45, 53.

Try to get close to 46 with two numbers, then use the other two.
64 - 11 = 53. Remaining: 45, 53. Target: 46.

658,811,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 70, 48, and 55 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach a target value of 77.

Let's list the numbers: {70, 48, 55}.
Target: 77.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

We need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. Since there are three numbers, we will have two operations. The order of operations matters, so we should consider parentheses.

Let's try different combinations and see if we can get close to 77.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's assign the numbers to a, b, and c in different permutations.

1.  **Start with the largest number (95):**
    *   95 - ? = 81. This means ? = 14. Can we make 14 from 34, 24, and 4?

The problem requires me to create a mathematical equation that evaluates to 32.
The equation must use the numbers 55, 77, and 10 exactly once.
The allowed operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations to get 32.
Let's list the numbers: 55, 77, 10.
Target value: 32.

I can try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combining two numbers first and then operating with the third.

Possibility 1: Start with 55 and 77.
- 55 + 77 = 132. Then use 10. 132 + 10 = 142 (too high). 132 - 10 = 122 (too high). 132 * 10 = 1320 (too high). 132 / 10 = 13.2 (not 32).
- 55 - 77 = -22. Then use 10. -22 + 10 = -12 (not 32). -22 - 10 = -32 (close, but negative). -22 * 10 = -220 (too low). -22 / 10 = -2.2 (not 32).
- 77 - 55 = 22. Then use 10. 22 + 10 = 32. This looks promising!
Let's check the equation: (77 - 55) + 10.
(77 - 55) = 22.
22 + 10 = 32.
This equation uses 77, 55, and 10 exactly once, and only uses subtraction and addition. It evaluates to 32.

Let's verify if there are other possibilities just to be thorough.

Possibility 2: Start with 55 and 10.
- 55 + 10 = 65. Then use 77. 65 + 77 = 142. 65 - 77 = -12. 65 * 77 = 5005. 65 / 77 (fraction).
- 55 - 10 = 45. Then use 77. 45 + 77 = 122. 45 - 77 = -32 (close, but negative). 45 * 77 (large). 45 / 77 (fraction).
- 10 - 55 = -45. Then use 77. -45 + 77 = 32. This is another possibility!
Let's check the equation: (10 - 55) + 77.
(10 - 55) = -45.
-45 + 77 = 32.
This equation also uses 10, 55, and 77 exactly once, and only uses subtraction and addition. It evaluates to 32.

- 55 * 10 = 550. Then use 77. 550 + 77 (large). 550 - 77 (large). 550 * 77 (very large). 550 / 77 (fraction).
- 55 / 10 = 5.5. Then use 77. 5.5 + 77 = 82.5. 5.5 - 77 = -71.5. 5.5 * 77 = 423.5. 5.5 / 77 (fraction).
- 10 / 55 = 2/11. Then use 77. (2/11) + 77 = 77 + 2/11. (2/11) - 77. (2/11) * 77 = 2 * 7 = 14. (2/11) / 77.

Possibility 3: Start with 77 and 10.
- 77 + 10 = 87. Then use 55. 87 + 55 = 142. 87 - 55 = 32. This is another possibility!
Let's check the equation: (77 + 10) - 55.
(77 + 10) = 87.
87 - 55 = 32.
This equation also uses 77, 10, and 55 exactly once, and only uses addition and subtraction. It evaluates to 32.

- 77 - 10 = 67. Then use 55. 67 + 55 = 122. 67 - 55 = 12. 67 * 55 (large). 67 / 55 (fraction).
- 10 - 77 = -67. Then use 55. -67 + 55 = -12. -67 - 55 = -122. -67 * 55 (large). -67 / 55 (fraction).
- 77 * 10 = 770. Then use 55. 770 + 55 (large). 770 - 55 (large). 770 * 55 (very large). 770 / 55 = 14.
- 77 / 10 = 7.7. Then use 55. 7.7 + 55 = 62.7. 7.7 - 55 = -47.3. 7.7 * 55 = 423.5. 7.7 / 55 (fraction).
- 10 / 77. Then use 55.

I have found three valid equations:
1. (77 - 55) + 10 = 32
2. (10 - 55) + 77 = 32
3. (77 + 10) - 55 = 32

The problem asks for ""an equation"". Any one of these is sufficient. I will choose the first one as it seems the most straightforward.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Evaluates to 32: Yes.
- Constructed exclusively from [55 77 10]: Yes.
- Every single number within [55 77 10] must be incorporated: Yes.
- Used exactly one time: Yes.
- Only permissible mathematical operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/): Yes.

The equation (77 - 55) + 10 = 32 satisfies all conditions.
I will present this equation.

2.  (62 - 58) + 92 = 4 + 92 = 96 (Too high)

19. 92 / (62 - 58) = 92 / 4 = 23 (This works!)

Let's verify: 92 / (62 - 58) = 92 / 4 = 23.
All numbers (62, 58, 92) are used exactly once.

This equation satisfies all the conditions.

The problem asks for a single equation using the numbers 41, 12, and 16 exactly once, with standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 69.

Let the numbers be $n_1 = 41$, $n_2 = 12$, and $n_3 = 16$.
We need to arrange these numbers and operations to get 69.

The possible permutations of the numbers are:
1. (41, 12, 16)
2. (41, 16, 12)
3. (12, 41, 16)
4. (12, 16, 41)
5. (16, 41, 12)
6. (16, 12, 41)

For each permutation, we can try different combinations of two operations. Since there are three numbers, we will have two operations. The order of operations matters, so we need to consider parentheses as well.

Let's list the possible structures of the equation:
a) $(n_1 \text{ op1 } n_2) \text{ op2 } n_3$
b) $n_1 \text{ op1 } (n_2 \text{ op2 } n_3)$

The operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's start with permutation 1: (41, 12, 16).

Case 1.1: $(41 \text{ op1 } 12) \text{ op2 } 16 = 69$

Try operations:
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $(41 + 12) + 16 = 53 + 16 = 69$. This works!

Let's verify this.
Numbers used: 41, 12, 16 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: +, + (standard arithmetic operations).
Result: 69.

This seems to be a valid solution. However, the prompt asks for a rigorous chain of thought and to explore other possibilities. I should continue exploring to ensure this is the only or best solution, or to understand the space of possibilities.

Let's continue exploring other combinations for completeness, even though I've found a solution.

Permutation 1: (41, 12, 16)
Case 1.1: $(41 \text{ op1 } 12) \text{ op2 } 16 = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $(41 + 12) + 16 = 53 + 16 = 69$. (Found)
- op1 = +, op2 = -: $(41 + 12) - 16 = 53 - 16 = 37 \neq 69$.
- op1 = +, op2 = *: $(41 + 12) * 16 = 53 * 16 = 848 \neq 69$.
- op1 = +, op2 = /: $(41 + 12) / 16 = 53 / 16$ (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 69 easily).

- op1 = -, op2 = +: $(41 - 12) + 16 = 29 + 16 = 45 \neq 69$.
- op1 = -, op2 = -: $(41 - 12) - 16 = 29 - 16 = 13 \neq 69$.
- op1 = -, op2 = *: $(41 - 12) * 16 = 29 * 16 = 464 \neq 69$.
- op1 = -, op2 = /: $(41 - 12) / 16 = 29 / 16$.

- op1 = *, op2 = +: $(41 * 12) + 16 = 492 + 16 = 508 \neq 69$.
- op1 = *, op2 = -: $(41 * 12) - 16 = 492 - 16 = 476 \neq 69$.
- op1 = *, op2 = *: $(41 * 12) * 16 = 492 * 16$.
- op1 = *, op2 = /: $(41 * 12) / 16 = 492 / 16 = 123 / 4$.

- op1 = /, op2 = +: $(41 / 12) + 16$.
- op1 = /, op2 = -: $(41 / 12) - 16$.
- op1 = /, op2 = *: $(41 / 12) * 16$.
- op1 = /, op2 = /: $(41 / 12) / 16$.

Case 1.2: $41 \text{ op1 } (12 \text{ op2 } 16) = 69$

- op1 = +, op2 = +: $41 + (12 + 16) = 41 + 28 = 69$. This also works!
Numbers used: 41, 12, 16 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: +, + (standard arithmetic operations).
Result: 69.

So we have found two solutions:
1. $(41 + 12) + 16 = 69$
2. $41 + (12 + 16) = 69$

These are essentially the same due to the associative property of addition. The problem asks for ""a single equation"". I will present one of them.

Let's continue exploring other permutations just to be thorough and to demonstrate the process.

Permutation 2: (41, 16, 12)
Case 2.1: $(41 \text{ op1 } 16) \text{ op2 } 12 = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $(41 + 16) + 12 = 57 + 12 = 69$. This is another valid solution.
Numbers used: 41, 16, 12. Operations: +, +. Result: 69.

Case 2.2: $41 \text{ op1 } (16 \text{ op2 } 12) = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $41 + (16 + 12) = 41 + 28 = 69$. (Same as above due to commutativity and associativity of addition).

Permutation 3: (12, 41, 16)
Case 3.1: $(12 \text{ op1 } 41) \text{ op2 } 16 = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $(12 + 41) + 16 = 53 + 16 = 69$. (Same as first solution).

Case 3.2: $12 \text{ op1 } (41 \text{ op2 } 16) = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $12 + (41 + 16) = 12 + 57 = 69$. (Same as second solution).

Permutation 4: (12, 16, 41)
Case 4.1: $(12 \text{ op1 } 16) \text{ op2 } 41 = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $(12 + 16) + 41 = 28 + 41 = 69$. (Same as second solution).

Case 4.2: $12 \text{ op1 } (16 \text{ op2 } 41) = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $12 + (16 + 41) = 12 + 57 = 69$. (Same as second solution).

Permutation 5: (16, 41, 12)
Case 5.1: $(16 \text{ op1 } 41) \text{ op2 } 12 = 69$
- op1 = +, op2 = +: $(16 + 41) + 12 = 57 + 12 = 69$. (Same as third solution).

Let's try some combinations.

1.  **Start with the largest numbers:**
    *   89 and 54.
    *   89 - 54 = 35. This is close to 34.
    *   We have 23 and 3 left.
    *   Can we get -1 from 23 and 3?
    *   23 / 3 is not an integer.
    *   23 - 3 = 20.
    *   3 - 23 = -20.
    *   23 * 3 = 69.
    *   3 * 23 = 69.
    *   So, (89 - 54) + (something with 23 and 3) = 34.
    *   35 + (something with 23 and 3) = 34.
    *   This means (something with 23 and 3) must equal -1.
    *   We can't get -1 from 23 and 3 using basic operations.

2.  **Try another combination with large numbers:**
    *   89 and 23.
    *   89 - 23 = 66.
    *   We have 54 and 3 left.
    *   Can we get 34 - 66 = -32 from 54 and 3?
    *   54 / 3 = 18.
    *   54 - 3 = 51.
    *   3 - 54 = -51.
    *   54 * 3 = 162.
    *   No, -32 is not achievable.

3.  **Try multiplication:**
    *   Maybe 3 * something?
    *   3 * 89 = 267 (too big)
    *   3 * 54 = 162 (too big)
    *   3 * 23 = 69.
    *   We have 89 and 54 left.
    *   Can we get 34 - 69 = -35 from 89 and 54?
    *   89 - 54 = 35.
    *   54 - 89 = -35.
    *   So, (3 * 23) + (54 - 89) = 69 + (-35) = 34.
    *   This looks promising! Let's check the numbers used: 3, 23, 54, 89. All used exactly once. Operations are *, +, -.

4.  **Let's verify the equation:**
    *   (3 * 23) + (54 - 89)
    *   69 + (-35)
    *   34.
    *   This works.

5.  **Consider other possibilities just to be thorough:**
    *   What if we divide first?
    *   54 / 3 = 18.
    *   We have 23 and 89 left.
    *   Can we get 34 - 18 = 16 from 23 and 89?
    *   89 - 23 = 66.
    *   23 - 89 = -66.
    *   No.

    *   89 / ? (not integer with others)
    *   23 / ? (not integer with others)

    *   Let's try subtraction first with 54 and 23.
    *   54 - 23 = 31.
    *   We have 3 and 89 left.
    *   Can we get 34 - 31 = 3 from 3 and 89?
    *   89 / 3 (not integer)
    *   89 - 3 = 86
    *   3 - 89 = -86
    *   89 * 3 = 267
    *   No.

    *   Let's try 89 - 3 = 86.
    *   We have 23 and 54 left.
    *   Can we get 34 - 86 = -52 from 23 and 54?
    *   54 - 23 = 31.
    *   23 - 54 = -31.
    *   No.

The equation (3 * 23) + (54 - 89) = 34 seems to be the most straightforward and correct solution.
Let's write it clearly.
(3 * 23) + (54 - 89) = 69 + (-35) = 34.
Numbers used: 3, 23, 54, 89. All used once.
Operations used: *, +, -. Basic operations.
Result: 34.

The order of operations is important. Multiplication first, then addition/subtraction.
3 * 23 = 69
54 - 89 = -35
69 + (-35) = 34.

Alternatively, we could write it as 3 * 23 - (89 - 54).
3 * 23 = 69
89 - 54 = 35
69 - 35 = 34.
This also works and uses the same numbers and operations.
Let's stick with the first one found as it's a direct sum.

(3 * 23) + (54 - 89) = 34.
Check:
Numbers: 3, 23, 54, 89 (all used once).
Operations: *, +, - (basic operations).
Result: 34.

This is a valid solution.

273,315,"<think>The problem asks me to construct an equation using the numbers 97, 85, 72, and 90, each exactly once, with only the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to arrive at the result 20. I need to show all intermediate steps.

The target number is 20. The given numbers are 97, 85, 72, and 90.

Let's try to combine the numbers in different ways.

First, I'll consider the order of operations. Parentheses can be used to change the order.

Let's try to get numbers close to 20 by combining two numbers first.
97 + 85 = 182
97 - 85 = 12
97 * 85 = 8245
97 / 85 = 1.14...

85 - 72 = 13
72 - 85 = -13
85 + 72 = 157
85 * 72 = 6120
85 / 72 = 1.18...

90 - 72 = 18
72 - 90 = -18
90 + 72 = 162
90 * 72 = 6480
90 / 72 = 1.25

97 - 90 = 7
90 - 97 = -7
97 + 90 = 187
97 * 90 = 8730
97 / 90 = 1.07...

Let's try to combine three numbers.

Maybe I can get a number close to 20 by dividing two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others.
90 / 72 = 1.25. This doesn't seem very helpful.

Let's try to make a large number and then subtract from it.
97 + 85 + 72 + 90 = 344. Too large.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by another, gives something useful.
For example, if I can make 180, then 180 / 9 = 20. But I don't have 9.

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by something, gives something useful.
For example, if I can make 10, then 10 * 2 = 20.

Let's try to get 20 by adding/subtracting combinations.
Maybe I can get a number slightly larger than 20 and subtract a small number.
Or a number slightly smaller than 20 and add a small number.

Let's look at the numbers again: 97, 85, 72, 90.
The differences between pairs are:
97-85 = 12
97-72 = 25
97-90 = 7
85-72 = 13
85-90 = -5
72-90 = -18

Let's try to combine two numbers to get a number that, when operated with the other two, results in 20.

Consider (90 - 72) = 18.
Now I have 18, 97, 85. I need to get 20.
18 + ? = 20. I need 2. Can I get 2 from 97 and 85?
97 - 85 = 12. No.
85 - 97 = -12. No.
97 / 85. No.
85 / 97. No.
97 * 85. No.

Consider (97 - 85) = 12.
Now I have 12, 72, 90. I need to get 20.
12 + ? = 20. I need 8. Can I get 8 from 72 and 90?
90 - 72 = 18. No.
72 - 90 = -18. No.
90 / 72. No.
72 / 90. No.

Consider (97 - 72) = 25.
Now I have 25, 85, 90. I need to get 20.
25 - ? = 20. I need 5. Can I get 5 from 85 and 90?
90 - 85 = 5. Yes!
So, the equation could be (97 - 72) - (90 - 85) = 25 - 5 = 20.
Let's check if all numbers are used once: 97, 72, 90, 85. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, -. Yes.

Let's write down the steps clearly.
1. Calculate the difference between 97 and 72.
2. Calculate the difference between 90 and 85.
3. Subtract the result of step 2 from the result of step 1.

Step 1: 97 - 72 = 25
Step 2: 90 - 85 = 5
Step 3: 25 - 5 = 20

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's try another approach to be sure.
What if I try to make a number that divides into another to get 20?
For example, if I can make 4, then 80 / 4 = 20.
Can I make 80 from three numbers?
97 - 17? No.
85 - 5? No.
72 + 8? No.
90 - 10? No.

What if I try to make a number that, when multiplied by something, gives 20?
For example, if I can make 4, then 4 * 5 = 20.
Can I make 4 from three numbers?
97 - 85 - 8 = 4? No.
90 / ? = 4? No.

Let's try to use division in a different way.
Maybe something like (A + B) / C = 20 or (A - B) / C = 20.
Or A / (B - C) = 20.

Let's try to make a denominator that divides one of the numbers to get something useful.
If the denominator is 4, then 80 / 4 = 20.
If the denominator is 5, then 100 / 5 = 20.
If the denominator is 10, then 200 / 10 = 20.

Let's try to make 5 as a denominator.
Can I make 5 from three numbers?
97 - 85 - 7 = 5? No.
90 - 72 - 13 = 5? No.
85 - 72 - ? = 5? 13 - ? = 5, so ? = 8. No.

Let's try to make 4 as a denominator.
Can I make 4 from three numbers?
97 - 85 - 8 = 4? No.
90 - 72 - 14 = 4? No.

Let's go back to the first solution found: (97 - 72) - (90 - 85) = 20.
This uses all numbers and only allowed operations.

Let's explore other possibilities just in case.
What if we try to get a number close to 20 by multiplication?

Let's try to combine numbers to get a multiple of 20.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible combinations and operations:
- Try to get close to 14 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.
- (59 - 48) = 11. Remaining numbers are 34, 58. Can I get 3 from 34 and 58? (58 / 34) is not an integer. (58 - 34) = 24. (34 - 58) is negative. (58 * 34) is too large.

The problem requires me to form a valid arithmetic equation using the numbers 78, 41, and 37 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, and /. The target result is 74.

I need to explore different combinations of numbers and operations. Since there are three numbers, there will be two operations. The order of operations matters, so I should consider parentheses as well, although the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention them. However, standard arithmetic rules apply, so multiplication and division will be performed before addition and subtraction unless parentheses dictate otherwise.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 78, N2 = 41, N3 = 37.
Target = 74.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3
2. N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)
3. N1 op1 N2 op2 N3 (without explicit parentheses, relying on order of operations)

Let's try combinations systematically.

I need to combine these three numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to reach 84.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with multiplication:**
    *   48 * 2 = 96. How to get from 96 to 84 using 18? 96 - 18 = 78. Not 84.
    *   48 * 18 is too large.
    *   18 * 2 = 36. How to get from 36 to 84 using 48? 36 + 48 = 84. This works!

Let's verify:
The numbers used are 18, 2, and 48.
The operations used are multiplication and addition.
The equation is (18 * 2) + 48.
(18 * 2) = 36.
36 + 48 = 84.

This equation uses all numbers (2, 48, 18) exactly once and results in 84 using basic operations.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, though the first one found is valid.

2.  **Start with division:**
    *   48 / 2 = 24. How to get from 24 to 84 using 18? 24 + 18 = 42 (too low). 24 * 18 is too large.
    *   48 / 18 is not a whole number, so likely not intended.
    *   18 / 2 = 9. How to get from 9 to 84 using 48? 9 + 48 = 57 (too low). 9 * 48 is too large.

3.  **Start with addition/subtraction:**
    *   48 + 18 = 66. How to get from 66 to 84 using 2? 66 + 2 = 68 (too low). 66 * 2 = 132 (too high). 66 - 2 = 64 (too low).
    *   48 - 18 = 30. How to get from 30 to 84 using 2? 30 * 2 = 60 (too low). 30 + 2 = 32 (too low).
    *   48 + 2 = 50. How to get from 50 to 84 using 18? 50 + 18 = 68 (too low). 50 * 18 is too large.
    *   48 - 2 = 46. How to get from 46 to 84 using 18? 46 + 18 = 64 (too low). 46 * 18 is too large.
    *   18 + 2 = 20. How to get from 20 to 84 using 48? 20 + 48 = 68 (too low). 20 * 48 is too large.
    *   18 - 2 = 16. How to get from 16 to 84 using 48? 16 + 48 = 64 (too low). 16 * 48 is too large.

The combination (18 * 2) + 48 = 84 seems to be the most straightforward and correct solution.

Multiplication and division might be more complex.

63 / 54 (no)
77 / 63 (no)
77 / 54 (no)
54 / 63 (no)
54 / 77 (no)

So, division is unlikely to be a primary operation unless it's part of a larger expression that cancels out remainders, which is less likely with only three numbers and basic operations.

The simplest solution found is (77 + 63) - 54.
Let's confirm the order of operations. Addition and subtraction have the same precedence, so they are evaluated from left to right.
77 + 63 - 54 = 140 - 54 = 86.

I need to try different combinations and operations.

Possible starting points:
- Combine two numbers first, then use the remaining two.
- Combine three numbers first, then use the last one.

Let's try combining 55 and 53:
- 55 + 53 = 108. Remaining: [37, 40]. Target from 108: 79. Need to get -29 from [37, 40]. 37 - 40 = -3. 40 - 37 = 3. 37 * 40 = 1480. 37 / 40 is not an integer. 40 / 37 is not an integer. This path doesn't seem easy.
- 55 - 53 = 2. Remaining: [37, 40]. Target from 2: 79. Need to get 77 from [37, 40]. 37 + 40 = 77. This looks promising!
So, (55 - 53) + (37 + 40) = 2 + 77 = 79.
This uses all numbers [55, 53, 37, 40] exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 55, 53, 37, 40 (all used once)
Operations used: -, +, + (basic arithmetic)
Result: (55 - 53) + (37 + 40) = 2 + 77 = 79.

This equation works.

Let's try another combination just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.
- 55 * 53 = 2915. Remaining: [37, 40]. Target from 2915: 79. Need to get -2836 from [37, 40]. Unlikely.
- 55 / 53 is not an integer.

Equation: (37 + 40) + (55 - 53) = 77 + 2 = 79.
This is the same as the first one found, just with the first two terms swapped.

Let's try multiplication first.
- 55 * (something)
- 53 * (something)
- 37 * (something)
- 40 * (something)

Consider 40 * 2 = 80. Can we get 2 from [55, 53, 37]?
55 - 53 = 2. Then we have 37 left.
So, 40 * (55 - 53) = 40 * 2 = 80. We have 37 left. We need 79. 80 - 37 = 43. 80 + 37 = 117.
This doesn't work directly.

What if we use division?
Maybe something like (X / Y) + Z + W = 79.
Or X - (Y / Z) + W = 79.

Let's revisit the successful ones:
1. (55 - 53) + (37 + 40) = 79
2. (55 + 37) - (53 - 40) = 79

Let's try some combinations:

2. 49 + 37 - 1 = 85. Close, but not 86.
3. 49 * 1 + 37 = 49 + 37 = 86. This works! It uses 49, 1, and 37 exactly once and results in 86.

Let's double check the rules:
- Every number in the input list must be used exactly once: Yes, 49, 1, and 37 are used.
- Only the standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are allowed: Yes, only * and + are used.
- The result is 86: Yes, 49 * 1 + 37 = 49 + 37 = 86.

The equation is (30 / 15) * 19 = 38.

What if subtraction is involved to reduce a larger number?
Maybe something like (30 * 19) - X = 38? No, X would be too large.
Maybe something like (19 * 30) / X = 38? 570 / X = 38. X = 570 / 38 = 15. This uses 19, 30, 15. So (19 * 30) / 15 = 570 / 15 = 38. This also works.

1766,152,"<think>The problem asks for an equation that uses the numbers 17, 72, and 38 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to produce the result 17.

Let the numbers be $a=17$, $b=72$, and $c=38$. We need to find an arrangement of these numbers and operations such that the result is 17.

Let's explore different combinations and orders of operations.

Possible structures:
1. $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c$
2. $a \text{ op1 } (b \text{ op2 } c)$

Let's try to get close to 17.
The target is 17.

Consider the number 17 itself. If we can isolate 17 and then add/subtract/multiply/divide by something that results in 0 or 1, that would be a good strategy.

Possibility 1: Start with 17.
If we have $17 \text{ op1 } (\dots)$, we need the $(\dots)$ part to evaluate to 0 if op1 is + or -, or to 1 if op1 is *. Division by 17 is also an option.

Let's try to make 0 from 72 and 38.
$72 - 38 = 34$ (not 0)
$72 + 38 = 110$ (not 0)
$72 * 38 = 2736$ (not 0)
$72 / 38$ (not an integer, not 0)
$38 - 72 = -34$ (not 0)
$38 / 72$ (not an integer, not 0)

So, making 0 from 72 and 38 directly doesn't seem to work.

Let's try to make 1 from 72 and 38.
$72 / 72 = 1$ (but we need to use 38)
$38 / 38 = 1$ (but we need to use 72)

Let's try different combinations:

1.  (49 + 51) + 84 = 100 + 84 = 184 (Too high)
2.  (49 + 51) - 84 = 100 - 84 = 16 (Too low)

5.  (51 - 49) + 84 = 2 + 84 = 86 (Close, but not 82)

8.  49 + 51 - 84 = 16 (Too low)
9.  49 - 51 + 84 = -2 + 84 = 82 (This works!)

11. 51 - 49 + 84 = 2 + 84 = 86 (Close)
12. 51 - 49 - 84 = 2 - 84 = -82 (Close, but negative)

Let's try multiplication and division.

13. 49 * 51 ... (This will be very large, unlikely to get to 82 with subtraction of 84)
14. 49 / 51 ... (Fraction, unlikely to work easily)
15. 51 / 49 ... (Fraction, unlikely to work easily)
16. 84 / 49 ... (Fraction, unlikely to work easily)
17. 84 / 51 ... (Fraction, unlikely to work easily)

Let's re-examine the successful addition/subtraction combinations.
We found:
(49 - 51) + 84 = 82
49 - 51 + 84 = 82

These are essentially the same calculation due to order of operations.
Let's check if there are other ways.

What if 84 is involved in multiplication or division first?
(49 + 51) * 84 = 100 * 84 = 8400 (Too high)
(49 - 51) * 84 = -2 * 84 = -168 (Too low)
(51 - 49) * 84 = 2 * 84 = 168 (Too high)

49 + (51 * 84) = 49 + 4284 = 4333 (Too high)
49 - (51 * 84) = 49 - 4284 = -4235 (Too low)
51 + (49 * 84) = 51 + 4116 = 4167 (Too high)
51 - (49 * 84) = 51 - 4116 = -4065 (Too low)

49 + (84 / 51) ... (Fraction)
49 - (84 / 51) ... (Fraction)
51 + (84 / 49) ... (Fraction)
51 - (84 / 49) ... (Fraction)

Let's try division involving the smaller numbers.
(49 / 84) + 51 ... (Fraction)
(51 / 84) + 49 ... (Fraction)

What about division where the result is an integer?
84 / ? = integer.
84 / 4 = 21
84 / 6 = 14
84 / 7 = 12
84 / 12 = 7
84 / 14 = 6
84 / 21 = 4
84 / 28 = 3
84 / 42 = 2

None of these divisors (4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42) can be formed by combining 49 and 51 using one operation.
49+51 = 100
49-51 = -2
51-49 = 2
49*51 = 2499
49/51 = fraction
51/49 = fraction

Let's consider the structure (A op B) op C = 82.
We found (49 - 51) + 84 = 82. This is a valid solution.
Let's check if there are others.

What if 84 is the first number?
84 + 49 - 51 = 133 - 51 = 82 (This works!)
84 - 49 + 51 = 35 + 51 = 86 (Close)
84 + 51 - 49 = 135 - 49 = 86 (Close)
84 - 51 + 49 = 33 + 49 = 82 (This works!)

So we have found:
1. (49 - 51) + 84 = 82
2. 49 - 51 + 84 = 82
3. 84 + 49 - 51 = 82
4. 84 - 51 + 49 = 82

All these are valid. I will pick one.
Let's use 84 - 51 + 49.
84 - 51 = 33
33 + 49 = 82.
This uses 84, 51, and 49 exactly once with subtraction and addition.

Another option: 49 + 84 - 51
49 + 84 = 133
133 - 51 = 82.
This also works.

Let's try to use multiplication or division.
Could we get 82 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the third?
49 * 51 = 2499 (too big)
49 * 84 = 4116 (too big)
51 * 84 = 4284 (too big)

Could we get 82 by dividing two numbers and then adding/subtracting the third?
84 / 49 = 1.71...
84 / 51 = 1.64...
49 / 84 = 0.58...
51 / 84 = 0.60...
49 / 51 = 0.96...
51 / 49 = 1.04...

None of these divisions result in integers that would easily lead to 82.

Let's consider division as the last operation.
(A op B) / C = 82
(49 + 51) / ? = 100 / ? = 82 (No integer divisor)
(49 - 51) / ? = -2 / ? = 82 (No integer divisor)
(51 - 49) / ? = 2 / ? = 82 (No integer divisor)

Let's consider division as the first operation.
A / B op C = 82
84 / 49 op 51 = 1.71... op 51 (Unlikely)
84 / 51 op 49 = 1.64... op 49 (Unlikely)

It seems the addition/subtraction combinations are the most straightforward.
I will present one of the valid solutions.
84 - 51 + 49 = 82.
This uses 84, 51, 49, subtraction, and addition.

Let's double check the requirements:

4793,670,"<think>The numbers are 66, 68, and 26. The target is 52.
I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's try combinations:
1.  Start with the largest numbers:
    *   68 - 66 = 2. Then I have 2 and 26. 2 * 26 = 52. This works.
    *   68 + 66 = 134. Then I have 134 and 26. 134 - 26 = 108. 134 + 26 = 160. 134 / 26 (not integer). 134 * 26 (too large).
    *   68 * 66 (too large).
    *   68 / 66 (not integer).

2.  Try other combinations:
    *   66 - 26 = 40. Then I have 40 and 68. 68 - 40 = 28. 68 + 40 = 108. 68 * 40 (too large). 68 / 40 (not integer).
    *   66 + 26 = 92. Then I have 92 and 68. 92 - 68 = 24. 92 + 68 = 160. 92 * 68 (too large). 92 / 68 (not integer).
    *   66 * 26 (too large).
    *   66 / 26 (not integer).

    *   68 - 26 = 42. Then I have 42 and 66. 66 - 42 = 24. 66 + 42 = 108. 66 * 42 (too large). 66 / 42 (not integer).
    *   68 + 26 = 94. Then I have 94 and 66. 94 - 66 = 28. 94 + 66 = 160. 94 * 66 (too large). 94 / 66 (not integer).
    *   68 * 26 (too large).
    *   68 / 26 (not integer).

The first combination found seems to be the only one that works: 68 - 66 = 2, and then 2 * 26 = 52.
This can be written as (68 - 66) * 26.
Let's check if the order of operations matters for the final expression.
(68 - 66) * 26 = 2 * 26 = 52. This uses all numbers and allowed operations.

The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers 67, 50, and 63 to equal 54.
I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [67, 50, 63]
Target value: 54

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation has 4 choices. This gives a large number of possibilities, but I can try to be strategic.

Let's consider the target number 54. It's a relatively small number compared to the input numbers. This suggests that subtraction or division might be important to reduce the values.

Let's try some combinations, focusing on getting close to 54.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 67.
- 67 - ? = 54. This would require 13. Can I make 13 from 50 and 63?
  - 63 - 50 = 13. Yes!
  So, the equation could be 67 - (63 - 50).
  Let's check: 67 - (63 - 50) = 67 - 13 = 54.
  This uses 67, 63, and 50 exactly once.
  The operations used are subtraction. This fits the criteria.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough and confirm this is a good approach.

Possibility 2: Start with 63.
- 63 - ? = 54. This would require 9. Can I make 9 from 67 and 50?
  - 67 - 50 = 17 (not 9)
  - 50 - 67 = -17 (not 9)
  - 67 + 50 = 117 (not 9)
  - 67 * 50 = 3350 (not 9)
  - 67 / 50 (not integer)
  - 50 / 67 (not integer)
  So, 63 - (something from 67 and 50) doesn't seem to work easily.

Possibility 3: Start with 50.
- 50 + ? = 54. This would require 4. Can I make 4 from 67 and 63?
  - 67 - 63 = 4. Yes!
  So, the equation could be 50 + (67 - 63).
  Let's check: 50 + (67 - 63) = 50 + 4 = 54.
  This uses 50, 67, and 63 exactly once.
  The operations used are addition and subtraction. This also fits the criteria.

Both 67 - (63 - 50) and 50 + (67 - 63) work. The user asked for *an* arithmetic equation. I will present one of them. The first one I found, 67 - (63 - 50), is perfectly valid.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Numbers used: [67, 50, 63] - Yes, all used exactly once.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - Yes, only subtraction is used.
- Target value: 54 - Yes, the equation evaluates to 54.

The structure 67 - (63 - 50) is clear and directly leads to the answer.
The structure 50 + (67 - 63) is also clear and directly leads to the answer.

I will choose the first one I found.

Let's consider other arrangements just to be sure there isn't a simpler or more elegant one, though simplicity wasn't a strict requirement.

What about multiplication or division?
- (67 * 50) / 63 - unlikely to be 54.
- (67 * 63) / 50 - unlikely to be 54.
- (50 * 63) / 67 - unlikely to be 54.

What about division first?
- 67 / (something)
- 50 / (something)
- 63 / (something)

Let's try to get a number close to 54 using two numbers and then adjust with the third.
- 67 - 50 = 17. Need to get 54 from 17 and 63. 17 + 63 = 80, 63 - 17 = 46, 17 - 63 = -46. No.
- 67 - 63 = 4. Need to get 54 from 4 and 50. 4 + 50 = 54. This is the second solution found: 50 + (67 - 63).
- 63 - 50 = 13. Need to get 54 from 13 and 67. 67 - 13 = 54. This is the first solution found: 67 - (63 - 50).
- 67 + 50 = 117. Need to get 54 from 117 and 63. 117 - 63 = 54. This is another valid solution: (67 + 50) - 63.
  Let's check: (67 + 50) - 63 = 117 - 63 = 54. This also works.

- 67 + 63 = 130. Need to get 54 from 130 and 50. 130 - 50 = 80. No.
- 50 + 63 = 113. Need to get 54 from 113 and 67. 113 - 67 = 46. No.

So I have found three valid solutions:
1. 67 - (63 - 50) = 54
2. 50 + (67 - 63) = 54
3. (67 + 50) - 63 = 54

All are valid. I will present the first one I found.
The thought process involved:
1. Understanding the constraints (numbers, operations, usage).
2. Identifying the target value.
3. Strategizing based on the target value (smaller than inputs suggests subtraction/division).
4. Trying combinations, starting with the largest number or simple differences/sums.
5. Verifying each potential solution against the constraints.
6. Selecting one valid solution.

The first solution found, 67 - (63 - 50), is a good candidate.
Let's write down the steps clearly.
Step 1: Identify the numbers [67, 50, 63] and the target value 54.
Step 2: Consider operations that can reduce larger numbers to a smaller target. Subtraction is a good candidate.
Step 3: Try starting with the largest number, 67. If we subtract a value from 67 to get 54, that value must be 67 - 54 = 13.
Step 4: Check if the remaining numbers (50 and 63) can produce 13 using the allowed operations.
Step 5: Calculate 63 - 50 = 13. This works.
Step 6: Construct the equation: 67 - (63 - 50).
Step 7: Verify the equation: 67 - (63 - 50) = 67 - 13 = 54.
Step 8: Confirm all numbers [67, 50, 63] are used exactly once and only allowed operations are used. This is satisfied.

Let the three numbers be $a = 89$, $b = 80$, and $c = 51$. The target is $T = 60$.
We need to combine $a, b, c$ using +, -, *, / to get 60.
The possible structures of the equation will involve combining two numbers first, and then combining the result with the third number. There are $3! = 6$ permutations of the numbers, and for each permutation, there are several ways to apply the operations.

Let's list the possible pairings and operations:
1. $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c$
2. $a \text{ op1 } (b \text{ op2 } c)$

The operations can be any of +, -, *, /.

Let's try systematically.

**Consider the second structure: a op1 (b op2 c)**

Let's re-examine the successful combinations and see if they fit this structure.
The first solution was (89 - 80) + 51 = 60. This is of the form $(a - b) + c$.
The second solution was (89 + 51) - 80 = 60. This is of the form $(a + c) - b$.

Let's try to see if we can get 60 using multiplication or division in a way that reduces the numbers.

Consider the numbers: 89, 80, 51. Target: 60.
Notice that 80 and 51 are relatively close to multiples of 10 or 5.
80 is $8 \times 10$.
51 is $3 \times 17$.
89 is prime.

Let's try to get a number close to 60 by combining two numbers, and then adjust with the third.

What if we try to get a number that, when operated with the third, gives 60?

        *   Operations are addition and subtraction.
        *   This is also a valid solution.

    *   53 * ? = 33. ? = 33/53. Unlikely.
    *   53 / ? = 33. ? = 53/33. Unlikely.

4.  Try starting with 40.
    *   40 - ? = 33. ? = 7. Can we make 7 from 60 and 53?
        *   60 - 53 = 7. Yes!
        *   So, 40 - (60 - 53) = 40 - 7 = 33.
        *   This uses 40, 60, and 53 exactly once.
        *   Operations are subtraction and subtraction.
        *   This is also a valid solution.

    *   40 + ? = 33. ? = -7. Can we make -7 from 60 and 53?
        *   53 - 60 = -7. Yes!
        *   So, 40 + (53 - 60) = 40 + (-7) = 33.
        *   This uses 40, 53, and 60 exactly once.
        *   Operations are addition and subtraction.
        *   This is also a valid solution.

    *   40 * ? = 33. ? = 33/40. Unlikely.
    *   40 / ? = 33. ? = 40/33. Unlikely.

We have found multiple valid solutions. The simplest one is probably 53 - (60 - 40).
Let's verify:
53 - (60 - 40) = 53 - 20 = 33.
Numbers used: 53, 60, 40 (exactly once).
Operations used: -, - (basic operations).
Result: 33.

Another one: 40 - (60 - 53)
40 - (60 - 53) = 40 - 7 = 33.
Numbers used: 40, 60, 53 (exactly once).
Operations used: -, - (basic operations).
Result: 33.

Another one: 53 + (40 - 60)
53 + (40 - 60) = 53 + (-20) = 33.
Numbers used: 53, 40, 60 (exactly once).
Operations used: +, - (basic operations).
Result: 33.

Another one: 40 + (53 - 60)
40 + (53 - 60) = 40 + (-7) = 33.
Numbers used: 40, 53, 60 (exactly once).
Operations used: +, - (basic operations).
Result: 33.

I will choose one of the simpler ones. 53 - (60 - 40) is clear.
Or 40 - (60 - 53).

Let's try to use multiplication or division.
Can we get 33 by multiplying two numbers derived from the set?
e.g., (A op B) * (C op D) = 33. Not applicable here as we only have 3 numbers.

(60 + 53) / ? = 33 -> 113 / ? = 33 (No)
(53 - 40) / ? = 33 -> 13 / ? = 33 (No)

The problem asks for a mathematical equation using the numbers 73, 7, 9, and 36 exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /, to achieve the result 74.

Let the numbers be $n_1 = 73$, $n_2 = 7$, $n_3 = 9$, $n_4 = 36$.
We need to arrange these numbers and the operations to get 74.

Let's try different combinations and see if we can get close to 74.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

We have 4 numbers, so we will have 3 operations.

Let's consider the largest number, 73. We need to get to 74, so we need to add 1 or subtract -1.

Possibility 1: Start with 73.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 98, 88, and 25 exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, /, to equal 35.

Let's try combinations:

1.  (98 + 88) / 25 = 186 / 25 (not an integer, unlikely to be 35)
2.  (98 - 88) * 25 = 10 * 25 = 250 (too large)
3.  (98 - 88) / 25 = 10 / 25 (not an integer)

Let's analyze the numbers and the target. The target 69 is relatively small compared to the given numbers. This suggests that division or subtraction will likely play a significant role in reducing the values.

Possible strategies:
1.  **Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.**
2.  **Try to create intermediate numbers that are close to the target or can easily combine with other numbers to reach the target.**
3.  **Consider combinations that might result in numbers close to 69.**

Let's try some combinations:

*   **Using 93:**
    *   93 - ? = 69. This means ? = 93 - 69 = 24. Can I make 24 from [53, 71, 73]?
        *   53 + 71 + 73 = 197 (too large)
        *   73 - 53 = 20. Then 20 + 71 = 91 (not 24)
        *   71 - 53 = 18. Then 18 + 73 = 91 (not 24)
        *   73 - 71 = 2. Then 2 + 53 = 55 (not 24)
        *   53 / 71 (not integer)
        *   53 / 73 (not integer)
        *   71 / 53 (not integer)
        *   71 / 73 (not integer)
        *   73 / 53 (not integer)
        *   73 / 71 (not integer)
        *   53 * 71 (too large)
        *   53 * 73 (too large)
        *   71 * 73 (too large)
        *   It seems unlikely to make 24 from [53, 71, 73] using simple operations.

*   **Using 73:**
    *   73 - ? = 69. ? = 4. Can I make 4 from [53, 71, 93]?
        *   93 - 71 = 22. 22 - 53 (negative)
        *   71 - 53 = 18. 18 - 93 (negative)
        *   93 / ? = 4 (not integer)
        *   71 / ? = 4 (not integer)
        *   53 / ? = 4 (not integer)
        *   This also seems unlikely.

*   **Using 71:**
    *   71 - ? = 69. ? = 2. Can I make 2 from [53, 73, 93]?

        *   93 - 73 = 20. 20 - 53 (negative)
        *   93 - 53 = 40. 40 - 73 (negative)
        *   73 / ? = 2 (not integer)
        *   93 / ? = 2 (not integer)
        *   53 / ? = 2 (not integer)
        *   This also seems unlikely.

*   **Using 53:**
    *   53 + ? = 69. ? = 16. Can I make 16 from [71, 73, 93]?
        *   93 - 71 = 22. 22 - 73 (negative)
        *   73 - 71 = 2. 2 + 93 = 95 (not 16)
        *   93 / ? = 16 (not integer)
        *   73 / ? = 16 (not integer)
        *   71 / ? = 16 (not integer)
        *   This also seems unlikely.

Let's try combining numbers first to get smaller values.
The numbers are [53, 71, 73, 93]. Target is 69.

Consider division. If we divide a large number by a smaller one, we might get a useful intermediate result.
*   93 / 71 (not integer)
*   93 / 73 (not integer)
*   93 / 53 (not integer)
*   73 / 71 (not integer)
*   73 / 53 (not integer)
*   71 / 53 (not integer)

This means division is unlikely to be the first operation unless it's part of a larger expression that results in an integer.

Let's try to create numbers close to 69 or numbers that can be easily manipulated.
What if we try to make a number slightly larger than 69 and subtract?
Or a number slightly smaller and add?

Let's look at the last digits. Target ends in 9.
Numbers end in 3, 1, 3, 3.

Consider (71 + 73) = 144.
Consider (71 + 93) = 164.
Consider (73 + 93) = 166.

Consider subtractions:

(93 - 53) = 40
(73 - 71) = 2
(93 - 71) = 22

Let's list the numbers: {52, 92, 82}
Target value: 62

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can reach 62.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 62
2. a op (b op c) = 62

Let's try combinations with the largest number first, 92.

Attempt 1: Start with 92.
- If I subtract something from 92, I need to get 62. 92 - x = 62 => x = 30.
  Can I make 30 from 52 and 82?
  - 82 - 52 = 30. This looks promising!
  So, the equation could be 92 - (82 - 52).
  Let's check: 92 - (82 - 52) = 92 - 30 = 62.
  This uses 92, 82, and 52 exactly once. It uses subtraction twice. This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, although I've already found a valid one.

Attempt 2: Start with 82.
- If I add something to 82, it will be greater than 82, so that won't work to get 62.
- If I subtract something from 82, 82 - x = 62 => x = 20.
  Can I make 20 from 52 and 92?
  - 92 - 52 = 40 (not 20)
  - 52 - 92 = -40 (not 20)
  - 92 / 52 (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 20 easily)
  - 52 / 92 (not an integer)
  - 92 * 52 (too large)
  - 52 * 92 (too large)
  - 92 + 52 (too large)
  So, 82 - x = 62 doesn't seem to work easily.

Attempt 3: Start with 52.
- If I add something to 52, 52 + x = 62 => x = 10.
  Can I make 10 from 92 and 82?
  - 92 - 82 = 10. This also looks promising!
  So, the equation could be 52 + (92 - 82).
  Let's check: 52 + (92 - 82) = 52 + 10 = 62.
  This uses 52, 92, and 82 exactly once. It uses addition and subtraction. This is also a valid solution.

The user asked for *a* single valid equation. Both 92 - (82 - 52) = 62 and 52 + (92 - 82) = 62 are valid. I will present the first one I found.

Let's double-check the constraints:
- Single valid arithmetic equation: Yes.
- Incorporate all provided numbers [52 92 82]: Yes.
- Each number appearing only a single time: Yes.
- Yield the exact value of 62: Yes.
- Restricted to +, -, *, /: Yes.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe a number multiplied by a small result from others.

Can I adjust 77 to 62 using the same numbers? No, they are already used.

Let's try another combination.
(87 + 83) = 170
(80 + 72) = 152

Let's try a different structure.

2516,1755,"<think>The problem asks us to find an equation that equals 90 using the numbers 1, 26, and 64 exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, /.

The numbers are: 1, 26, 64.
The target is: 90.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's explore combinations of these numbers and operations. We have three numbers, so we'll be performing two operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try assigning the numbers to a, b, and c in different orders and with different operations.

Consider the largest number, 64.
If we multiply 64 by something, it will likely exceed 90 quickly unless we divide later.
64 * 1 = 64. Then we have 26 left. 64 + 26 = 90. This works!
Let's check if this uses all numbers and operations correctly.
Numbers used: 64, 1, 26. All used exactly once.
Operations used: *, +. These are fundamental arithmetic operations.
The equation is (64 * 1) + 26 = 90.

Let's verify this.
64 * 1 = 64.
64 + 26 = 90.
This is a valid solution.

Are there other possibilities? Let's explore to be thorough.

What if we start with 26?
26 * 1 = 26. Then we have 64 left. 26 + 64 = 90. This is the same solution, just ordered differently.
26 + 1 = 27. Then we have 64 left. 27 + 64 = 91 (close, but not 90). 64 - 27 = 37. 27 * 64 is too large. 64 / 27 is not an integer.
26 - 1 = 25. Then we have 64 left. 25 + 64 = 89 (close). 64 - 25 = 39. 25 * 64 is too large. 64 / 25 is not an integer.
26 * 64 is too large.
26 / 1 = 26. Then we have 64 left. 26 + 64 = 90. Same solution.
26 / 64 is not an integer.

What if we start with 1?
1 * 26 = 26. Then we have 64 left. 26 + 64 = 90. Same solution.
1 + 26 = 27. Then we have 64 left. 27 + 64 = 91.
1 - 26 = -25. Then we have 64 left. -25 + 64 = 39. 64 - (-25) = 89.
1 * 64 = 64. Then we have 26 left. 64 + 26 = 90. Same solution.
1 + 64 = 65. Then we have 26 left. 65 + 26 = 91. 65 - 26 = 39. 26 - 65 = -39. 65 * 26 is too large. 65 / 26 is not an integer.
1 - 64 = -63. Then we have 26 left. -63 + 26 = -37. 26 - (-63) = 89.

Let's consider division more carefully.
Can we get 90 by dividing?
If 64 is the dividend, 64 / x = 90. x = 64/90, not possible with 1 or 26.
If 26 is the dividend, 26 / x = 90. x = 26/90, not possible.
If 1 is the dividend, 1 / x = 90. x = 1/90, not possible.

What if division is the second operation?
(a op b) / c = 90.
(64 + 26) / 1 = 90 / 1 = 90. This uses 64, 26, 1, +, /. This is also a valid solution.
Let's check: (64 + 26) / 1 = 90. Numbers used: 64, 26, 1. Operations used: +, /.

(64 - 26) / 1 = 38 / 1 = 38.
(64 * 1) / 26 = 64 / 26 (not integer).
(64 / 1) / 26 = 64 / 26 (not integer).
(26 + 1) / 64 = 27 / 64 (not integer).
(26 - 1) / 64 = 25 / 64 (not integer).
(26 * 1) / 64 = 26 / 64 (not integer).
(26 / 1) / 64 = 26 / 64 (not integer).
(1 + 26) / 64 = 27 / 64 (not integer).
(1 - 26) / 64 = -25 / 64 (not integer).
(1 * 26) / 64 = 26 / 64 (not integer).
(1 / 26) / 64 (not integer).

What if division is the first operation?
a / (b op c) = 90.
64 / (26 + 1) = 64 / 27 (not integer).
64 / (26 - 1) = 64 / 25 (not integer).
64 / (26 * 1) = 64 / 26 (not integer).
64 / (26 / 1) = 64 / 26 (not integer).
26 / (64 + 1) = 26 / 65 (not integer).
26 / (64 - 1) = 26 / 63 (not integer).
26 / (64 * 1) = 26 / 64 (not integer).
26 / (64 / 1) = 26 / 64 (not integer).
1 / (64 + 26) = 1 / 90 (not integer).
1 / (64 - 26) = 1 / 38 (not integer).
1 / (64 * 26) (too small).
1 / (64 / 26) (not integer).

Let's re-examine the first solution found: (64 * 1) + 26 = 90.
This uses 64, 1, 26, *, +. It's simple and correct.

Let's re-examine the second solution found: (64 + 26) / 1 = 90.
This uses 64, 26, 1, +, /. It's also simple and correct.

The problem asks for *an* equation. Both are valid. The first one seems slightly more direct in terms of the numbers involved in the primary calculation.

Let's consider if there are any other combinations that might yield 90.
We have numbers 1, 26, 64.
Target: 90.

Possible intermediate results from two numbers:
1 + 26 = 27
1 - 26 = -25
1 * 26 = 26
1 / 26 (fraction)

1 + 64 = 65
1 - 64 = -63
1 * 64 = 64
1 / 64 (fraction)

26 + 64 = 90
26 - 64 = -38
26 * 64 (large)
26 / 64 (fraction)

Now combine these intermediate results with the remaining number.

Case 1: Intermediate result is 27 (from 1+26). Remaining number is 64.
27 + 64 = 91 (close)
27 - 64 = -37
64 - 27 = 37
27 * 64 (large)
64 / 27 (fraction)

Case 2: Intermediate result is -25 (from 1-26). Remaining number is 64.
-25 + 64 = ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
4715,1129,"<think>The target number is 32. The available numbers are 6, 77, 42, and 2. I need to use each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.

Let's try to combine the numbers.
The numbers 77 and 42 are quite large. 6 and 2 are smaller.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the large numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Combine the smaller numbers first and then integrate the larger ones.

Let's try combining 77 and 42.
77 + 42 = 119
77 - 42 = 35
42 - 77 = -35
77 * 42 = 3234
77 / 42 (not an integer)
42 / 77 (not an integer)

If we have 35 from 77 - 42, we need to get 32 from 35 using 6 and 2.
35 + 6 + 2 = 43 (too high)
35 + 6 - 2 = 39 (too high)
35 - 6 + 2 = 31 (close!)
35 - 6 - 2 = 27 (too low)
35 + (6/2) = 35 + 3 = 38 (too high)
35 - (6/2) = 35 - 3 = 32 (This works!)

So, the expression is (77 - 42) - (6 / 2).
Let's check if all numbers are used: 77, 42, 6, 2. Yes.
Let's check the operations: -, -, /. Yes.
Let's check the result: (77 - 42) - (6 / 2) = 35 - 3 = 32. Yes.

Let's try another combination just to be sure.
What if we use 42 and 6 first?
42 / 6 = 7. We have 77 and 2 left. We need to get 32 from 7, 77, 2.
7 + 77 + 2 = 86
7 + 77 - 2 = 82
7 - 77 + 2 = -68
7 - 77 - 2 = -72
7 * 77 + 2 = 539 + 2 = 541
7 * 77 - 2 = 539 - 2 = 537
7 + (77/2) (not integer)
(77/7) * 2 = 11 * 2 = 22 (need 32)
(77-2) / 7 = 75 / 7 (not integer)
(77+2) / 7 = 79 / 7 (not integer)

What if we use 42 and 2 first?
42 / 2 = 21. We have 77 and 6 left. We need to get 32 from 21, 77, 6.
21 + 77 + 6 = 104
21 + 77 - 6 = 92
21 - 77 + 6 = -50
21 - 77 - 6 = -62
21 + (77/6) (not integer)
21 + (6/77) (not integer)
(77-21) + 6 = 56 + 6 = 62
(77-21) - 6 = 56 - 6 = 50
(77+21) - 6 = 98 - 6 = 92
(77+21) + 6 = 98 + 6 = 104
(77/?)

Let's go back to the first successful attempt.
(77 - 42) - (6 / 2) = 32.
This uses all numbers [6, 77, 42, 2] exactly once.
It uses only basic arithmetic operations.
The result is 32.

Let's consider other ways to group (77 - 42) - (6 / 2).
Is (77 - 42) - 6 / 2 the same? Yes, due to order of operations.
Is 77 - 42 - 6 / 2 the same? Yes.

What about other combinations of 77, 42, 6, 2?
Try multiplication with smaller numbers.
6 * 2 = 12. We have 77 and 42 left. Need 32 from 12, 77, 42.
77 - 42 + 12 = 35 + 12 = 47
77 - 42 - 12 = 35 - 12 = 23
42 - 12 + 77 = 30 + 77 = 107
42 - 12 - 77 = 30 - 77 = -47
(77+42) - 12 = 119 - 12 = 107
(77-12) - 42 = 65 - 42 = 23
(42-12) + 77 = 30 + 77 = 107

Try 6 / 2 = 3. We have 77 and 42 left. Need 32 from 3, 77, 42.
77 - 42 + 3 = 35 + 3 = 38
77 - 42 - 3 = 35 - 3 = 32. This is the same solution as before, just written differently. (77 - 42) - (6 / 2).

Try 42 / 6 = 7. We have 77 and 2 left. Need 32 from 7, 77, 2.
77 - (7 * 2) = 77 - 14 = 63
77 - (7 + 2) = 77 - 9 = 68
77 - (7 - 2) = 77 - 5 = 72
(77/?)

Try 42 / 2 = 21. We have 77 and 6 left. Need 32 from 21, 77, 6.
77 - 21 - 6 = 56 - 6 = 50
77 - (21 + 6) = 77 - 27 = 50
77 - (21 - 6) = 77 - 15 = 62
21 + 6 + ?
21 + 6 = 27. Need 32 from 27 and 77. 77 - 27 = 50.

Try 77 / ?
77 / 6 (not integer)
77 / 2 (not integer)

Let's consider the structure of the target number 32.
It's relatively small. This suggests that we might need subtraction or division to reduce larger numbers.

We found (77 - 42) - (6 / 2) = 32.
This is a valid solution.

4763,689,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 66, 44, 90, and 4 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target number 20. I need to explore various combinations and order of operations.

Let's list the numbers: [66, 44, 90, 4]
Target: 20

I should consider different groupings and the order of operations. Parentheses will be important.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create intermediate numbers that are factors or multiples of others.
3. Look for combinations that might result in numbers close to 20.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using division early.
- 66 / 44 is not an integer.
- 66 / 4 is not an integer.
- 44 / 4 = 11. Now I have [66, 90, 11] and need to get 20.
  - 66 + 90 + 11 = 167 (too large)
  - 90 - 66 + 11 = 24 + 11 = 35 (too large)
  - 90 + 11 - 66 = 101 - 66 = 35 (too large)
  - 66 - 11 + 90 = 55 + 90 = 145 (too large)
  - 90 / 11 is not integer.
  - 66 * 11 = 726 (too large)
  - 90 * 11 = 990 (too large)
  - 66 * 90 = 5940 (too large)
  - (90 - 66) * 11 = 24 * 11 = 264 (too large)
  - (90 + 66) / 11 = 156 / 11 (not integer)
  - (66 - 90) / 11 (negative)
  - (90 - 11) * 66 = 79 * 66 (too large)
  - (66 - 11) * 90 = 55 * 90 (too large)
  - 90 / (66 - 11) = 90 / 55 (not integer)
  - 66 / (90 - 11) = 66 / 79 (not integer)
  - 11 / (90 - 66) = 11 / 24 (not integer)

Let's try 44 / 4 = 11 again, but combine differently.
Numbers: [66, 90, 11]
Target: 20
- 90 - 66 = 24. Now I have [24, 11]. 24 - 11 = 13. Not 20.
- 90 + 66 = 156. Now I have [156, 11]. 156 / 11 (not integer). 156 - 11 = 145. 156 + 11 = 167.
- 66 - 90 = -24. Now I have [-24, 11]. -24 + 11 = -13. -24 - 11 = -35.
- 90 * 11 = 990. Now I have [66, 990].
- 66 * 11 = 726. Now I have [90, 726].

Let's try 90 / 4 is not integer.
Let's try 66 / 90 is not integer.
Let's try 44 / 90 is not integer.

Attempt 2: Using multiplication.
- 66 * 4 = 264. Numbers [264, 44, 90]. Target 20.
  - 264 - 44 = 220. Numbers [220, 90]. 220 - 90 = 130. 220 + 90 = 310. 220 / 90 (not integer).
  - 264 + 44 = 308. Numbers [308, 90].
  - 264 / 44 = 6. Numbers [6, 90]. Target 20.
    - 90 - 6 = 84.
    - 90 + 6 = 96.
    - 90 * 6 = 540.
    - 90 / 6 = 15. Close! But not 20.

Let's re-evaluate 264 / 44 = 6. Numbers [6, 90].
What if I used the 4 differently?
(66 * 4) / 44 = 264 / 44 = 6. Numbers [6, 90]. Still 15.

Let's try 44 * 4 = 176. Numbers [66, 90, 176]. Target 20.
- 176 - 90 = 86. Numbers [66, 86]. 86 - 66 = 20. Found it!
The expression is (44 * 4) - 90 + 66.
Let's check:
(44 * 4) = 176
176 - 90 = 86
86 + 66 = 152. This is not 20. My arithmetic was wrong. 86 + 66 = 152.

Let's re-check 86 - 66 = 20. Yes, that's correct.
So, the numbers are [66, 90, 176]. I need to combine 66 and 90 with 176 to get 20.
I had 176. I need to get from 176 to 20 using 66 and 90.
176 - 90 = 86. Then I have 66. 86 - 66 = 20.
So the expression is (44 * 4) - 90 - 66.
Let's check:
(44 * 4) = 176
176 - 90 = 86
86 - 66 = 20.
This uses 44, 4, 90, 66 exactly once. The operations are *, -, -. This is a valid solution.

Let's try another path to be sure.

Attempt 3: Using subtraction to get smaller numbers.
- 90 - 66 = 24. Numbers [24, 44, 4]. Target 20.
  - 44 - 24 = 20. Numbers [20, 4].
    - 20 + 4 = 24.
    - 20 - 4 = 16.
    - 20 * 4 = 80.

The user wants me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers [84, 74, 70, 10] and the operations +, -, *, / to reach the target value of 66. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 84, 74, 70, 10
Target: 66

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations. I'll try to get close to 66 and then see if the remaining numbers can adjust it.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create smaller numbers that can be combined.
3. Look for divisions that result in whole numbers or useful fractions.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1: Using multiplication first.
(84 * ?) - ? + ? = 66
(74 * ?) - ? + ? = 66
(70 * ?) - ? + ? = 66
(10 * ?) - ? + ? = 66

Let's try combining 84 and 10.
84 / 10 is not a whole number.
84 * 10 = 840 (too big)
84 + 10 = 94
84 - 10 = 74

If I have 74, and the remaining numbers are 70 and 10.
Can I get 66 from 74, 70, 10?
74 - 70 = 4. Remaining is 10. 4 + 10 = 14. Not 66.
74 + 70 = 144. Remaining is 10. 144 - 10 = 134. Not 66.
74 - 10 = 64. Remaining is 70. 64 + 70 = 134. Not 66.
74 + 10 = 84. Remaining is 70. 84 - 70 = 14. Not 66.

Let's try combining 74 and 10.
74 / 10 is not a whole number.
74 * 10 = 740 (too big)
74 + 10 = 84
74 - 10 = 64

If I have 64, and the remaining numbers are 84 and 70.
Can I get 66 from 64, 84, 70?
64 + 84 = 148. Remaining is 70. 148 - 70 = 78. Not 66.
64 - 84 = -20. Remaining is 70. -20 + 70 = 50. Not 66.
64 + 70 = 134. Remaining is 84. 134 - 84 = 50. Not 66.
64 - 70 = -6. Remaining is 84. -6 + 84 = 78. Not 66.

Let's try combining 70 and 10.
70 / 10 = 7. Remaining numbers are 84 and 74.
Can I get 66 from 7, 84, 74?
7 + 84 = 91. Remaining is 74. 91 - 74 = 17. Not 66.
7 - 84 = -77. Remaining is 74. -77 + 74 = -3. Not 66.
7 + 74 = 81. Remaining is 84. 81 - 84 = -3. Not 66.
7 - 74 = -67. Remaining is 84. -67 + 84 = 17. Not 66.
84 - 7 = 77. Remaining is 74. 77 - 74 = 3. Not 66.
84 + 7 = 91. Remaining is 74. 91 - 74 = 17. Not 66.
74 - 7 = 67. Remaining is 84. 67 + 84 = 151. Not 66.
74 + 7 = 81. Remaining is 84. 81 - 84 = -3. Not 66.

Let's try (70 / 10) = 7.
Now I have 7, 84, 74. Target 66.
What if I do 84 - 74 = 10. Then I have 7 and 10. 7 + 10 = 17. No.
What if I do 84 + 74 = 158. Then I have 7 and 158. 158 - 7 = 151. No.

Let's try another division: 70 / ?
70 / 84 (fraction)
70 / 74 (fraction)
70 / 10 = 7 (already tried)

Let's try 84 / ?
84 / 10 (fraction)
84 / 74 (fraction)
84 / 70 (fraction)

Let's try 74 / ?
74 / 10 (fraction)
74 / 84 (fraction)
74 / 70 (fraction)

Let's try 10 / ?
10 / 84 (fraction)
10 / 74 (fraction)
10 / 70 (fraction)

It seems direct division of two numbers from the set might not be the primary step unless it results in a useful integer.

Let's try combining numbers to get something close to 66.
84 - 10 = 74. Remaining: 74, 70.
74 - 70 = 4. So (84 - 10) - (74 - 70) = 74 - 4 = 70. Not 66.
(84 - 10) + (74 - 70) = 74 + 4 = 78. Not 66.

Let's try 74 - 10 = 64. Remaining: 84, 70.
64 + 84 - 70 = 148 - 70 = 78. Not 66.
64 - 84 + 70 = -20 + 70 = 50. Not 66.
64 + 70 - 84 = 134 - 84 = 50. Not 66.

Let's try 70 - 10 = 60. Remaining: 84, 74.
60 + 84 - 74 = 144 - 74 = 70. Not 66.
60 - 84 + 74 = -24 + 74 = 50. Not 66.
60 + 74 - 84 = 134 - 84 = 50. Not 66.

Let's try 84 - 74 = 10. Remaining: 70, 10.
10 + 70 - 10 = 70. Not 66.
10 - 70 + 10 = -50. Not 66.

Let's try 84 - 70 = 14. Remaining: 74, 10.
14 + 74 - 10 = 88 - 10 = 78. Not 66.
14 - 74 + 10 = -60 + 10 = -50. Not 66.
14 + 10 - 74 = 24 - 74 = -50. Not 66.

Let's try 74 - 70 = 4. Remaining: 84, 10.
4 + 84 - 10 = 88 - 10 = 78. Not 66.
4 - 84 + 10 = -80 + 10 = -70. Not 66.
4 + 10 - 84 = 14 - 84 = -70. Not 66.

Let's consider multiplication with smaller numbers.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  (15 + 6) + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22. This works!
2.  (15 + 6) - 1 = 21 - 1 = 20.
3.  (15 - 6) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.
4.  (15 - 6) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8.

6.  (15 * 6) - 1 = 90 - 1 = 89.
7.  (15 / 6) + 1 = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5. (Division might not be ideal if it results in non-integers unless it's part of a larger integer calculation).
8.  (15 / 6) - 1 = 2.5 - 1 = 1.5.
9.  15 + (6 + 1) = 15 + 7 = 22. This also works.

17. 6 + (15 + 1) = 6 + 16 = 22. This also works.
18. 6 + (15 - 1) = 6 + 14 = 20.
19. 6 - (15 + 1) = 6 - 16 = -10.
20. 6 - (15 - 1) = 6 - 14 = -8.
21. 6 * (15 + 1) = 6 * 16 = 96.
22. 6 * (15 - 1) = 6 * 14 = 84.
23. 6 / (15 + 1) = 6 / 16.
24. 6 / (15 - 1) = 6 / 14.
25. 1 + (15 + 6) = 1 + 21 = 22. This also works.
26. 1 + (15 - 6) = 1 + 9 = 10.
27. 1 - (15 + 6) = 1 - 21 = -20.
28. 1 - (15 - 6) = 1 - 9 = -8.
29. 1 * (15 + 6) = 1 * 21 = 21.

31. 1 / (15 + 6) = 1 / 21.
32. 1 / (15 - 6) = 1 / 9.

The simplest one found is (15 + 6) + 1 = 22.
Let's verify: 15 + 6 = 21. 21 + 1 = 22. All numbers (15, 6, 1) are used exactly once. Operations are valid.

Another one: 15 + (6 + 1) = 22.
Verify: 6 + 1 = 7. 15 + 7 = 22. All numbers used once. Operations valid.

Another one: 6 + (15 + 1) = 22.
Verify: 15 + 1 = 16. 6 + 16 = 22. All numbers used once. Operations valid.

Another one: 1 + (15 + 6) = 22.
Verify: 15 + 6 = 21. 1 + 21 = 22. All numbers used once. Operations valid.

I will choose the first one found.
Equation: (15 + 6) + 1 = 22.
Numbers used: 15, 6, 1 (exactly once).
Operations used: +, + (valid).
Result: 22.
Verification: 15 + 6 = 21. 21 + 1 = 22. Correct.

Let's consider if there are any other simple ones.
What about multiplication?
(15 * 1) + 6 = 15 + 6 = 21. No.
(6 * 1) + 15 = 6 + 15 = 21. No.
15 + 6 * 1 = 15 + 6 = 21. No.
6 + 15 * 1 = 6 + 15 = 21. No.

What about subtraction?
15 + 6 - 1 = 21 - 1 = 20. No.
15 - 6 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. No.
6 + 15 - 1 = 21 - 1 = 20. No.
6 - 15 + 1 = -9 + 1 = -8. No.
1 + 15 + 6 = 22. (Already found)
1 + 15 - 6 = 16 - 6 = 10. No.
1 - 15 + 6 = -14 + 6 = -8. No.

The simplest and most direct one is (15 + 6) + 1.
Or even simpler, 15 + 6 + 1, as addition is associative.
However, to be explicit with parentheses, (15 + 6) + 1 is good.
Or 15 + (6 + 1).

Let's check if any division could work.
(15 / 1) + 6 = 15 + 6 = 21. No.
(6 / 1) + 15 = 6 + 15 = 21. No.
15 + (6 / 1) = 15 + 6 = 21. No.
6 + (15 / 1) = 6 + 15 = 21. No.

What if 1 is used as a divisor?
15 + 6 / 1 = 15 + 6 = 21. No.
6 + 15 / 1 = 6 + 15 = 21. No.

What if 6 is used as a divisor?
15 + 1 / 6. Not integer.
1 + 15 / 6. Not integer.

What if 15 is used as a divisor?
6 + 1 / 15. Not integer.
1 + 6 / 15. Not integer.

It seems the addition-only solutions are the most straightforward.
(15 + 6) + 1 = 22.
15 + (6 + 1) = 22.
6 + (15 + 1) = 22.
1 + (15 + 6) = 22.

I will present (15 + 6) + 1.

Let's list the numbers: [77, 76, 11, 62].

2807,611,"<think>The problem asks me to find an equation using the numbers 81, 23, and 84, along with the operations +, -, *, /, that evaluates to 69. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [81, 23, 84]
Target value: 69
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /

I need to combine these three numbers using two operations to reach 69. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers. For each permutation, there are 4 possible combinations of two operations (e.g., op1, op2). So, there are 6 * 4 = 24 potential combinations to check.

Let's try different combinations systematically.

**Strategy 1: Start with the largest number (84) and see how to adjust it.**

*   **Permutation 1: 81, 23, 84**

        *   58 / 84 (not an integer)
    *   (81 * 23) ? 84 = 1863 ? 84. (way too high)
    *   (81 / 23) ? 84 (not an integer)

*   **Permutation 2: 81, 84, 23**
    *   (81 + 84) ? 23 = 165 ? 23.
        *   165 + 23 = 188
        *   165 - 23 = 142
        *   165 * 23 (too high)
        *   165 / 23 (not an integer)

Operations used: -, * (allowed operations).
Result: 69 (target value).

The equation is (84 - 81) * 23 = 69.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities, just to be thorough.

        *   81*23=1863 (1863 / 69 = 27. So if Y=27, this could work. But Y must be 84. 1863/84 is not 69)

The user wants an equation using the numbers 65, 75, 67, and 32 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target value of 86.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 65, 75, 67, 32.
Target: 86.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with larger numbers and try to reduce them or combine them to get closer to the target.
2. Try to create intermediate values that, when combined with the remaining numbers, yield 86.
3. Consider division carefully, as it can quickly change the magnitude of numbers.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(75 + 65) = 140. Remaining: 67, 32. 140 - 67 = 73. 73 + 32 = 105 (too high). 140 - 32 = 108. 108 - 67 = 41 (too low).
(75 - 65) = 10. Remaining: 67, 32. 10 + 67 = 77. 77 + 32 = 109 (too high). 10 + 32 = 42. 42 + 67 = 109 (too high).
(75 * 65) - too large.
(75 / 65) - not an integer.

Attempt 2:
(67 + 32) = 99. Remaining: 65, 75. 99 - 65 = 34. 34 + 75 = 109 (too high). 99 - 75 = 24. 24 + 65 = 89 (close!).
Let's re-evaluate 99 - 75 = 24. 24 + 65 = 89. This is very close. Can I adjust it?
Maybe (67 + 32) - 75 + 65 = 89.
What if I swap the order of addition/subtraction?
(67 + 32) + 65 - 75 = 89.
(67 + 32) - (75 - 65) = 99 - 10 = 89.

Let's try another combination with 67 and 32.
(67 - 32) = 35. Remaining: 65, 75. 35 + 65 = 100. 100 - 75 = 25 (too low). 35 + 75 = 110. 110 - 65 = 45 (too low).
(67 * 32) - too large.
(67 / 32) - not integer.

Attempt 3:
Let's try combining 65 and 75 first.
(75 - 65) = 10. Remaining: 67, 32.
We need to get 86 from 10, 67, 32.
10 + 67 + 32 = 109.
10 + 67 - 32 = 45.
10 + 32 - 67 = -25.
10 - 67 + 32 = -25.
10 - 32 + 67 = 45.
10 * 67 = 670.
10 * 32 = 320.

Let's try combining 65 and 32.
(65 - 32) = 33. Remaining: 75, 67.
We need to get 86 from 33, 75, 67.
33 + 75 = 108. 108 - 67 = 41.
33 + 67 = 100. 100 - 75 = 25.
33 - 75 = -42. -42 + 67 = 25.
33 - 67 = -34. -34 + 75 = 41.

Let's try combining 75 and 32.
(75 - 32) = 43. Remaining: 65, 67.
We need to get 86 from 43, 65, 67.
43 + 65 = 108. 108 - 67 = 41.
43 + 67 = 110. 110 - 65 = 45.
43 - 65 = -22. -22 + 67 = 45.
43 - 67 = -24. -24 + 65 = 41.

Let's try multiplication.
(65 * ?)
(75 * ?)
(67 * ?)
(32 * ?)

Consider (65 + 75) = 140. Remaining: 67, 32.
140 - 67 = 73. Need 86 from 73 and 32. 73 + 32 = 105. 73 - 32 = 41.
140 - 32 = 108. Need 86 from 108 and 67. 108 - 67 = 41.

Consider (67 + 75) = 142. Remaining: 65, 32.
142 - 65 = 77. Need 86 from 77 and 32. 77 + 32 = 109. 77 - 32 = 45.
142 - 32 = 110. Need 86 from 110 and 65. 110 - 65 = 45.

Consider (65 + 32) = 97. Remaining: 75, 67.
97 - 75 = 22. Need 86 from 22 and 67. 22 + 67 = 89. (Close again!)
97 - 67 = 30. Need 86 from 30 and 75. 30 + 75 = 105.

Let's revisit 97 - 67 = 30. We need 86 from 30 and 75.
If we have 30, and the remaining numbers are 75, we need to get 86.
This means we need to add 56 to 30, or subtract 19 from 75.

Let's try multiplication with one of the numbers.
If we use 32 * something.
32 * 3 = 96. Can we get 3 from the other numbers? (65, 75, 67). No easy way.
32 * 2 = 64. Can we get 2 from the other numbers? (65, 75, 67). No easy way.

Let's try division.
Maybe (75 / 3) = 25. Can we get 3 from (65, 67, 32)? No.
Maybe (65 / ?)
Maybe (75 / ?)
Maybe (67 / ?)
Maybe (32 / ?)

Let's try to construct 86.
86 = 100 - 14. Can we make 100 and 14?
100 = 65 + 35. Can we make 35 from (75, 67, 32)? 75 - 32 - 67 = -24. 67 - 32 = 35. Yes!
So, we have 65 + (67 - 32) = 65 + 35 = 100.
The remaining number is 75.
So, we have 100 and 75. We need to get 86.
100 - 75 = 25. Not 86.

Let's try another way to make 100.
100 = 75 + 25. Can we make 25 from (65, 67, 32)? 65 - 32 - 67 = -34.",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
2886,1732,"<think>The problem asks me to find an equation using the numbers 15, 89, and 21, and the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 53. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let the numbers be $n_1 = 15$, $n_2 = 89$, and $n_3 = 21$. The target is 53.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. Since there are three numbers, there will be two operations. The order of operations matters, so I need to consider parentheses as well.

Let's list the possible structures of the equation:
1. $(n_1 \text{ op1 } n_2) \text{ op2 } n_3$
2. $n_1 \text{ op1 } (n_2 \text{ op2 } n_3)$

Let's try to explore combinations systematically.

**Attempt 1: Start with multiplication or division as they tend to change the magnitude significantly.**

Consider the largest number, 89.
What if 89 is involved in a multiplication?
*   $89 * 15$ is too large.
*   $89 * 21$ is too large.
*   $15 * 21$ is $315$. Then I need to combine 315 with 89 to get 53.
    *   $315 + 89 = 404$ (too large)
    *   $315 - 89 = 226$ (too large)
    *   $89 - 315$ (negative, not 53)
    *   $315 / 89$ (not an integer, unlikely to lead to 53 easily)
    *   $89 / 315$ (fraction)

What if 89 is involved in a division?
*   $89 / 15$ (fraction)
*   $89 / 21$ (fraction)
*   $15 / 89$ (fraction)
*   $21 / 89$ (fraction)
*   $15 / 21$ (fraction)
*   $21 / 15$ (fraction)

It seems direct multiplication or division of the given numbers might not be the primary step if we want to keep the numbers manageable.

**Attempt 2: Focus on getting closer to 53.**

Let's try combining two numbers first and see if the third can adjust it.

*   **Consider 89 and 15:**
    *   $89 + 15 = 104$. Need to get from 104 to 53 using 21.
        *   $104 - 21 = 83$ (not 53)
        *   $104 + 21 = 125$ (not 53)
        *   $104 * 21$ (too large)
        *   $104 / 21$ (fraction)
    *   $89 - 15 = 74$. Need to get from 74 to 53 using 21.
        *   $74 - 21 = 53$. This works!
        The equation is $(89 - 15) - 21 = 53$.
        Let's check: $89 - 15 = 74$. $74 - 21 = 53$.
        Numbers used: 89, 15, 21. All used once.
        Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
        Result: 53. Correct.

This seems like a valid solution. Let me double-check if there are other possibilities or if I missed anything. The problem asks for *an* equation, so finding one is sufficient. However, as a puzzle solver, I like to explore.

Let's try other combinations just to be thorough.

*   **Consider 89 and 21:**
    *   $89 + 21 = 110$. Need to get from 110 to 53 using 15.
        *   $110 - 15 = 95$ (not 53)
        *   $110 + 15 = 125$ (not 53)
        *   $110 / 15$ (fraction)
    *   $89 - 21 = 68$. Need to get from 68 to 53 using 15.
        *   $68 - 15 = 53$. This also works!
        The equation is $(89 - 21) - 15 = 53$.
        Let's check: $89 - 21 = 68$. $68 - 15 = 53$.
        Numbers used: 89, 21, 15. All used once.
        Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
        Result: 53. Correct.

So I have found two valid solutions:
1. $(89 - 15) - 21 = 53$
2. $(89 - 21) - 15 = 53$

Both are correct and satisfy all conditions. I will present the first one I found.

Let's consider the structure $n_1 \text{ op1 } (n_2 \text{ op2 } n_3)$.

*   $15 + (89 - 21) = 15 + 68 = 83$ (not 53)
*   $15 - (89 - 21) = 15 - 68 = -53$ (close, but not 53)
*   $15 * (89 - 21) = 15 * 68$ (too large)
*   $15 / (89 - 21) = 15 / 68$ (fraction)

*   $15 + (89 / 21)$ (fraction)
*   $15 - (89 / 21)$ (fraction)

*   $89 + (15 - 21) = 89 + (-6) = 83$ (not 53)
*   $89 - (15 - 21) = 89 - (-6) = 89 + 6 = 95$ (not 53)
*   $89 * (15 - 21) = 89 * (-6)$ (negative)

*   $21 + (89 - 15) = 21 + 74 = 95$ (not 53)
*   $21 - (89 - 15) = 21 - 74 = -53$ (close, but not 53)

What about division in the second part?
*   $15 + (89 / 21)$ (fraction)
*   $15 - (89 / 21)$ (fraction)
*   $15 * (89 / 21)$ (fraction)
*   $15 / (89 / 21) = 15 * (21 / 89) = 315 / 89$ (fraction)

*   $89 + (15 / 21)$ (fraction)
*   $89 - (15 / 21)$ (fraction)
*   $89 * (15 / 21)$ (fraction)
*   $89 / (15 / 21) = 89 * (21 / 15) = 89 * (7/5) = 623 / 5$ (fraction)

*   $21 + (89 / 15)$ (fraction)
*   $21 - (89 / 15)$ (fraction)
*   $21 * (89 / 15)$ (fraction)
*   $21 / (89 / 15) = 21 * (15 / 89) = 315 / 89$ (fraction)

Let's consider operations that might result in a smaller number from larger ones.
For example, if we subtract a larger number from a smaller one, we get a negative.
If we divide a smaller number by a larger one, we get a fraction.

Let's re-examine the structure $(n_1 \text{ op1 } n_2) \text{ op2 } n_3$.
We found $(89 - 15) - 21 = 53$.

What if the operations were different?

3454,205,"<think>The target number is 94. The available numbers are 49, 71, 24, and 3. I need to combine these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using each number exactly once, to reach 94.

Let's try to get close to 94.
Multiplying the larger numbers might overshoot quickly.
49 * 3 = 147 (too high)
71 * 3 = 213 (too high)
49 * 24 is very large.

Let's try combinations involving subtraction or division to reduce the magnitude.

Consider using the largest number, 71, and adding to it.
71 + ? = 94. This means ? = 23. Can I make 23 from 49, 24, and 3?
49 - 24 - 3 = 25 - 3 = 22 (close)
49 - (24 + 3) = 49 - 27 = 22 (close)
(49 - 24) + 3 = 25 + 3 = 28 (not 23)
(49 + 3) - 24 = 52 - 24 = 28 (not 23)
24 + 3 - 49 = 27 - 49 (negative)
24 * 3 - 49 = 72 - 49 = 23. This works!

So, the expression for 23 is (24 * 3) - 49.
Now, combine this with 71: 71 + ((24 * 3) - 49).
Let's check: 71 + (72 - 49) = 71 + 23 = 94.
This uses all numbers (49, 71, 24, 3) exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's try another approach to confirm.
What if we start with 49?
49 + ? = 94. ? = 45. Can I make 45 from 71, 24, 3?
71 - 24 - 3 = 47 - 3 = 44 (close)
71 - (24 + 3) = 71 - 27 = 44 (close)
(71 - 3) - 24 = 68 - 24 = 44 (close)
(71 + 3) - 24 = 74 - 24 = 50 (not 45)
24 * 3 - 71 = 72 - 71 = 1 (not 45)

What if we start with 24?
24 + ? = 94. ? = 70. Can I make 70 from 49, 71, 3?
71 + 3 - 49 = 74 - 49 = 25 (not 70)
49 + 71 - 3 = 120 - 3 = 117 (too high)

What if we start with 3?
3 + ? = 94. ? = 91. Can I make 91 from 49, 71, 24?
49 + 71 - 24 = 120 - 24 = 96 (close)
71 + 24 - 49 = 95 - 49 = 46 (not 91)

Let's re-evaluate the first successful attempt: 71 + ((24 * 3) - 49).
This looks solid.

Could there be a division involved?
Let's try dividing 49 by 3 (not integer).
Let's try dividing 71 by 3 (not integer).
Let's try dividing 24 by 3 = 8.
Now we have 49, 71, 8. Target 94.
49 + 71 - 8 = 120 - 8 = 112 (too high)
71 + 8 + 49 = 128 (too high)
71 - 8 + 49 = 63 + 49 = 112 (too high)
49 * 8 = 392 (too high)
71 * 8 = 568 (too high)

Let's try dividing 49 by 7 (not available).
Let's try dividing 71 by something (not likely to be integer).
Let's try dividing 24 by 4 (not available).
Let's try dividing 24 by 6 (not available).
Let's try dividing 24 by 8 (not available).
Let's try dividing 24 by 12 (not available).

The first solution seems the most straightforward and correct.
71 + (24 * 3 - 49) = 94.
Numbers used: 71, 24, 3, 49. All used once.
Operations used: +, *, -. All allowed.
Result: 94.

Let's consider order of operations.
71 + (24 * 3 - 49)
Parentheses first:
24 * 3 = 72
72 - 49 = 23
Then addition:
71 + 23 = 94.

This is a valid solution.

11. 90 - (56 + 11) = 90 - 67 = 23 (This works!)
12. 90 - (56 - 11) = 90 - 45 = 45 (Too high)

4516,1508,"<think>The problem asks for a single mathematical equation that evaluates to 73, using the numbers 65, 8, 63, and 62 exactly once, with only the operations +, -, *, and /.

The target number is 73. The given numbers are 65, 8, 63, 62.

Let's list the numbers in ascending order for easier manipulation: 8, 62, 63, 65.

We need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations to get 73.

Let's consider the magnitude of the numbers and the target. 73 is relatively close to some of the given numbers.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to 73 by combining two or three numbers.
3. Look for combinations that might result in a division that simplifies nicely.

Let's try combining pairs of numbers first.

Possible pairs and their results:
65 + 8 = 73. This is the target! But we still have 63 and 62 to use. How can we incorporate them without changing the result of 73?
If we have (65 + 8) and we need to use 63 and 62, we could try to make the remaining part equal to zero.
Can we make 63 and 62 combine to zero? 63 - 62 = 1. 62 - 63 = -1. 63 * 62 is large. 63 / 62 is not an integer.
So, (65 + 8) + (63 - 62) = 73 + 1 = 74. Not 73.
(65 + 8) - (63 - 62) = 73 - 1 = 72. Not 73.
(65 + 8) + (62 - 63) = 73 + (-1) = 72. Not 73.
(65 + 8) - (62 - 63) = 73 - (-1) = 74. Not 73.

This suggests that simply adding or subtracting a combination of the remaining numbers to 73 might not work directly if the remaining combination isn't zero.

Let's try other combinations.

Consider multiplication.
If we multiply two numbers, the result will be larger than 73.
65 * 8 = 520
65 * 63 = 4095
65 * 62 = 4030
8 * 63 = 504
8 * 62 = 496
63 * 62 = 3906

These large numbers will likely need to be divided or subtracted significantly.

Let's try to get close to 73 using multiplication and then adjust.
Maybe a division is involved that results in a small number.

Let's try to form 73 by combining three numbers and then using the fourth.
Example: (65 + 8 + 63) = 136. Then use 62. 136 - 62 = 74. Close.
(65 + 8 - 63) = 10. Then use 62. 10 + 62 = 72. Close. 10 * 62 = 620. 62 / 10 is not integer.
(65 - 8 + 63) = 120. Then use 62. 120 - 62 = 58.
(65 - 8 - 63) = -6. Then use 62. -6 + 62 = 56.

Let's consider division.
Can we create a number that, when divided by one of the given numbers, results in something useful?
Or can we divide two numbers to get a small integer?
63 / ?
62 / ?
8 / ?
65 / ?

Let's try to make a number that is a multiple of 8, 62, 63, or 65.

Consider the target 73.
It's a prime number. This might make division tricky unless the divisor is 1 or the number itself.

Let's try to build up to 73.
We have 65. We need +8. We have 8.
So, 65 + 8 = 73. We still need to use 63 and 62.
How can we combine 63 and 62 to be zero when added or subtracted? We saw that 63-62=1 and 62-63=-1.
What if we multiply 63 and 62 by zero? We can't create zero easily from the remaining numbers.

Let's try a different approach.
What if we use division to reduce a large number?
Suppose we have a large number and divide it by something.

Let's try to combine 63 and 62 first.

If we do (65 + 8) + (something with 63 and 62) = 73. This means (something with 63 and 62) must be 0. We saw this is not possible with simple +/-.

1464,280,"<think>The target number is 39. The available numbers are 64, 67, 48, and 69. I need to use each number exactly once with the four basic arithmetic operations.

Let's try to combine the numbers in different ways.

First, I'll look for combinations that might get me close to 39.
The numbers are relatively large, so division might be useful to reduce them, or subtraction to get smaller numbers.

Let's try some simple combinations:
64 + 67 + 48 + 69 = 248 (too large)
64 * 67 * 48 * 69 (way too large)

Let's try to get a number close to 39 by combining two numbers first.
67 - 64 = 3
69 - 48 = 21
3 + 21 = 24 (not 39)
3 * 21 = 63 (not 39)
21 - 3 = 18 (not 39)
21 / 3 = 7 (not 39)

Let's try another pair:
69 - 67 = 2
64 - 48 = 16
2 + 16 = 18 (not 39)
2 * 16 = 32 (not 39)
16 - 2 = 14 (not 39)
16 / 2 = 8 (not 39)

Let's try another pair:
64 - 48 = 16
69 - 67 = 2
(64 - 48) + (69 - 67) = 16 + 2 = 18

Let's try multiplication and subtraction.
Maybe I can get a number slightly larger than 39 and subtract something.
Or a number slightly smaller and add something.

Let's try dividing one number by another.
64 / 48 is not an integer.
67 / 48 is not an integer.
69 / 48 is not an integer.
64 / 67 is not an integer.
64 / 69 is not an integer.
48 / 64 is not an integer.
48 / 67 is not an integer.
48 / 69 is not an integer.
67 / 64 is not an integer.
67 / 69 is not an integer.
69 / 64 is not an integer.
69 / 67 is not an integer.

This suggests that division might be the last operation, or used on a result of other operations.

Let's try to make a number close to 39 using multiplication.
Maybe 64 and 48 can be combined to make something useful.
64 - 48 = 16.
The remaining numbers are 67 and 69.
Can I get 39 from 16, 67, 69?
16 + 67 + 69 = 152
16 * 67 * 69 (too big)
16 + 67 - 69 = 14
16 + 69 - 67 = 18
67 + 69 - 16 = 120
67 - 69 + 16 = 14
69 - 67 + 16 = 18

Let's try combining 64 and 67.
67 - 64 = 3. Remaining: 48, 69.
Can I get 39 from 3, 48, 69?
3 + 48 + 69 = 120
3 * 48 + 69 = 144 + 69 = 213
3 * 69 + 48 = 207 + 48 = 255
48 + 69 - 3 = 114
69 - 48 + 3 = 24
48 * 3 - 69 = 144 - 69 = 75
69 * 3 - 48 = 207 - 48 = 159
(48 + 69) / 3 = 117 / 3 = 39.
This looks promising!
The expression is (48 + 69) / (67 - 64).
Let's check:
(48 + 69) = 117
(67 - 64) = 3
117 / 3 = 39.
This uses all numbers [64, 67, 48, 69] exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities.
What if I try to get a number close to 39 by multiplying two numbers and then adjusting?
For example, 64 * (something small).
Or 48 * (something small).

Let's try to get 39 by subtracting from a larger number.
Maybe 69 - (something).
69 - 30 = 39. Can I get 30 from 64, 67, 48?
64 - 48 + 67 = 16 + 67 = 83 (no)

64 + 48 - 67 = 112 - 67 = 45 (no)

(67 + 48) / ?

Let's try to get 39 by adding to a smaller number.
Maybe 48 - (something).
48 - 9 = 39. Can I get 9 from 64, 67, 69?
67 - 64 = 3. 69 / 3 = 23 (no)
69 - 67 = 2. 64 / 2 = 32 (no)
69 - 64 = 5. 67 - 5 = 62 (no)

Let's revisit the successful one: (48 + 69) / (67 - 64).
This is a valid solution.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe a large number divided by a small number.
(64 + 67 + 48 + 69) / X = 39 (not likely)

Let's try to make a number that divides nicely.
We found 117 / 3 = 39.
117 can be 48 + 69.
3 can be 67 - 64.

What if we try to make 39 using multiplication and addition/subtraction?
Let's try to get a number close to 39 by multiplying two numbers.
64 * (something)
48 * (something)
67 * (something)
69 * (something)

Let's try to get 39 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the other two.
Example: (64 * X) + Y + Z = 39.
This seems unlikely given the numbers.

Let's consider the structure (A op B) op (C op D).
We found (A + B) / (C - D).

Let's try (A * B) op (C op D).
(64 * 48) ... too big.

Let's try to get a number close to 39 by multiplying one number by a fraction.
For example, 64 * (X/Y).
If X/Y is around 39/64, which is less than 1.
Let's try to make a fraction from the other numbers.
(67-48)/(69-64) = 19/5 (not useful)
(69-48)/(67-64) = 21/3 = 7.
64 * 7 = 448 (too big)

Let's try to get 39 by subtracting a product from a sum.
(64 + 67) - (48 + 69) = 131 - 117 = 14 (no)
(64 + 48) - (67 + 69) = 112 - 136 = -24 (no)

    - So, (36 + 98) - 34 = 134 - 34 = 100.
    - This uses 36, 98, and 34 exactly once. The operations are + and -.
    - So, (36 + 98) - 34 = 100. This is also a valid solution.

- 98 - 36 = 62. Need to get 100 from 62 and 34.
    - 62 + 34 = 96 (close!)
    - 34 - 62 = negative
    - 62 / 34 (not integer)

- 36 - 98 = -62. Need to get 100 from -62 and 34.
    - -62 + 34 = -28
    - 34 - (-62) = 34 + 62 = 96 (close!)

- 36 * 98 = large
- 98 / 36 (not integer)
- 36 / 98 (not integer)

Let's consider division that results in an integer.
Possible divisions:
- 98 / ? (No obvious integer division with 34 or 36)
- 36 / ? (No obvious integer division with 34 or 98)
- 34 / ? (No obvious integer division with 36 or 98)

What if we use division in a way that creates a useful intermediate number?
For example, if we could make 2.
(36-34) = 2. Then 98 + 2 = 100. This was found: (36 - 34) + 98 = 100.

What if we could make 1?
(36/36) = 1. But we only have one 36.

Let's re-examine the solutions found:
1. 98 - (34 - 36) = 100
2. (36 - 34) + 98 = 100
3. (98 - 34) + 36 = 100
4. 36 - (34 - 98) = 100
5. (36 + 98) - 34 = 100

3196,1321,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 10, 78, and 85 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to achieve a result of 70.

Let's list the numbers: {10, 78, 85}.
The target result is 70.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. There are a few possible orders for the numbers and operations.

Let's try some combinations systematically.

Possibility 1: (Number1 Operation1 Number2) Operation2 Number3
Possibility 2: Number1 Operation1 (Number2 Operation2 Number3)

Let's consider the numbers and their approximate magnitudes relative to the target 70.
85 is close to 70.
78 is also close to 70.
10 is smaller.

Let's try starting with the larger numbers and see if we can adjust with 10.

Attempt 1: Start with 85.
If we subtract something from 85 to get 70, that something would be 15. Can we make 15 from 78 and 10?
78 - 10 = 68 (Not 15)
78 + 10 = 88 (Not 15)
78 * 10 = 780 (Not 15)
78 / 10 = 7.8 (Not 15)
10 - 78 = -68 (Not 15)
10 / 78 (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 15 easily)

So, 85 - (something from 78 and 10) = 70 doesn't seem to work directly.

What if we add something to 85? That would make it larger than 70, so we'd need to subtract a larger amount.

Attempt 2: Start with 78.
If we subtract something from 78 to get 70, that something would be 8. Can we make 8 from 85 and 10?
85 - 10 = 75 (Not 8)
85 + 10 = 95 (Not 8)
85 * 10 = 850 (Not 8)
85 / 10 = 8.5 (Close, but not 8)
10 - 85 = -75 (Not 8)
10 / 85 (Not an integer)

So, 78 - (something from 85 and 10) = 70 doesn't seem to work directly.

What if we add something to 78? That would make it larger than 70.

Attempt 3: Combine 85 and 78 first.
85 + 78 = 163. How to get 70 using 10? 163 - 10 = 153. 163 + 10 = 173. 163 * 10 = 1630. 163 / 10 = 16.3. None are 70.
85 - 78 = 7. How to get 70 using 10? 7 + 10 = 17. 7 - 10 = -3. 7 * 10 = 70. This works!
The equation would be (85 - 78) * 10 = 70.
Let's check:
Numbers used: 85, 78, 10. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, *. Allowed.
Result: (7) * 10 = 70. Correct.

Let's verify other combinations just to be thorough.

Attempt 4: Try division.
Can we divide one number by another to get a useful intermediate result?
78 / 10 = 7.8
85 / 10 = 8.5
85 / 78 (not integer)
78 / 85 (not integer)
10 / 78 (not integer)
10 / 85 (not integer)

Let's consider the case where 10 is used in division.
If 10 is the divisor:
(85 + 78) / 10 = 163 / 10 = 16.3
(85 - 78) / 10 = 7 / 10 = 0.7
(78 - 85) / 10 = -7 / 10 = -0.7
(85 * 78) / 10 = 6630 / 10 = 663

If 10 is the dividend:
10 / (85 + 78) = 10 / 163
10 / (85 - 78) = 10 / 7
10 / (78 - 85) = 10 / -7
10 / (85 * 78) = 10 / 6630

None of these seem to lead to 70 easily.

Let's re-examine the successful attempt: (85 - 78) * 10 = 70.
This uses 85, 78, and 10.
The operations are subtraction and multiplication.
The result is 70.
All conditions are met.

Let's consider other orderings of the successful operation.
Could it be 10 * (85 - 78)? Yes, multiplication is commutative. This is the same equation.
Could it be (85 - 78) * 10? Yes, this is what we found.

What about other structures?

The user wants me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers 37, 84, and 40 to reach the target result of 81.
I must use each number exactly once and only the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: [37, 84, 40]
Target: 81

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible combinations of two numbers and an operation:
1. 37 + 84 = 121
2. 37 - 84 = -47
3. 84 - 37 = 47
4. 37 * 84 = 3108
5. 37 / 84 (not an integer, unlikely to be useful unless combined with multiplication later)
6. 84 / 37 (not an integer)
7. 37 + 40 = 77
8. 37 - 40 = -3
9. 40 - 37 = 3
10. 37 * 40 = 1480
11. 37 / 40 (not an integer)
12. 40 / 37 (not an integer)
13. 84 + 40 = 124
14. 84 - 40 = 44
15. 40 - 84 = -44
16. 84 * 40 = 3360
17. 84 / 40 = 2.1 (not an integer)
18. 40 / 84 (not an integer)

Now, let's try combining these intermediate results with the remaining number.

Case 1: Start with 37 and 84.
   - (37 + 84) = 121. Remaining number is 40.
     - 121 + 40 = 161 (No)
     - 121 - 40 = 81 (Yes!)
     - 40 - 121 = -81 (No)
     - 121 * 40 = 4840 (No)
     - 121 / 40 (No)
     - 40 / 121 (No)
     So, (37 + 84) - 40 = 81. This uses all numbers and allowed operations.

Let's verify this solution:
(37 + 84) - 40 = 121 - 40 = 81.
This is a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, though I've already found one.

   - (84 - 37) = 47. Remaining number is 40.
     - 47 + 40 = 87 (No)
     - 47 - 40 = 7 (No)
     - 40 - 47 = -7 (No)
     - 47 * 40 = 1880 (No)
     - 47 / 40 (No)
     - 40 / 47 (No)

Case 2: Start with 37 and 40.
   - (37 + 40) = 77. Remaining number is 84.
     - 77 + 84 = 161 (No)
     - 77 - 84 = -7 (No)
     - 84 - 77 = 7 (No)
     - 77 * 84 = 6468 (No)
     - 77 / 84 (No)
     - 84 / 77 (No)

   - (40 - 37) = 3. Remaining number is 84.
     - 3 + 84 = 87 (No)
     - 3 - 84 = -81 (No)
     - 84 - 3 = 81 (Yes!)
     - 3 * 84 = 252 (No)
     - 3 / 84 (No)
     - 84 / 3 = 28 (No)
     So, (40 - 37) is 3. Then 84 - 3 = 81. This means 84 - (40 - 37) = 81.
     Let's verify: 84 - (40 - 37) = 84 - 3 = 81.
     This is another valid solution.

Case 3: Start with 84 and 40.
   - (84 + 40) = 124. Remaining number is 37.
     - 124 + 37 = 161 (No)
     - 124 - 37 = 87 (No)
     - 37 - 124 = -87 (No)
     - 124 * 37 (No)
     - 124 / 37 (No)
     - 37 / 124 (No)

   - (84 - 40) = 44. Remaining number is 37.
     - 44 + 37 = 81 (Yes!)
     - 44 - 37 = 7 (No)
     - 37 - 44 = -7 (No)
     - 44 * 37 (No)
     - 44 / 37 (No)
     - 37 / 44 (No)
     So, (84 - 40) + 37 = 81.
     Let's verify: (84 - 40) + 37 = 44 + 37 = 81.
     This is a third valid solution.

I have found three valid solutions:
1. (37 + 84) - 40 = 81
2. 84 - (40 - 37) = 81
3. (84 - 40) + 37 = 81

(71 + 6) - 19 = 77 - 19 = 58. No.
(19 - 6) + 71 = 13 + 71 = 84. No.

71 / 19 is not an integer.
71 / 60 is not an integer.
60 / 19 is not an integer.
19 / 10 is not an integer.
71 / 10 is not an integer.
19 / 60 is not an integer.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt.
(71 - 60) + 19 + 10 = 40.
This is a valid solution.

Let's consider other ways to group the addition.
19 + 10 + (71 - 60) = 40. Same equation.
10 + 19 + (71 - 60) = 40. Same equation.

What if I try to get a number close to 40 using two numbers and then adjust with the others?
60 - 19 = 41. Numbers left: 71, 10. Target from 41, 71, 10 to get 40.
41 + 10 - 71 = 51 - 71 = -20. No.
71 - 41 - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20. No.
71 - (41 + 10) = 71 - 51 = 20. No.

60 - 10 = 50. Numbers left: 19, 71. Target from 50, 19, 71 to get 40.
50 + 19 - 71 = 69 - 71 = -2. No.
71 - 50 - 19 = 21 - 19 = 2. No.
71 - (50 + 19) = 71 - 69 = 2. No.

71 - 10 = 61. Numbers left: 19, 60. Target from 61, 19, 60 to get 40.
61 + 19 - 60 = 80 - 60 = 20. No.
60 - 19 + 61 = 41 + 61 = 102. No.
60 + 19 - 61 = 79 - 61 = 18. No.

Let's try multiplication with one of the smaller numbers.
10 * (something).
If I can make something close to 4.
(71 - 60) = 11. 10 * 11 = 110. Left: 19. 110 - 19 = 91. No.
(60 - 19) = 41. 10 * 41 = 410. Left: 71. No.
(71 - 19) = 52. 10 * 52 = 520. Left: 60. No.

What if I use division to get a smaller number to multiply?
60 / 10 = 6. Numbers left: 19, 71. Target from 6, 19, 71 to get 40.
We already checked this and it didn't work.

Let's re-examine the first solution: (71 - 60) + 19 + 10 = 40.
This is clean and uses all numbers and operations correctly.

Could there be another solution?
Let's try to get 40 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others.
10 * 19 = 190. Need to subtract 150 using 60 and 71. 71 + 60 = 131. 71 - 60 = 11. 60 - 71 = -11. No.
10 * 60 = 600. Need to subtract 560 using 19 and 71. No.
10 * 71 = 710. Need to subtract 670 using 19 and 60. No.
19 * 60 = 1140. Need to subtract 1100 using 10 and 71. No.
19 * 71 = 1349. Need to subtract 1309 using 10 and 60. No.
60 * 71 = 4260. Need to subtract 4220 using 10 and 19. No.

What about division as the last step?
(Something) / (Something) = 40.
This would require one of the numbers to be a multiple of 40, or a combination that results in a multiple of 40.
None of the given numbers are multiples of 40.
Let's try to create a multiple of 40.
10 * (something). If something is 4, then 10 * 4 = 40.
Can we make 4 from 19, 71, 60?
71 - 60 - 19 = 11 - 19 = -8. No.
60 - 19 - 71 = 41 - 71 = -30. No.

Let's try to make 80 and divide by 2.
Can we make 80 from 19, 71, 60, 10?
71 + 19 - 10 = 80. Numbers left: 60. So, (71 + 19 - 10) / 60 = 80 / 60. Not 40.

The problem asks me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers 19, 23, and 72, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 68. Each number must be used exactly once.

I need to explore different combinations of numbers and operations. The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) will be important.

Let's list the numbers: 19, 23, 72.
Target: 68.

Possible structures for the expression:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combining the numbers in different orders and with different operations.

**Attempt 1: Start with multiplication, as 72 is the largest number.**

*   72 * 19 ... this will be too large. 72 * 19 = 1368. Then I'd need to subtract a lot using 23. 1368 - 23 = 1345. Not 68.
*   72 * 23 ... even larger.
*   19 * 23 = 437. Then use 72. 437 - 72 = 365. Not 68. 437 + 72 = 509. Not 68.

Multiplication of two numbers seems to lead to results far from 68, unless division is involved early.

**Attempt 2: Consider division.**

*   Can any number be divided by another to get a useful integer?
    *   72 / 19 - not an integer.
    *   72 / 23 - not an integer.
    *   19 / 72 - not an integer.
    *   19 / 23 - not an integer.
    *   23 / 72 - not an integer.
    *   23 / 19 - not an integer.

This means division, if used, will likely result in a non-integer intermediate value, or it must be the last operation, or it must be part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer. Given the target is an integer, and the inputs are integers, it's more likely that division will result in an integer or be part of a structure that cancels out fractions.

Let's re-evaluate division. If division is used, it's likely to be 72 divided by something, or something divided by 19 or 23.

*   What if 72 is divided by a combination of 19 and 23?
    *   72 / (19 + 23) = 72 / 42 - not integer.
    *   72 / (23 - 19) = 72 / 4 = 18. Now I have 18 and the remaining number is 19. Can I get 68 from 18 and 19? 18 + 19 = 37. 19 - 18 = 1. 18 * 19 = 342. 19 / 18 - not integer. This path doesn't work.
    *   72 / (19 * 23) - too small.

*   What if 19 or 23 is divided by something?
    *   (19 + 72) / 23 = 91 / 23 - not integer.
    *   (72 - 19) / 23 = 53 / 23 - not integer.
    *   (19 * 72) / 23 - not integer.

It seems direct division of one number by another or a simple sum/difference of two numbers is not yielding integers.

**Attempt 3: Focus on getting close to 68.**

*   72 is close to 68. I need to subtract 4. Can I make 4 from 19 and 23?
    *   23 - 19 = 4.
    *   So, 72 - (23 - 19) = 72 - 4 = 68.
    *   This uses 72, 23, and 19 exactly once.
    *   The operations are subtraction and subtraction.
    *   Let's check the order of operations: 72 - (23 - 19). Parentheses first: 23 - 19 = 4. Then 72 - 4 = 68.
    *   This looks like a valid solution.

Let's double-check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough.

**Attempt 4: Try addition as the last step.**

*   We need two numbers that add up to 68.
    *   Could one number be 72? Then the other would need to be -4. Can I make -4 from 19 and 23? 19 - 23 = -4. So, 72 + (19 - 23) = 72 + (-4) = 68. This is the same solution as above, just written differently.
    *   Could one number be 19? Then the other would need to be 49. Can I make 49 from 23 and 72? 72 - 23 = 49. So, 19 + (72 - 23) = 19 + 49 = 68. This is another valid solution.
    *   Could one number be 23? Then the other would need to be 45. Can I make 45 from 19 and 72? 72 - 19 = 53. 19 + 72 = 91. No easy way to make 45.

**Attempt 5: Try subtraction as the last step (a - b = 68).**

*   If a = 72, then b = 4. Can I make 4 from 19 and 23? Yes, 23 - 19 = 4. So, 72 - (23 - 19) = 68. (Already found)
*   If a = 19, then b = 19 - 68 = -49. Can I make -49 from 23 and 72? 23 - 72 = -49. So, 19 - (23 - 72) = 19 - (-49) = 19 + 49 = 68. This is equivalent to 19 + (72 - 23) = 68. (Already found)
*   If a = 23, then b = 23 - 68 = -45. Can I make -45 from 19 and 72? No obvious way.

**Attempt 6: Try multiplication as the last step (a * b = 68).**

*   Factors of 68 are (1, 68), (2, 34), (4, 17).
    *   Can I make 4 and 17 from {19, 23, 72}?
        *   Make 4: 23 - 19 = 4. Remaining is 72. Can I make 17 from 72? No.
        *   Make 17: 19 - ? No. 23 - ? No. 72 / ? No.
    *   Can I make 2 and 34?
        *   Make 2: No easy way.
        *   Make 34: No easy way.

**Attempt 7: Try division as the last step (a / b = 68).**

*   This would mean a = 68 * b.
    *   If b = 1, a = 68. Can I make 1 from {19, 23, 72}? No. Can I make 68 from {19, 23, 72}? Yes, 72 - (23 - 19) = 68. But then I'd need to divide 68 by 1, and I've used all numbers. This structure doesn't work.
    *   If b = 2, a = 136. Can I make 2 from {19, 23, 72}? No. Can I make 136 from {19, 23, 72}? No.

Let's revisit the two solutions found:
1.  72 - (23 - 19) = 68
2.  19 + (72 - 23) = 68

Both are valid. The problem asks for *a* valid arithmetic expression. I will present one of them. The first one seems slightly more direct in its construction.

The target number is 90.
The available numbers are [72, 8, 64, 17].
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try to combine the numbers.
We need to get close to 90.
72 is the largest number.
If we add 17 to 72, we get 89. That's very close.
72 + 17 = 89.
We still have 8 and 64 left.
We need to use 8 and 64 to adjust 89 to 90.
This means we need to add 1.
Can we get 1 from 8 and 64 using +, -, *, /?
64 / 8 = 8. Not 1.
8 / 64 = 1/8. Not 1.
64 + 8 = 72. Not 1.
64 - 8 = 56. Not 1.
8 - 64 = -56. Not 1.
8 * 64 = 512. Not 1.

So, 72 + 17 is not the right starting point if we want to add the result of the other two numbers.

Let's try other combinations.
Maybe multiplication is involved to get a larger number and then subtract.
Or maybe division is used to reduce a large number.

Let's consider the numbers again: [72, 8, 64, 17]. Target: 90.

What if we use 64 and 8 first?
64 + 8 = 72. Remaining: [72, 17]. Target: 90.
Can we get 90 from 72, 72, 17? No, we must use the original numbers.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 90 and subtract.
Or a number slightly smaller and add.

Consider 72 and 8.
72 + 8 = 80. Remaining: [64, 17]. Target: 90.
We need to get 10 from 64 and 17.
64 + 17 = 81.
64 - 17 = 47.
17 - 64 = -47.
64 * 17 = 1088.
64 / 17 is not an integer.
17 / 64 is not an integer.
So, 72 + 8 is not the right start.

Consider 72 and 64.
72 + 64 = 136. Remaining: [8, 17]. Target: 90.
We need to get -46 from 8 and 17.
8 + 17 = 25.
17 - 8 = 9.
8 - 17 = -9.
8 * 17 = 136.
8 / 17.
17 / 8.
None of these give -46.

Consider 72 and 17.
72 + 17 = 89. Remaining: [8, 64]. Target: 90.
We need to get 1 from 8 and 64.
As checked before, this is not possible.

Consider 72 - 8 = 64. Remaining: [64, 17]. Target: 90.
We need to get 26 from 64 and 17.
64 + 17 = 81.
64 - 17 = 47.
17 - 64 = -47.
64 * 17 = 1088.
64 / 17.
17 / 64.
None of these give 26.

Consider 72 / 8 = 9. Remaining: [64, 17]. Target: 90.
We need to get 81 from 64 and 17.
64 + 17 = 81.
This works!
So the equation is (72 / 8) + 64 + 17 = 9 + 64 + 17 = 73 + 17 = 90.
Let's check if all numbers are used exactly once: 72, 8, 64, 17. Yes.
Let's check the operations: /, +, +. Yes.

Let's try another possibility just to be sure.
What if we use 64 and 17 first?
64 + 17 = 81. Remaining: [72, 8]. Target: 90.
We need to get 9 from 72 and 8.
72 / 8 = 9.
So, (64 + 17) + (72 / 8) = 81 + 9 = 90.
This also works.
Numbers used: 64, 17, 72, 8. Exactly once.
Operations: +, +, /.

Let's try another one.
What if we use 64 - 17 = 47. Remaining: [72, 8]. Target: 90.
We need to get 43 from 72 and 8.
72 + 8 = 80.
72 - 8 = 64.
72 * 8 = 576.
72 / 8 = 9.
None of these give 43.

Let's try 64 * 17. This is too large.

Let's go back to the first successful one: (72 / 8) + 64 + 17 = 90.
This is a valid solution.

Let's check the second successful one: (64 + 17) + (72 / 8) = 90.
This is also a valid solution.

The problem asks for ""your final, successful equation"". I can present either.
The first one seems slightly simpler in terms of order of operations if written linearly.
72 / 8 + 64 + 17

Let's try to see if there are any other structures.
Maybe subtraction is at the end.
Let's try to get a number larger than 90.
72 + 8 + 17 = 97. Remaining: [64]. Target: 90.
We need to subtract 7 from 64. Not possible.

72 + 64 = 136. Remaining: [8, 17]. Target: 90.
We need to subtract 46.
8 + 17 = 25.
17 - 8 = 9.
8 - 17 = -9.
8 * 17 = 136.
None give 46.

Let's try multiplication with one of the smaller numbers.
8 * 17 = 136. Remaining: [72, 64]. Target: 90.
We need to subtract 46.
72 - 64 = 8.
64 - 72 = -8.

None give 46.

Let's try 8 * 64 = 512. Too large.
Let's try 17 * 64. Too large.
Let's try 17 * 8 = 136.

Let's consider the structure (A * B) + C + D or (A * B) - C - D etc.
Let's try to get a number close to 90 using multiplication of two numbers.
8 * 17 = 136.
8 * 64 = 512.
8 * 72 = 576.
17 * 64 = 1088.
17 * 72 = 1224.
64 * 72 = 4608.
None of these are close to 90.

What about division?
72 / 8 = 9. Remaining: [64, 17]. Target: 90.
9 + 64 + 17 = 90. This is the first solution.

64 / 8 = 8. Remaining: [72, 17]. Target: 90.
8 + 72 + 17 = 97. Not 90.

The problem asks me to construct an equation using the numbers 59, 41, and 66 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 34.

I need to explore different combinations of these three numbers and the four basic operations. Since there are only three numbers, the structure of the equation will likely involve two operations. The possible structures are:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's list the numbers: 59, 41, 66.
The target is 34.

Let's try different pairings and operations.

**Strategy 1: Start with the largest number (66) and try to reduce it.**

*   **Attempt 1:** 66 - ? = 34. This means ? must be 66 - 34 = 32. Can I get 32 from 59 and 41 using one operation?
    *   59 + 41 = 100 (No)
    *   59 - 41 = 18 (No)
    *   41 - 59 = -18 (No)
    *   59 * 41 = 2419 (No)
    *   59 / 41 (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 32 easily)
    *   41 / 59 (Not an integer)
    So, 66 - (something from 59 and 41) doesn't seem to work directly.

*   **Attempt 2:** What if 66 is part of a larger calculation?
    *   Let's try combining 59 and 41 first.
        *   59 + 41 = 100. Can I get 34 from 100 and 66?
            *   100 - 66 = 34. This works!
            The numbers used are 59, 41, and 66. The operations are + and -.
            The equation is (59 + 41) - 66 = 100 - 66 = 34.
            This looks like a valid solution. Let's double-check the constraints:
            - Numbers used: 59, 41, 66 (exactly once). Yes.
            - Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic). Yes.
            - Result: 34. Yes.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough and ensure this is the most straightforward or to see if there are alternatives.

**Strategy 2: Try multiplication or division early on.**

*   **Attempt 3:** What if 59 is involved in multiplication?
    *   59 * 41 = 2419. How to get 34 from 2419 and 66? Unlikely.
    *   59 * 66 = 3894. How to get 34 from 3894 and 41? Unlikely.

*   **Attempt 4:** What if 41 is involved in multiplication?
    *   41 * 59 (already done)
    *   41 * 66 = 2706. How to get 34 from 2706 and 59? Unlikely.

*   **Attempt 5:** What if 66 is involved in multiplication?
    *   66 * 59 (already done)
    *   66 * 41 (already done)

*   **Attempt 6:** What if division is involved?
    *   59 / 41 (not integer)
    *   59 / 66 (not integer)
    *   41 / 59 (not integer)
    *   41 / 66 (not integer)
    *   66 / 59 (not integer)
    *   66 / 41 (not integer)
    Division is unlikely to be the primary operation unless it results in a small integer that can then be used. For example, if we had 100 / 2 = 50, then we could use 50 with other numbers. But here, none of the divisions result in simple integers.

Let's reconsider the structure (a op1 b) op2 c and a op1 (b op2 c).

We found (59 + 41) - 66 = 34. This fits the (a op1 b) op2 c structure.

Let's try other combinations for (a op1 b) op2 c:
*   (59 - 41) + 66 = 18 + 66 = 84 (No)
*   (59 - 41) - 66 = 18 - 66 = -48 (No)
*   (41 - 59) + 66 = -18 + 66 = 48 (No)
*   (41 - 59) - 66 = -18 - 66 = -84 (No)
*   (59 + 66) - 41 = 125 - 41 = 84 (No)
*   (59 - 66) + 41 = -7 + 41 = 34. This also works!
    The equation is (59 - 66) + 41 = -7 + 41 = 34.
    Numbers used: 59, 66, 41 (exactly once). Yes.
    Operations used: -, + (basic arithmetic). Yes.
    Result: 34. Yes.
    This is another valid solution.

*   (66 - 59) + 41 = 7 + 41 = 48 (No)
*   (66 - 59) - 41 = 7 - 41 = -34 (No)
*   (41 + 66) - 59 = 107 - 59 = 48 (No)
*   (41 - 66) + 59 = -25 + 59 = 34. This also works!
    The equation is (41 - 66) + 59 = -25 + 59 = 34.
    Numbers used: 41, 66, 59 (exactly once). Yes.
    Operations used: -, + (basic arithmetic). Yes.
    Result: 34. Yes.
    This is a third valid solution.

Let's try the structure a op1 (b op2 c):

5477,1758,"<think>The numbers available are [81, 7, 63] and the target is 11. I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with 81:**
    *   81 + 7 + 63 = 151 (too high)
    *   81 - 7 - 63 = 11. This looks promising! Let's check if it's valid. Yes, it uses all numbers and only subtraction.

Let's verify this:
81 - 7 = 74
74 - 63 = 11

This equation uses all the numbers [81, 7, 63] exactly once and results in the target value 11. The operations used are subtraction.

Are there other possibilities?
*   81 / 7 is not an integer.
*   81 * 7 is too large.
*   81 + 7 = 88. Then 88 - 63 = 25 (not 11).
*   81 - 7 = 74. Then 74 - 63 = 11. (Found this one already)
*   81 * 7 = 567. Then 567 / 63 = 9 (not 11).
*   81 / 63 is not an integer.
*   81 + 63 = 144. Then 144 - 7 = 137 (not 11).
*   81 - 63 = 18. Then 18 - 7 = 11. This is another valid solution.

Let's check the second solution:
81 - 63 = 18
18 - 7 = 11

Both `81 - 7 - 63` and `81 - 63 - 7` work. The order of subtraction doesn't matter for the result, but the equation structure is slightly different. The prompt asks for *a* valid equation. I'll present the first one I found.

Let's consider other starting points just to be thorough, though the first one seems straightforward.

2.  **Start with 7:**
    *   7 + 81 - 63 = 88 - 63 = 25 (not 11)
    *   7 - 81 + 63 = -74 + 63 = -11 (not 11)
    *   7 * 81 = 567. 567 / 63 = 9 (not 11)
    *   7 * 63 = 441. 441 / 81 is not an integer.
    *   7 + 63 = 70. 70 - 81 = -11 (not 11)
    *   7 - 63 = -56. -56 + 81 = 25 (not 11)

3.  **Start with 63:**
    *   63 + 81 - 7 = 144 - 7 = 137 (not 11)
    *   63 - 81 + 7 = -18 + 7 = -11 (not 11)
    *   63 * 7 = 441. 441 / 81 is not an integer.
    *   63 / 7 = 9. Then 9 + 81 = 90 (not 11). 9 - 81 = -72 (not 11). 81 - 9 = 72 (not 11).
    *   63 + 7 = 70. 70 - 81 = -11 (not 11).
    *   63 - 7 = 56. 56 - 81 = -25 (not 11).

The simplest and most direct solution found is `81 - 7 - 63`.
</think><answer>81 - 7 - 63</answer>",1.0,
2444,152,"<think>The problem asks for an equation using the numbers 17, 72, and 38, each exactly once, with only the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a result of 17.

Let the numbers be $a=17$, $b=72$, and $c=38$. We need to find an arrangement and operations such that the result is 17.

Possible combinations of operations and numbers:
1. $(a \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } c = 17$
2. $(a \text{ op1 } c) \text{ op2 } b = 17$
3. $(b \text{ op1 } a) \text{ op2 } c = 17$
4. $(b \text{ op1 } c) \text{ op2 } a = 17$
5. $(c \text{ op1 } a) \text{ op2 } b = 17$
6. $(c \text{ op1 } b) \text{ op2 } a = 17$

Let's try to incorporate the number 17 itself into the equation. Since the target is 17, it's likely that 17 will be involved in a way that either it's the result of a sub-expression or it's added/subtracted at the end.

Consider the case where 17 is the final result of an addition or subtraction.
If the equation is of the form $X + 17 = 17$, then $X$ must be 0. Can we get 0 from 72 and 38 using one operation? $72-38 \neq 0$, $72+38 \neq 0$, $72*38 \neq 0$, $72/38 \neq 0$. So this form is unlikely.
If the equation is of the form $X - 17 = 17$, then $X$ must be 34. Can we get 34 from 72 and 38? $72-38 = 34$. This looks promising!
So, we could have $(72 - 38) - 17 = 34 - 17 = 17$. This uses all numbers and operations correctly.

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 72, 38, 17. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
Result: $72 - 38 = 34$. $34 - 17 = 17$. The result is 17.

Let's explore other possibilities to be sure, though the above seems to be a valid solution.

What if 17 is part of a multiplication or division that results in 17?
If $X * 17 = 17$, then $X=1$. Can we get 1 from 72 and 38? No.
If $X / 17 = 17$, then $X = 17 * 17 = 289$. Can we get 289 from 72 and 38? No.
If $17 / X = 17$, then $X=1$. Can we get 1 from 72 and 38? No.

What if 17 is the result of a sub-expression?
For example, $(72 / b) + c = 17$.
If $b=38$, $72/38$ is not an integer.
If $b=17$, $72/17$ is not an integer.

Let's go back to the successful attempt: $(72 - 38) - 17 = 17$.
This uses the numbers 72, 38, and 17.
It uses the subtraction operation twice.
The result is 17.

Let's consider other arrangements of the numbers and operations.
Could we have $17 + (72 - 38) = 17 + 34 = 51 \neq 17$.
Could we have $17 - (72 - 38) = 17 - 34 = -17 \neq 17$.
Could we have $(72 - 17) - 38 = 55 - 38 = 17$. This also works!
Numbers used: 72, 17, 38. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
Result: $72 - 17 = 55$. $55 - 38 = 17$. The result is 17.

Could we have $(38 - 72) + 17 = -34 + 17 = -17 \neq 17$.
Could we have $(38 - 17) + 72 = 21 + 72 = 93 \neq 17$.
Could we have $72 - (38 - 17) = 72 - 21 = 51 \neq 17$.
Could we have $17 - (38 - 72) = 17 - (-34) = 17 + 34 = 51 \neq 17$.

Let's consider multiplication.
If we multiply 17 by something, it's unlikely to get 17 unless we multiply by 1.
Can we get 1 from 72 and 38? No.

What about division?
If we divide 72 by something, or 38 by something, or 17 by something.
Consider $72 / X = 17$. $X = 72/17$, not integer.
Consider $38 / X = 17$. $X = 38/17$, not integer.
Consider $17 / X = 17$. $X = 1$. Can we get 1 from 72 and 38? No.

Consider $X / 72 = 17$. $X = 17 * 72$, too large.
Consider $X / 38 = 17$. $X = 17 * 38$, too large.
Consider $X / 17 = 17$. $X = 17 * 17 = 289$. Can we get 289 from 72 and 38? No.

Let's re-examine the two solutions found:
1. $(72 - 38) - 17 = 17$
2. $(72 - 17) - 38 = 17$

Both are valid. The problem asks for ""an equation"". I will pick one. The first one is slightly more straightforward in terms of order of operations if parentheses were not explicitly used, but with parentheses, both are clear.

Let's try to see if there are any other structures.
What if 17 is the result of a division?
$(72+38)/X = 17 \implies 110/X = 17 \implies X = 110/17$, not integer.
$(72-38)/X = 17 \implies 34/X = 17 \implies X = 2$. Can we get 2 from 17? No.
$(38-72)/X = 17 \implies -34/X = 17 \implies X = -2$. Can we get -2 from 17? No.

What if 17 is the result of a multiplication?
$(72+38)*X = 17 \implies 110*X = 17 \implies X = 17/110$.
$(72-38)*X = 17 \implies 34*X = 17 \implies X = 17/34 = 1/2$. Can we get 1/2 from 17? No.

The subtraction-based solutions seem to be the most direct.
Let's confirm the requirements:
- Use numbers [17 72 38]: Yes, all used.
- Result is 17: Yes.
- Only use +, -, *, /: Yes.
- Each number used exactly once: Yes.

I will present the first solution found.
Equation: $(72 - 38) - 17 = 17$.
Check: $72 - 38 = 34$. $34 - 17 = 17$. Correct.

Alternative: $(72 - 17) - 38 = 17$.
Check: $72 - 17 = 55$. $55 - 38 = 17$. Correct.

I will choose the first one.

The user wants an equation using the numbers [45, 9, 74, 92] exactly once, combined with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to equal 43.

I need to explore different combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 45, 9, 74, 92.
Target: 43.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try grouping the numbers in different ways and applying operations.

Attempt 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(92 - 74) = 18.
Now I have 18, 45, 9. Target is 43.
18 + 45 = 63. 63 - 9 = 54. Not 43.
18 - 45 = -27. -27 + 9 = -18. Not 43.
18 * 9 = 162. 162 + 45 = 207. Not 43.
18 / 9 = 2. 2 + 45 = 47. Close, but not 43.
2 - 45 = -43. Not 43.

Attempt 2: Try another grouping.
(74 - 45) = 29.
Now I have 29, 9, 92. Target is 43.
29 + 9 = 38. 38 + 92 = 130. Not 43.
29 - 9 = 20. 20 + 92 = 112. Not 43.
29 * 9 = 261. 261 + 92 = 353. Not 43.
29 / 9 is not an integer. Let's avoid non-integers for now unless it seems unavoidable.

Attempt 3: Try multiplication early.
45 * 9 = 405.
Now I have 405, 74, 92. Target is 43.
405 - 74 = 331. 331 - 92 = 239. Not 43.
405 - 92 = 313. 313 - 74 = 239. Not 43.
405 + 74 = 479. 479 - 92 = 387. Not 43.

Attempt 4: Try division.
74 / 9 is not an integer.
92 / 45 is not an integer.
92 / 9 is not an integer.
45 / 9 = 5.
Now I have 5, 74, 92. Target is 43.
5 + 74 = 79. 79 - 92 = -13. Not 43.
5 - 74 = -69. -69 + 92 = 23. Not 43.
5 * 74 = 370. 370 - 92 = 278. Not 43.
5 + 92 = 97. 97 - 74 = 23. Not 43.
5 - 92 = -87. -87 + 74 = -13. Not 43.
5 * 92 = 460. 460 - 74 = 386. Not 43.

Let's try combining numbers differently.
Maybe the 9 is used to divide a larger number.
(74 + 92) = 166. 166 / 9 is not integer.
(92 - 74) = 18. 18 / 9 = 2. We saw this in Attempt 1. (45/9) = 5. (92-74)/9 = 2. 5, 2, 45. No, 5, 2, 45 is wrong. The numbers are 45, 9, 74, 92.
If I use 45/9 = 5, then I have 5, 74, 92. Target 43.
5 + 74 - 92 = -13.
5 - 74 + 92 = 23.
5 + 92 - 74 = 23.
74 + 5 - 92 = -13.
74 - 5 + 92 = 161.
92 + 5 - 74 = 23.
92 - 5 + 74 = 161.

Let's try using 9 to subtract from something.
(74 - 9) = 65.
Now I have 65, 45, 92. Target 43.
65 - 45 = 20. 20 + 92 = 112.
65 + 45 = 110. 110 - 92 = 18.
65 - 92 = -27. -27 + 45 = 18.

Let's try using 9 to add to something.
(74 + 9) = 83.
Now I have 83, 45, 92. Target 43.
83 - 45 = 38. 38 + 92 = 130.
83 + 45 = 128. 128 - 92 = 36.
83 - 92 = -9. -9 + 45 = 36.

Let's try using 92 to subtract from something.
(74 - 92) = -18.
Now I have -18, 45, 9. Target 43.
-18 + 45 = 27. 27 + 9 = 36.
-18 - 45 = -63. -63 + 9 = -54.
-18 + 9 = -9. -9 + 45 = 36.

Let's try using 92 to add to something.
(74 + 92) = 166.
Now I have 166, 45, 9. Target 43.
166 - 45 = 121. 121 - 9 = 112.
166 - 9 = 157. 157 - 45 = 112.
166 - (45 + 9) = 166 - 54 = 112.

Let's consider the target 43. It's a relatively small number. This suggests that large numbers might be subtracted or divided.

Let's try to get close to 43 with two numbers and then adjust with the other two.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 50, 84, 45, and 47, with the operations +, -, *, /, that evaluates to 32. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try different combinations.

Target: 32

Numbers: [50, 84, 45, 47]

Possible approaches:
1. Start with a large number and subtract/divide.
2. Combine smaller numbers to get a value that can be used with the larger numbers.

Let's try combining 45 and 47 first.
45 + 47 = 92
47 - 45 = 2
45 * 47 = 2115
47 / 45 (not an integer)

Let's try combining 50 and 84.
84 - 50 = 34. Close to 32.
If we have 34, we need to get -2 from 45 and 47.
45 - 47 = -2.
So, (84 - 50) + (45 - 47) = 34 + (-2) = 32.
This uses all numbers: 84, 50, 45, 47.
Operations used: -, +, -.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's double-check:
(84 - 50) + (45 - 47)
= 34 + (-2)
= 32

This works.

Let's try another combination just to be sure.
Maybe start with 50.
50 - ? = 32. Need 18.
Can we get 18 from 84, 45, 47?
84 - 47 - 45 = 84 - 92 = -8 (No)
84 / 47 (No)
84 / 45 (No)
47 - 45 = 2. 84 / 2 = 42. 50 - 42 = 8 (No)
47 + 45 = 92. 84 - 92 = -8. 50 - (-8) = 58 (No)

Let's try starting with 84.
84 - ? = 32. Need 52.
Can we get 52 from 50, 45, 47?
50 + 47 - 45 = 97 - 45 = 52.
So, 84 - (50 + 47 - 45) = 84 - (97 - 45) = 84 - 52 = 32.
This uses all numbers: 84, 50, 47, 45.
Operations used: -, +, -.
This is also a valid solution.

Let's double-check:
84 - (50 + 47 - 45)
= 84 - (97 - 45)
= 84 - 52
= 32

Both (84 - 50) + (45 - 47) and 84 - (50 + 47 - 45) are valid. I will provide the first one as it's slightly simpler.

Equation: (84 - 50) + (45 - 47)
Numbers used: 84, 50, 45, 47 (all used exactly once)
Operations used: -, +, -
Evaluation:
84 - 50 = 34
45 - 47 = -2
34 + (-2) = 32

The equation is correct.

5553,905,"<think>The target number is 95. The available numbers are 15, 39, and 41. I need to use each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's try combinations:

1.  **Addition/Subtraction focused:**
    *   15 + 39 + 41 = 95. This is the simplest. Let's check if it's valid. Yes, it uses all numbers once and basic addition.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or if the simplest wasn't allowed (though it is).

2.  **Multiplication involved:**
    *   Could 15 * something be close to 95? 15 * 6 = 90. Can I make 6 from 39 and 41? No, not easily with one operation.
    *   Could 39 * something be close to 95? 39 * 2 = 78. Can I make 2 from 15 and 41? No.
    *   Could 41 * something be close to 95? 41 * 2 = 82. Can I make 2 from 15 and 39? No.

3.  **Division involved:**
    *   Can I divide any of these numbers to get a useful integer?
        *   39 / 15 is not an integer.
        *   41 / 15 is not an integer.
        *   41 / 39 is not an integer.
        *   15 / 39 is not an integer.
        *   15 / 41 is not an integer.
        *   39 / 41 is not an integer.
    *   This suggests division might not be the primary operation leading to an integer result unless it's part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's re-evaluate the addition.
15 + 39 + 41 = 95.
This is a valid equation using all numbers exactly once with basic operations.

Let's consider if there are other ways.
What if we try to get a number close to 95 and then adjust?
*   41 * 3 = 123. Can I subtract something made from 15 and 39 to get 95? 123 - 95 = 28. Can I make 28 from 15 and 39? 39 - 15 = 24. No.
*   41 * 2 = 82. Can I add something made from 15 and 39 to get 95? 95 - 82 = 13. Can I make 13 from 15 and 39? No.
*   39 * 3 = 117. 117 - 95 = 22. Can I make 22 from 15 and 41? No.
*   39 * 2 = 78. 95 - 78 = 17. Can I make 17 from 15 and 41? No.
*   15 * 7 = 105. 105 - 95 = 10. Can I make 10 from 39 and 41? No.
*   15 * 6 = 90. 95 - 90 = 5. Can I make 5 from 39 and 41? No.

The simplest solution 15 + 39 + 41 = 95 is the most straightforward and valid.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 21, 9, and 88 to equal 100.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combinations:
1. (21 + 9) * ?  -> 30 * ?  Doesn't seem to work with 88.
2. (21 - 9) * ?  -> 12 * ?  Doesn't seem to work with 88.
3. (21 * 9) + ?  -> 189 + ?  Doesn't seem to work with 88.
4. (21 / 9) * ?  -> Not an integer, unlikely.

Let's try starting with 88.
1. 88 + ?
   88 + 21 + 9 = 118 (too high)
   88 + 21 - 9 = 100 (This works!)
   88 + 9 - 21 = 76 (too low)
   88 - 21 + 9 = 76 (too low)
   88 - 9 + 21 = 100 (This also works!)

Let's check the second option: 88 - 9 + 21 = 100.
Numbers used: 88, 9, 21. All used once.
Operations used: subtraction, addition. Allowed.
Result: 100. Correct.

Let's check the first option: 88 + 21 - 9 = 100.

864,213,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 25, 77, 7, and 40 exactly once, with the operations +, -, *, /, to arrive at the result 84.

I need to try different combinations of operations and number placements.

Let's list the numbers: 25, 77, 7, 40. Target: 84.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust.
2. Try to create numbers close to 84 or multiples/factors of numbers that can lead to 84.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(77 + 25) - (40 - 7) = 102 - 33 = 69 (Too low)
(77 - 25) + (40 + 7) = 52 + 47 = 99 (Too high)
(77 * 7) ... this will be too large. 77 * 7 = 539.

Attempt 2:
Let's try division.
Maybe divide 77 by 7? 77 / 7 = 11.
Now I have 11, 25, 40. Target 84.
11 + 25 + 40 = 76 (Too low)
(25 * 40) / 11 ... not an integer.
(25 + 40) + 11 = 65 + 11 = 76 (Too low)
(25 * 4) ... not using 40.
(25 * 11) ... not using 40.
(40 * 11) ... not using 25.

Let's try another division.
Maybe 40 / ? Not useful.
Maybe 25 / ? Not useful.

Attempt 3:
Let's try multiplication with smaller numbers first.
7 * 25 = 175. Now I have 175, 77, 40. Target 84.
175 - 77 - 40 = 98 - 40 = 58 (Too low)
175 - (77 + 40) = 175 - 117 = 58 (Too low)

Attempt 4:
Let's try multiplication with 7 and 40.
7 * 40 = 280. Now I have 280, 25, 77. Target 84.
280 - 77 - 25 = 203 - 25 = 178 (Too high)
280 - (77 + 25) = 280 - 102 = 178 (Too high)

Attempt 5:
Let's try multiplication with 25 and 40.
25 * 40 = 1000. Now I have 1000, 77, 7. Target 84.
1000 / 7 ... not integer.
1000 - 77 - 7 = 923 - 7 = 916 (Too high)

Attempt 6:
Let's try to get a number close to 84 by adding/subtracting first.
77 + 7 = 84. Now I have 84, 25, 40. Target 84.
This means I need to use 25 and 40 in a way that results in 0.
(25 - 40) ... not 0.
(40 - 25) ... not 0.
(25 / 40) ... not 0.
(40 / 25) ... not 0.
(25 * 40) ... not 0.

This suggests that 77 + 7 = 84 is not the direct path.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with another, gets close to 84.
Consider 40.
40 * 2 = 80. I don't have 2.

The user wants me to create a mathematical equation using the numbers 23, 6, 8, and 73.
The equation must evaluate to 82.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combining the numbers.
The target is 82.
The numbers are 23, 6, 8, 73.

Possible combinations:
- Start with the largest number, 73.
  - 73 + something = 82. The something needs to be 9.
    Can I make 9 from 23, 6, 8?
    - 23 - 6 - 8 = 23 - 14 = 9. This works!
    So, 73 + (23 - 6 - 8) = 73 + 9 = 82.
    This uses all numbers (73, 23, 6, 8) exactly once.
    The operations are addition and subtraction.

Let's verify:
73 + (23 - 6 - 8)
= 73 + (17 - 8)
= 73 + 9
= 82

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's try other approaches just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.
- What if I multiply?
  - 23 * 6 = 138 (too large)
  - 23 * 8 = 184 (too large)
  - 6 * 8 = 48
    - 48 + 73 = 121 (too large)
    - 48 - 73 (negative)
    - 73 - 48 = 25. Can I make 82 from 25 and 23? 25 + 23 = 48, 25 - 23 = 2, 23 - 25 (negative). No.

- What about division?
  - 73 / 23 (not an integer)
  - 73 / 6 (not an integer)
  - 73 / 8 (not an integer)
  - 23 / 6 (not an integer)
  - 23 / 8 (not an integer)
  - 6 / 8 (fraction)
  - 8 / 6 (fraction)
  - 8 / 23 (fraction)
  - 6 / 23 (fraction)

It seems the addition/subtraction approach is the most straightforward.

The equation is 73 + (23 - 6 - 8) = 82.
I need to present it within <answer></answer> tags.
The numbers used are 73, 23, 6, 8. All used once.
The operations are +, -, -. Allowed.
The result is 82. Correct.

The order of operations matters. Parentheses are allowed implicitly by the structure of the expression.
73 + 23 - 6 - 8 = 96 - 6 - 8 = 90 - 8 = 82.
So, parentheses are not strictly necessary if written in this order, but they clarify the thought process.
The user asked for ""a mathematical equation"".
73 + 23 - 6 - 8 = 82 is a valid equation.

Let's consider other arrangements of the numbers with addition and subtraction.
- 23 + 73 - 8 - 6 = 96 - 8 - 6 = 88 - 6 = 82. This also works.
- 73 - 8 + 23 - 6 = 65 + 23 - 6 = 88 - 6 = 82. This also works.
- 23 - 8 + 73 - 6 = 15 + 73 - 6 = 88 - 6 = 82. This also works.

The first one I found, 73 + (23 - 6 - 8), is clear.
The simplest form without explicit parentheses that works is 73 + 23 - 6 - 8 = 82.
Or 23 + 73 - 8 - 6 = 82.

I will use the one that came to mind first: 73 + 23 - 6 - 8 = 82.
It uses all numbers [23, 6, 8, 73] exactly once.
It uses addition and subtraction.
It evaluates to 82.

Final check of constraints:
- Numbers: [23 6 8 73] - used.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - used + and -.
- Each number used precisely once - yes.
- Evaluates to 82 - yes.
- Final equation within <answer></answer> tags - yes.
- Intermediate calculations within <think></think> tags - yes.
- No other text outside tags - yes.

The equation 73 + 23 - 6 - 8 = 82 is a valid solution.
Another valid solution is 23 + 73 - 8 - 6 = 82.
I'll pick one. 73 + 23 - 6 - 8 = 82.

221,334,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 99, 40, and 29 exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to achieve a target value of 30.

My strategy will be to systematically explore combinations of the numbers and operations. Since there are only three numbers, the number of permutations is limited. I will consider different groupings and orders of operations.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 99, N2 = 40, N3 = 29.
Target = 30.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (N1 op1 N2) op2 N3
2. N1 op1 (N2 op2 N3)

Let's try combinations:

**Attempt 1: Using addition and subtraction.**
*   (99 + 40) - 29 = 139 - 29 = 110 (Too high)
*   (99 - 40) + 29 = 59 + 29 = 88 (Too high)
*   99 + (40 - 29) = 99 + 11 = 110 (Too high)
*   99 - (40 + 29) = 99 - 69 = 30 (This works!)

Let's verify this:
99 - (40 + 29)
First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 40 + 29 = 69.
Then, subtract this result from 99: 99 - 69 = 30.

This equation uses 99, 40, and 29 exactly once, and only uses subtraction and addition. The result is 30.

I should also explore other possibilities to ensure I've considered them, though I've already found a valid solution.

**Attempt 2: Including multiplication.**
*   (99 * 40) + 29 = 3960 + 29 = 3989 (Too high)
*   (99 * 40) - 29 = 3960 - 29 = 3931 (Too high)
*   99 * (40 + 29) = 99 * 69 (Very high)
*   99 * (40 - 29) = 99 * 11 (Very high)
*   (99 + 40) * 29 = 139 * 29 (Very high)
*   (99 - 40) * 29 = 59 * 29 (Very high)

**Attempt 3: Including division.**
Division can often lead to smaller numbers, which might be useful.
*   99 / 40 (Not an integer, likely to complicate things unless it cancels out later)
*   99 / 29 (Not an integer)
*   40 / 29 (Not an integer)
*   40 / 99 (Not an integer)
*   29 / 99 (Not an integer)
*   29 / 40 (Not an integer)

Let's consider cases where division might result in an integer or a useful fraction.
*   (99 + 29) / 40 = 128 / 40 (Not an integer, 3.2)
*   (99 - 29) / 40 = 70 / 40 (Not an integer, 1.75)
*   (40 + 29) / 99 = 69 / 99 (Not an integer)
*   (40 - 29) / 99 = 11 / 99 (Not an integer)
*   (99 + 40) / 29 = 139 / 29 (Not an integer)
*   (99 - 40) / 29 = 59 / 29 (Not an integer)

What if we try to get a number close to 30 using two numbers and then adjust with the third?
*   99 / 3 = 33. Can we get 3 from 40 and 29? 40 - 29 = 11, 40 + 29 = 69, 40 * 29, 40 / 29. No easy way to get 3.
*   40 - 10 = 30. Can we get 10 from 99 and 29? 99 - 29 = 70, 99 + 29 = 128, 99 * 29, 99 / 29. No easy way to get 10.
*   29 + 1 = 30. Can we get 1 from 99 and 40? 99 - 40 = 59, 99 + 40 = 139, 99 * 40, 99 / 40. No easy way to get 1.

Let's re-examine the first successful attempt: 99 - (40 + 29).
This is a valid solution.

Let's consider other permutations of the numbers with the same operations:
*   40 - (99 + 29) = 40 - 128 = -88
*   40 - (29 + 99) = 40 - 128 = -88
*   29 - (99 + 40) = 29 - 139 = -110
*   29 - (40 + 99) = 29 - 139 = -110

*   99 - (29 + 40) = 99 - 69 = 30 (Same as before)
*   40 - (99 - 29) = 40 - 70 = -30
*   40 - (29 - 99) = 40 - (-70) = 110
*   29 - (99 - 40) = 29 - 59 = -30
*   29 - (40 - 99) = 29 - (-59) = 88

*   (99 + 40) - 29 = 139 - 29 = 110
*   (99 - 40) + 29 = 59 + 29 = 88
*   (40 + 99) - 29 = 139 - 29 = 110
*   (40 - 99) + 29 = -59 + 29 = -30
*   (29 + 99) - 40 = 128 - 40 = 88
*   (29 - 99) + 40 = -70 + 40 = -30

The solution 99 - (40 + 29) = 30 is confirmed.
The order of operations is crucial. Parentheses ensure 40 + 29 is calculated first.

Let's consider if there are any other simple combinations.
What if we try to get a number slightly larger than 30 and subtract?
*   40 - 10 = 30. Can we make 10 from 99 and 29? No simple way.
*   29 + 1 = 30. Can we make 1 from 99 and 40? No simple way.

What if we try to get a number slightly smaller than 30 and add?
*   29 + 1 = 30.
*   40 - 10 = 30.

Consider division again.
If we can get 30 from two numbers, and the third number is 1, we can multiply or divide by 1.
*   Can we get 30 from 99 and 40? No.
*   Can we get 30 from 99 and 29? No.
*   Can we get 30 from 40 and 29? No.

What if we use division to create a smaller number that can be used in addition/subtraction?
For example, if we had 60 and 2, we could do 60/2 = 30.
Or if we had 30 and 1, we could do 30*1 = 30.

Let's try to make 30 using two numbers and then use the third number as a multiplier or divisor of 1.

4395,982,"<think>The problem asks to use the numbers [90, 45, 70, 35] exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to obtain the result 97.

Let the numbers be $a=90$, $b=45$, $c=70$, $d=35$. We need to find an expression of the form $f(a, b, c, d) = 97$.

Let's try some combinations.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

We have four numbers. We can combine them in various ways.

Consider the order of operations. Parentheses can be used.

Let's try to get close to 97.
90 is close to 97. We need to add 7.
Can we get 7 from 45, 70, 35?
70 / (45 - 35) = 70 / 10 = 7.
So, 90 + (70 / (45 - 35)) = 90 + 7 = 97.
This uses all numbers [90, 45, 70, 35] exactly once.
The operations used are +, /, -.

Let's verify the calculation:
90 + (70 / (45 - 35))
= 90 + (70 / 10)
= 90 + 7
= 97.

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there are simpler ones.

What if we start with multiplication?
45 * 2 = 90. Can we get 2 from 70 and 35? 70/35 = 2.
So, 45 * (70 / 35) = 45 * 2 = 90.
We still have 90 left. We need to get 97.
90 + 90 = 180. Not 97.

What if we try to get a number slightly larger than 97 and subtract?
Or a number slightly smaller and add?

Let's consider the numbers again: [90, 45, 70, 35].
Notice that 45 is half of 90, and 35 is half of 70.
Also, 70 - 35 = 35.
45 - 35 = 10.
90 - 45 = 45.
90 - 70 = 20.
90 - 35 = 55.
70 - 45 = 25.

Let's try combining pairs first.

(70 + 35) = 105
(70 - 35) = 35
(70 * 35) = 2450
(70 / 35) = 2

Let's use the results from these pairs.

Case 1: (90 / 45) = 2. Remaining numbers are 70, 35.
We need to combine 2, 70, 35 to get 97.
2 + 70 + 35 = 107 (too high)

(90 / 45) = 2. Combine 2, 2. 2+2=4, 2-2=0, 2*2=4, 2/2=1.

Case 3: (45 - 35) = 10. Remaining numbers are 90, 70.
We need to combine 10, 90, 70 to get 97.
10 + 90 + 70 = 170
10 + 90 - 70 = 30
10 - 90 + 70 = -10
10 * 90 + 70 = 900 + 70 = 970
10 * 90 - 70 = 900 - 70 = 830
(10 + 90) * 70 = 100 * 70 = 7000
(90 / 10) = 9. Combine 9, 70. 9+70=79, 9-70=-61, 9*70=630, 70/9 (not integer).
(70 / 10) = 7. Combine 7, 90. 7+90=97. This works!
The expression is (70 / (45 - 35)) + 90.
Let's check the order of operations.
(70 / (45 - 35)) + 90
= (70 / 10) + 90
= 7 + 90
= 97.
This is the same solution found earlier, just written with the 90 at the end.

Case 4: (70 - 35) = 35. Remaining numbers are 90, 45.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 23, 72, 7, and 10, along with the operators +, -, *, /, to reach the target number 46. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  **Start with multiplication/division:**
    *   72 / 23 is not an integer.
    *   72 / 7 is not an integer.
    *   72 / 10 is not an integer.
    *   23 * 7 = 161. Remaining: 72, 10. 161 + 72 + 10 = 243. 161 - 72 - 10 = 79. 161 + 72 - 10 = 223. 161 - 72 + 10 = 99.
    *   23 * 10 = 230. Remaining: 72, 7. 230 + 72 + 7 = 309. 230 - 72 - 7 = 151. 230 + 72 - 7 = 295. 230 - 72 + 7 = 165.
    *   7 * 10 = 70. Remaining: 23, 72. 70 + 23 + 72 = 165. 70 - 23 - 72 = -25. 70 + 23 - 72 = 21. 70 - 23 + 72 = 119.
    *   72 * 7 = 504. Remaining: 23, 10. Too large.
    *   72 * 10 = 720. Remaining: 23, 7. Too large.

2.  **Try combinations involving subtraction to reduce large numbers:**
    *   Let's try to get close to 46.
    *   Maybe use 72 and subtract something. 72 - X = 46, so X = 26. Can we make 26 from 23, 7, 10?
        *   23 + 7 - 10 = 20. No.
        *   23 - 7 + 10 = 26. Yes!
    *   So, the equation could be 72 - (23 - 7 + 10). Let's check the numbers used: 72, 23, 7, 10. All used once.
    *   Let's evaluate: 72 - (23 - 7 + 10) = 72 - (16 + 10) = 72 - 26 = 46. This works.

3.  **Alternative structure:**
    *   What if we try to make 46 directly?
    *   (72 / ?) + ? - ? = 46
    *   (72 / 10) is not integer.
    *   (72 / 7) is not integer.
    *   (72 / 23) is not integer.

    *   Let's try another approach.
    *   (23 * ?) + ? - ? = 46
    *   (23 * 1) is not possible as 1 is not in the list.
    *   (23 * 2) is not possible.

    *   Let's go back to the successful one: 72 - (23 - 7 + 10) = 46.
    *   Can we rearrange it?
    *   72 - 23 + 7 - 10 = 49 + 7 - 10 = 56 - 10 = 46. This also works and uses the numbers 72, 23, 7, 10 exactly once.

Let's verify the second option: 72 - 23 + 7 - 10
Numbers used: 72, 23, 7, 10 (all used once).
Operators used: -, +, - (allowed).
Calculation: 72 - 23 = 49. 49 + 7 = 56. 56 - 10 = 46.
This is a valid solution.

Let's verify the first option: 72 - (23 - 7 + 10)
Numbers used: 72, 23, 7, 10 (all used once).
Operators used: -, -, + (allowed).
Calculation: 23 - 7 = 16. 16 + 10 = 26. 72 - 26 = 46.
This is also a valid solution.

The user asked for ""an equation"". Both are valid. The second one is simpler without parentheses.

Let's try to find another one just in case.
What if we use 10 * 7 = 70?
70 - 23 - ? = 46. 70 - 23 = 47. 47 - ? = 46. ? = 1. Not possible.
70 + 23 - ? = 46. 93 - ? = 46. ? = 47. Not possible.

What if we use 23 * 7 = 161?
161 - 72 - 10 = 79.
161 - 72 + 10 = 99.

What if we use 72 / ?
No integer divisions.

The target value is 90.
The available numbers are [90, 96, 95].
I need to use each number exactly once with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach 90.

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 90, N2 = 96, N3 = 95.
The target is T = 90.

Possible combinations of operations and numbers.
I have three numbers, so I will have two operations.

Let's try starting with the largest number, 96.
Possibility 1: (96 op1 N2) op2 N3 = 90
Possibility 2: N1 op1 (96 op2 N2) = 90

Let's consider the number 90 itself. Since the target is 90, maybe 90 is used in a way that it doesn't change the result significantly, or it's part of a calculation that results in 0 or 1.

If 90 is used as the first number:
90 op1 N2 op2 N3 = 90
If op1 is +, then 90 + N2 op2 N3 = 90. This means N2 op2 N3 must equal 0.
Can 96 and 95 result in 0?
96 + 95 != 0
96 - 95 = 1 != 0
95 - 96 = -1 != 0
96 * 95 != 0
96 / 95 != 0
95 / 96 != 0
So, 90 + (96 op2 95) = 90 is not possible.

If op1 is -, then 90 - N2 op2 N3 = 90. This means N2 op2 N3 must equal 0. Same as above, not possible.

If op1 is *, then 90 * N2 op2 N3 = 90.
This implies N2 op2 N3 must equal 1.
Can 96 and 95 result in 1?
96 + 95 != 1
96 - 95 = 1. Yes!
So, 90 * (96 - 95) = 90 * 1 = 90.
This uses 90, 96, and 95 exactly once.
The operations are * and -.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's double check the rules:
- Use numbers [90 96 95] exactly once. (Yes: 90, 96, 95)
- Use only the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). (Yes: *, -)
- Equation must precisely equal 90. (Yes: 90 * (96 - 95) = 90)

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

What if 90 is the last number?
N1 op1 N2 op2 90 = 90
If op2 is +, then N1 op1 N2 + 90 = 90. This means N1 op1 N2 must equal 0.
Can 96 and 95 result in 0? No, as seen before.

If op2 is -, then N1 op1 N2 - 90 = 90. This means N1 op1 N2 must equal 180.
Can 96 and 95 result in 180?
96 + 95 = 191
96 * 95 = 9120
96 / 95 != 180
95 / 96 != 180
So, this is not possible.

If op2 is *, then N1 op1 N2 * 90 = 90. This means N1 op1 N2 must equal 1.
Can 96 and 95 result in 1?
96 - 95 = 1. Yes!
So, (96 - 95) * 90 = 1 * 90 = 90.
This is the same solution as before, just with the order of multiplication changed.

If op2 is /, then N1 op1 N2 / 90 = 90. This means N1 op1 N2 must equal 8100.
Can 96 and 95 result in 8100?
96 * 95 = 9120. Close, but not 8100.
96 + 95 = 191.
So, this is not possible.

The user wants a single arithmetic equation using the numbers 72, 6, and 12 exactly once.
The allowed operations are +, -, *, /.
The target result is 66.

Let's list the numbers: {72, 6, 12}
Target: 66

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations to get 66.
There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers.
For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation can be one of the 4 fundamental operations. This gives 4^3 = 64 combinations of operations for each permutation.
However, the order of operations matters (parentheses are not explicitly allowed, but implied by the structure of the equation).

Let's try some combinations systematically.

Permutation 1: 72, 6, 12
- 72 + 6 + 12 = 90 (Too high)
- 72 + 6 - 12 = 66 (Found it!)

Let's verify this.
Numbers used: 72, 6, 12 (all used exactly once).
Operations used: +, - (allowed).
Result: 72 + 6 - 12 = 78 - 12 = 66.

This seems to be a valid solution. I should check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough, but the prompt only asks for *a* single equation.

Let's try another permutation to see if it's more complex or if the first one was just lucky.

- 6 + 72 + 12 = 90
- 6 + 72 - 12 = 66 (Found another one!)
  - 6 + 72 - 12 = 78 - 12 = 66. This also works.

- 12 - 6 + 72 = 6 + 72 = 78

Permutation 6: 12, 72, 6

- 12 + 72 - 6 = 78
- 12 - 72 + 6 = -60 + 6 = -54
- 12 * 72 / 6 = 12 * 12 = 144
- 12 / 6 * 72 = 2 * 72 = 144
- 12 / 72 * 6 = (1/6) * 6 = 1
- 12 - 72 / 6 = 12 - 12 = 0

It seems there are multiple solutions. The first one I found, 72 + 6 - 12, is the simplest and directly meets the criteria.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Single arithmetic equation: Yes.
- Utilize every number provided in [72 6 12] precisely once: Yes.
- Evaluated, it must yield the exact value of 66: Yes.
- Restricted to using only the four fundamental operations: +, -, *, /: Yes.

The solution 72 + 6 - 12 = 66 is valid.
Another valid solution is 72 - 12 + 6 = 66.
Another valid solution is 6 + 72 - 12 = 66.
Another valid solution is 6 - 12 + 72 = 66.

I will present the first one I found.

Let's try different combinations:

Let's consider multiplication and then addition/subtraction.
Maybe (A * B) + C or (A * B) - C.

Let's try another order for (30 / 15) * 19.
*   19 * (30 / 15) = 19 * 2 = 38. Same result.

What about other divisions?
*   15 / 30 = 0.5.

    *   0.5 + 19 = 19.5. Not 38.

*   19 / 15 (not integer)
*   19 / 30 (not integer)
*   15 / 19 (not integer)

So, (30 / 15) * 19 seems to be the solution.

Let's verify:

Equation: (30 / 15) * 19

The user wants an equation using the numbers 49, 45, and 94 to reach the target number 98.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [49, 45, 94]
Target: 98

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations.
Let's try different combinations and see if I can get close to 98.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 98
2. a op (b op c) = 98

Let's start with the largest number, 94.
How can I get 98 from 94 using the other numbers (49, 45)?
94 + 4 = 98. Can I make 4 from 49 and 45?
49 - 45 = 4.
So, 94 + (49 - 45) = 98.
This uses all numbers (94, 49, 45) exactly once and the operations (+, -).
Let's check the order of operations.
94 + (49 - 45) = 94 + 4 = 98.
This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

What if I start with 49?
49 * 2 = 98. Can I make 2 from 45 and 94?
94 / 45 is not an integer.
45 / 94 is not an integer.
94 - 45 = 49. Not 2.
45 - 94 = -49. Not 2.
So, 49 * 2 doesn't seem easy to achieve.

What if I start with 45?
45 * x = 98. x = 98/45, not an integer.
45 + x = 98. x = 53. Can I make 53 from 49 and 94?
94 - 49 = 45. Not 53.
49 - 94 = -45. Not 53.
94 + 49 = 143. Not 53.

Let's go back to the first idea: 94 + (49 - 45).
Numbers used: 94, 49, 45. All used once.
Operations used: +, -. Allowed.
Result: 98. Target reached.

Let's consider other arrangements of the first solution:
(49 - 45) + 94 = 4 + 94 = 98. Same solution, just reordered.
94 - (45 - 49) = 94 - (-4) = 94 + 4 = 98. This also works. Numbers: 94, 45, 49. Operations: -, -.

Let's try multiplication.
Can I multiply two numbers to get close to 98?
49 * ?
45 * ?
94 * ?

What if I use division?
(94 / 49) * ? - not integer.
(94 / 45) * ? - not integer.
(49 / 45) * ? - not integer.
(45 / 49) * ? - not integer.
(45 / 94) * ? - not integer.
(49 / 94) * ? - not integer.

What about division resulting in an integer?
94 / 2 = 47. Can I make 2 from 49 and 45? No.
45 / ?
49 / ?

Let's try combining two numbers first and then operating with the third.
(49 + 45) = 94. Then 94 op 94 = 98?
94 + 94 = 188.
94 - 94 = 0.
94 * 94 = large.
94 / 94 = 1.
So (49 + 45) op 94 doesn't work.

(49 - 45) = 4. Then 4 op 94 = 98?
4 + 94 = 98. This is the solution found earlier: (49 - 45) + 94.

(45 - 49) = -4. Then -4 op 94 = 98?
-4 + 94 = 90.
94 + (-4) = 90.
94 - (-4) = 94 + 4 = 98. This is 94 - (45 - 49).

(49 * 45) = 2205. Then 2205 op 94 = 98? Unlikely.
(49 / 45) - not integer.
(45 / 49) - not integer.

(49 + 94) = 143. Then 143 op 45 = 98?
143 - 45 = 98. This is (49 + 94) - 45.
Numbers used: 49, 94, 45. All used once.
Operations used: +, -. Allowed.
Result: 98. Target reached.
This is another valid solution.

(94 - 49) = 45. Then 45 op 45 = 98?
45 + 45 = 90.
45 - 45 = 0.
45 * 45 = large.
45 / 45 = 1.
So (94 - 49) op 45 doesn't work.

(49 * 94) = 4606. Then 4606 op 45 = 98? Unlikely.
(94 / 49) - not integer.
(49 / 94) - not integer.

(45 + 94) = 139. Then 139 op 49 = 98?
139 - 49 = 90.
So (45 + 94) op 49 doesn't work.

(94 - 45) = 49. Then 49 op 49 = 98?
49 + 49 = 98. This is (94 - 45) + 49.
Numbers used: 94, 45, 49. All used once.
Operations used: -, +. Allowed.
Result: 98. Target reached.
This is another valid solution.

(45 * 94) = 4230. Then 4230 op 49 = 98? Unlikely.
(94 / 45) - not integer.
(45 / 94) - not integer.

So I have found three valid solutions:
1. 94 + (49 - 45) = 98
2. (49 + 94) - 45 = 98
3. (94 - 45) + 49 = 98

The user asked for ""an equation"". I can pick any of these.
Let's pick the first one as it was the first one I found.
94 + (49 - 45) = 98

Let's double check the requirements:
- Use all numbers from [49 45 94]: Yes (49, 45, 94)
- Accurately results in 98: Yes (94 + 4 = 98)
- Allowed operations: +, -, *, /: Yes (+, -)
- Each number incorporated exactly once: Yes
- Output only the final equation within <answer></answer> tags.

The equation 94 + (49 - 45) = 98 fits all criteria.
Another one: (49 + 94) - 45 = 143 - 45 = 98. This also fits.
Another one: (94 - 45) + 49 = 49 + 49 = 98. This also fits.

I will provide the first one I found.
94 + (49 - 45) = 98.
The parentheses are important for clarity and order of operations.
If I wrote 94 + 49 - 45, it would still be 143 - 45 = 98.

4523,1761,"<think>The problem asks me to use the digits [44, 23, 39, 22] exactly once, along with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to form an equation that evaluates to 87.

Let's list the numbers: 44, 23, 39, 22.
The target is 87.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations. This means I'll have three operations in total.

Let's try some combinations. The numbers are relatively large, so multiplication might quickly exceed the target or get close. Division might be tricky as it needs to result in integers or lead to a path that resolves to an integer.

Let's consider the target number 87.
Possible ways to get 87:
- Sums: 80+7, 70+17, 60+27, 50+37, etc.
- Differences: 90-3, 100-13, etc.
- Products: 3 * 29, etc. (not directly helpful with the given numbers)
- Divisions: 174/2, etc.

Let's try to combine the given numbers in pairs first and see what results we get.

Pair 1: 44 and 23
44 + 23 = 67
44 - 23 = 21
23 - 44 = -21

Pair 3: 44 and 22
44 + 22 = 66
44 - 22 = 22
22 - 44 = -22
44 * 22 = 968 (too large)
44 / 22 = 2
22 / 44 = 0.5 (not an integer)

Pair 4: 23 and 39

The results from pairing are: 67, 21, -21, 83, 5, -5, 66, 22, -22, 2, 62, -16, 16, 45, 1, -1, 61, 17, -17.

Now let's try to combine these intermediate results with the remaining numbers.

Consider the pair (44, 22) giving 2. The remaining numbers are 23 and 39.
We have 2, 23, 39. Target is 87.
Possible combinations:
(2 * 23) + 39 = 46 + 39 = 85 (close)
(2 * 39) + 23 = 78 + 23 = 101
(2 + 23) * 39 = 25 * 39 = 975 (too large)
(2 + 39) * 23 = 41 * 23 = 943 (too large)
(23 + 39) * 2 = 62 * 2 = 124
(23 - 2) * 39 = 21 * 39 = 819 (too large)
(39 - 2) * 23 = 37 * 23 = 851 (too large)
(23 * 39) + 2 = 897 + 2 = 899 (too large)
(23 * 2) + 39 = 46 + 39 = 85 (close)

39 + 23 - 2 = 62 - 2 = 60
39 - 23 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18
39 - 23 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14
23 - 39 + 2 = -16 + 2 = -14
23 - 39 - 2 = -16 - 2 = -18

Let's re-evaluate the (44 / 22) = 2 path.
We have 2, 23, 39. Target 87.
We tried (2 * 23) + 39 = 85. This is 2 away from 87.
Can we adjust this?
The original numbers were 44, 22, 23, 39.
The equation so far is (44 / 22) * 23 + 39 = 85.
We need to get +2 more.
If we change the last operation from +39 to something else.
(44 / 22) * 23 = 46. We need 87 - 46 = 41 from 39. Not possible.

Let's try another grouping for (44 / 22) = 2.
We have 2, 23, 39. Target 87.
Try combining 23 and 39 first.
23 + 39 = 62. Then combine with 2. 62 + 2 = 64. 62 * 2 = 124. 62 - 2 = 60. 2 - 62 = -60.
23 - 39 = -16. Then combine with 2. -16 + 2 = -14. -16 * 2 = -32. -16 - 2 = -18. 2 - (-16) = 18.
39 - 23 = 16. Then combine with 2. 16 + 2 = 18. 16 * 2 = 32. 16 - 2 = 14. 2 - 16 = -14.

Let's try combining 2 and 39 first.

Let's try to use the large numbers to get something close to 19, and then adjust with the remaining numbers.

What if I divide 95 by something?
95 / 5 = 19. I don't have 5.
Can I make 5 from 50, 34, 8?
50 / 10 = 5. Can I make 10 from 34, 8? 34-8 = 26, 34+8 = 42, 34*8 = 272, 34/8 (not integer). No.
50 / (34-8) = 50 / 26 (not integer)

What if I divide 50 by something?
50 / 2 = 25. Can I make 2 from 95, 34, 8? No.
50 / 5 = 10. Can I make 5 from 95, 34, 8? No.

Let's try to get 19 by subtracting from a larger number.
Maybe something like (95 + 50) - X = 19?
145 - X = 19 => X = 145 - 19 = 126. Can I make 126 from 34 and 8? 34*8 = 272, 34+8 = 42, 34-8 = 26. No.

Maybe something like (95 - 50) + X = 19?
45 + X = 19 => X = 19 - 45 = -26. Can I make -26 from 34 and 8? No.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe one of the numbers is multiplied by a small result from the others.
For example, 8 * (something) = 19? No, 19 is not divisible by 8.
34 * (something) = 19? No.
50 * (something) = 19? No.
95 * (something) = 19? No.

Let's try division again.
What if I divide a large number by a combination of others?
(95 + 50 + 34 + 8) = 187. Not 19.

Let's try to get 19 by dividing a number by a result.
For example, 95 / (something) = 19. This means (something) must be 5.
Can I make 5 from 50, 34, 8?
50 / 10 = 5. Can I make 10 from 34, 8? No.
(34 + 8) / ? = 5 => 42 / ? = 5. No.
(34 - 8) / ? = 5 => 26 / ? = 5. No.

What if I use 50?
50 / (something) = 19? No.

What if I use 34?
34 / (something) = 19? No.

What if I use 8?
8 / (something) = 19? No.

Let's try to get 19 by adding or subtracting results.
Maybe (95 / X) + Y = 19.
If X = 5, then 95/5 = 19. Then Y must be 0. Can I make 0 from 50, 34, 8? No.

Let's try to get 19 by subtracting a result from another result.
(95 - 50) - (34 - 8) = 45 - 26 = 19.
This uses all numbers: 95, 50, 34, 8.
The operations are subtraction and subtraction.
Let's check:
95 - 50 = 45
34 - 8 = 26
45 - 26 = 19.
This works.

Let's write it out clearly.
Numbers: [95, 50, 34, 8]
Target: 19

Step 1: Calculate the difference between 95 and 50.
95 - 50 = 45

Step 2: Calculate the difference between 34 and 8.
34 - 8 = 26

Step 3: Subtract the result of Step 2 from the result of Step 1.
45 - 26 = 19

This equation uses all numbers exactly once and results in the target value.

2.  (66 + 64) - 41 = 130 - 41 = 89. Too high.

Let's verify:
64 - (66 - 41)
First, calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 66 - 41 = 25.
Then, subtract this result from 64: 64 - 25 = 39.

The numbers available are [92, 95, 61, 92].

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 92, 95, 61, 92
Target: 51

We need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. The order of operations matters, so we can use parentheses.

Let's consider the magnitude of the numbers. We have two 92s, a 95, and a 61. These are all relatively large numbers. The target, 51, is significantly smaller than most of these numbers. This suggests that division or subtraction will likely play a crucial role in reducing the values.

Let's try some initial combinations, focusing on how to get closer to 51.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
(95 + 92) = 187. Still too large.
(95 * 92) = 8644. Much too large.
(95 - 92) = 3. This is small.
(92 / 92) = 1. This is also small.

Let's try to combine two numbers first and then incorporate the others.

Combination 1: (92 / 92) = 1.
Now we have 1, 95, 61. Target is 51.
Can we get 51 from 1, 95, 61?
(95 - 61) = 34. Then 34 + 1 = 35. Not 51.
(95 + 61) = 156. Then 156 - 1 = 155. Not 51.
(95 * 1) = 95. Then 95 - 61 = 34. Not 51.
(61 * 1) = 61. Then 95 - 61 = 34. Not 51.
(95 - 1) = 94. Then 94 - 61 = 33. Not 51.
(61 - 1) = 60. Then 95 - 60 = 35. Not 51.

This path (92/92) doesn't seem promising.

We have 31, 95, 92. Target 51.

Let's check:
Numbers used: 69, 21, 74, 64. All used exactly once.

This works.

Another possibility:

If we multiply 21 by something, it gets big fast.
If we multiply 64 by something, it gets big fast.
If we multiply 69 by something, it gets big fast.
If we multiply 74 by something, it gets big fast.

What about division?
Can we make a number that, when divided, helps?
Example: (69 + 21) = 90.
(74 + 64) = 138.
(69 - 21) = 48.
(74 - 64) = 10.
(64 - 21) = 43.
(74 - 21) = 53.
(69 - 64) = 5.

Let's revisit (69 + 21) - 74 + 64 = 80. This is a valid solution.

Let's try to see if there are other solutions.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 80.
Or A + B - (C * D) = 80.

Consider (74 + 6) where 6 is derived from other numbers.
(74 + (64 / X))?
(74 + (64 / 21)) - 69? Not integer.
(74 + (64 / 69))? Not integer.

What if we try to make 80 directly?
Maybe 74 + 6 = 80. Can we make 6 from 69, 21, 64?
69 - 64 = 5. Need 21. 5 + 21 = 26. 5 - 21 (negative).
64 - 21 = 43. Need 69. 43 - 69 (negative).
69 - 21 = 48. Need 64. 48 - 64 (negative).

Maybe 64 + 16 = 80. Can we make 16 from 69, 21, 74?
74 - 69 = 5. Need 21. 5 + 21 = 26. 5 - 21 (negative).
74 - 21 = 53. Need 69. 53 - 69 (negative).
69 - 21 = 48. Need 74. 48 - 74 (negative).

Let's go back to the first solution found: (69 + 21) - 74 + 64 = 80.
This is a perfectly valid solution.

Let's try another structure: A - B + C + D = 80.
74 - 69 + 21 + 64 = 5 + 21 + 64 = 26 + 64 = 90. (Close but not 80)
74 - 21 + 69 + 64 = 53 + 69 + 64 = 122 + 64 = 186.
69 - 21 + 74 + 64 = 48 + 74 + 64 = 122 + 64 = 186.

Let's try A + B + C - D = 80.
69 + 21 + 64 - 74 = 90 + 64 - 74 = 154 - 74 = 80.
This is another valid solution.
Numbers used: 69, 21, 64, 74. All used exactly once.
Operations: +, +, -. Basic arithmetic.
Result: 80.

Let's verify:
69 + 21 = 90
90 + 64 = 154
154 - 74 = 80.

This is also a valid solution. The user asked for *an* equation. I will provide one of them. The second one is slightly simpler in terms of operations.

Let's check if there's a multiplication/division one.
(74 * 21) / 69 + 64? Too complex and likely not integer.
(64 * 21) / 69 + 74?
(69 * 21) / 74 + 64?

Consider (74 + 6) = 80. Can we make 6 from 69, 21, 64?
(69 - 64) = 5. Need 21. 5 + 21 = 26.
(64 - 21) = 43. Need 69.
(69 - 21) = 48. Need 64.

3935,1852,"<think>The target number is 98. The available numbers are 3, 68, and 10. I need to use each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's try combinations:

1.  **Addition/Subtraction focused:**
    *   68 + 10 + 3 = 81 (Too low)
    *   68 + 10 - 3 = 75 (Too low)
    *   68 - 10 + 3 = 61 (Too low)
    *   68 - 10 - 3 = 55 (Too low)
    *   10 + 3 + 68 = 81 (Same as above)
    *   10 + 3 - 68 = -55 (Too low)
    *   3 + 10 + 68 = 81 (Same as above)
    *   3 + 10 - 68 = -55 (Too low)

2.  **Multiplication involved:**
    *   Try multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the third.
    *   68 * 3 = 204.
        *   204 + 10 = 214 (Too high)
        *   204 - 10 = 194 (Too high)
        *   10 - 204 = -194 (Too low)
    *   68 * 10 = 680. (Way too high)
    *   3 * 10 = 30.
        *   30 + 68 = 98. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 3, 10, 68. Each used once.
Operations used: *, +. Basic operations.
Result: 3 * 10 + 68 = 30 + 68 = 98.

This is a valid solution.
Another possible order for the same calculation:
68 + (3 * 10) = 68 + 30 = 98.
(10 * 3) + 68 = 30 + 68 = 98.
68 + (10 * 3) = 68 + 30 = 98.

Let's check if division could be involved.
*   68 / 3 is not an integer.
*   68 / 10 is not an integer.
*   10 / 3 is not an integer.
*   3 / 68 is not an integer.
*   3 / 10 is not an integer.
*   10 / 68 is not an integer.

So, division is unlikely to be useful unless it cancels out nicely, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

The solution `3 * 10 + 68` is the most straightforward.
I will present it as `3 * 10 + 68`.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 23, 23, and 31 exactly once, combined with only +, -, *, /, to equal 31.

Let the numbers be $n_1 = 23$, $n_2 = 23$, $n_3 = 31$.
The target sum is 31.

I need to arrange these three numbers and three operators to get 31.
The possible structures are:
1. $(n_1 \text{ op1 } n_2) \text{ op2 } n_3 = 31$
2. $n_1 \text{ op1 } (n_2 \text{ op2 } n_3) = 31$

Let's try structure 1: $(23 \text{ op1 } 23) \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$.

Case 1.1: $(23 + 23) \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
$46 \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
If op2 is +, $46 + 31 = 77 \neq 31$.
If op2 is -, $46 - 31 = 15 \neq 31$.
If op2 is *, $46 * 31$ is very large, not 31.
If op2 is /, $46 / 31$ is not an integer, not 31.

Case 1.2: $(23 - 23) \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
$0 \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
If op2 is +, $0 + 31 = 31$. This works!
The equation is $(23 - 23) + 31 = 31$.
Let's check the constraints:
- Numbers used: 23, 23, 31. Yes, all used exactly once.
- Operations used: -, +. Yes, only basic arithmetic operations.
- Result: 31. Yes, the sum is 31.

This seems to be a valid solution. Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough, although I've found one.

Case 1.3: $(23 * 23) \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
$529 \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
If op2 is +, $529 + 31$ is large.
If op2 is -, $529 - 31 = 498 \neq 31$.
If op2 is *, $529 * 31$ is large.
If op2 is /, $529 / 31 = 17.06... \neq 31$.

Case 1.4: $(23 / 23) \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
$1 \text{ op2 } 31 = 31$
If op2 is +, $1 + 31 = 32 \neq 31$.
If op2 is -, $1 - 31 = -30 \neq 31$.
If op2 is *, $1 * 31 = 31$. This works!
The equation is $(23 / 23) * 31 = 31$.
Let's check the constraints:
- Numbers used: 23, 23, 31. Yes, all used exactly once.
- Operations used: /, *. Yes, only basic arithmetic operations.
- Result: 31. Yes, the sum is 31.

This is another valid solution. The problem asks for *an* equation, so either is fine. I'll present the first one I found as it's simpler.

Let's quickly check structure 2: $23 \text{ op1 } (23 \text{ op2 } 31) = 31$.

Case 2.1: $23 + (23 \text{ op2 } 31) = 31$
$(23 \text{ op2 } 31)$ must equal $31 - 23 = 8$.
If op2 is +, $23 + 31 = 54 \neq 8$.
If op2 is -, $23 - 31 = -8 \neq 8$.
If op2 is *, $23 * 31$ is large.
If op2 is /, $23 / 31$ is not 8.

Case 2.2: $23 - (23 \text{ op2 } 31) = 31$
$(23 \text{ op2 } 31)$ must equal $23 - 31 = -8$.
If op2 is +, $23 + 31 = 54 \neq -8$.
If op2 is -, $23 - 31 = -8$. This works!
The equation is $23 - (23 - 31) = 31$.
Let's check the constraints:
- Numbers used: 23, 23, 31. Yes, all used exactly once.
- Operations used: -, -. Yes, only basic arithmetic operations.
- Result: 31. Yes, the sum is 31.

This is a third valid solution.

Case 2.3: $23 * (23 \text{ op2 } 31) = 31$
$(23 \text{ op2 } 31)$ must equal $31 / 23$, which is not an integer. So this path won't yield a simple integer solution.

Case 2.4: $23 / (23 \text{ op2 } 31) = 31$
$(23 \text{ op2 } 31)$ must equal $23 / 31$, which is not an integer.

So I have found three valid solutions:
1. $(23 - 23) + 31 = 31$
2. $(23 / 23) * 31 = 31$
3. $23 - (23 - 31) = 31$

The simplest one is $(23 - 23) + 31 = 31$. I will use this one.
The problem asks for the equation to yield the *exact sum* of 31. This implies the final result should be 31. All my solutions result in 31.

Let's re-read the prompt carefully: ""devise an equation where the numbers listed in [23 23 31] are combined to yield the exact sum of 31.""
""yield the exact sum of 31"" - this phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the final result of the calculation must be 31, or does it mean one of the numbers in the set (31) must be the result? Given the context of mathematical puzzles, it almost certainly means the final result of the expression must be 31.

I will present the first solution found: $(23 - 23) + 31 = 31$.
It uses 23, 23, 31 once each.
It uses only +, -.
It results in 31.
All constraints are met.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 50, 4, and 20 to reach the target number 66.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try different combinations:

1.  (50 + 4) * 20 = 54 * 20 = 1080 (Too high)
2.  (50 - 4) * 20 = 46 * 20 = 920 (Too high)

7.  50 + (4 * 20) = 50 + 80 = 130 (Too high)
8.  50 - (4 * 20) = 50 - 80 = -30 (Not 66)

19. 50 + 4 + 20 = 74 (Close, but not 66)
20. 50 + 4 - 20 = 34 (Not 66)
21. 50 - 4 + 20 = 66 (This works!)

28. 4 * 50 - 20 = 180 (Already checked)
29. 4 / 50 + 20 = 0.08 + 20 = 20.08 (Not 66)
30. 4 / 50 - 20 = 0.08 - 20 = -19.92 (Not 66)
31. 20 * 50 + 4 = 1000 + 4 = 1004 (Too high)

34. 20 / 50 - 4 = 0.4 - 4 = -3.6 (Not 66)

Let's re-check combination 21:
50 - 4 + 20
First, 50 - 4 = 46.
Then, 46 + 20 = 66.
This equation uses 50, 4, and 20 exactly once and results in 66.

Let's consider order of operations if parentheses are not explicitly used.
50 - 4 + 20 = 66 (Subtraction and addition have equal precedence, evaluated left to right)
This is correct.

What about other possibilities?
Maybe division is involved in a way that results in an integer.
(50 + 20) / 4 = 70 / 4 = 17.5 (Not 66)
(50 - 20) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5 (Not 66)
(20 - 4) / 50 = 16 / 50 = 0.32 (Not 66)
(50 * 20) / 4 = 1000 / 4 = 250 (Not 66)
(50 * 4) / 20 = 200 / 20 = 10 (Not 66)
(20 * 4) / 50 = 80 / 50 = 1.6 (Not 66)

Let's try multiplication with addition/subtraction.
50 + (20 - 4) = 50 + 16 = 66.
This also works!
It uses 50, 20, and 4 exactly once.
The operations are +, -.
The result is 66.

Let's verify this one:
50 + (20 - 4)
First, calculate the expression in parentheses: 20 - 4 = 16.
Then, add 50 to the result: 50 + 16 = 66.
This is a valid solution.

Both `50 - 4 + 20` and `50 + (20 - 4)` are valid. The prompt asks for *an* equation. I will provide one. `50 - 4 + 20` is simpler as it doesn't require parentheses if standard order of operations is assumed. However, `50 + (20 - 4)` is also perfectly valid and explicitly shows the grouping. I'll go with the one that is perhaps more explicit about the steps.

Let's double check the prompt: ""construct an equation using the set of numbers [50 4 20] that yields 66. You are permitted to use standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), and every number from the set must be incorporated exactly one time.""

Equation 1: 50 - 4 + 20 = 66
Numbers used: 50, 4, 20 (all used once)
Operations: -, + (standard arithmetic)
Result: 66

Equation 2: 50 + (20 - 4) = 66

Both are correct. I'll choose the second one as it might be less ambiguous for some.

The student needs to create an equation that equals 45 using the numbers [86, 43, 84] and only the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Each number must be used exactly once.

My strategy will be to try different combinations of operations and groupings. Since 45 is a relatively small number compared to the given numbers, division or subtraction will likely be involved to reduce the values.

Let's start by looking at the numbers: 86, 43, 84.
Notice that 86 is close to 2 * 43. This might be a useful relationship.
Also, 84 is close to 2 * 42, or 3 * 28.

Let's try to combine two numbers first and then incorporate the third.

Possibility 1: Start with 86 and 43.
*   86 + 43 = 129. Then use 84. 129 + 84 = 213 (too big). 129 - 84 = 45. This looks promising! Let's check if we used all numbers and operations correctly.
    Equation: 86 + 43 - 84 = 45.
    Numbers used: 86, 43, 84 (all used once).
    Operations used: +, - (basic operations).
    Result: 45.
    This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough and demonstrate the process.

Possibility 2: Start with 86 and 84.
*   86 + 84 = 170. Use 43. 170 - 43 = 127 (too big). 170 + 43 = 213 (too big). 170 / 43 (not a whole number). 170 * 43 (way too big).
*   86 - 84 = 2. Use 43. 2 + 43 = 45. This is another potential solution!
    Equation: 86 - 84 + 43 = 45.
    Numbers used: 86, 84, 43 (all used once).
    Operations used: -, + (basic operations).
    Result: 45.
    This is also a valid solution.

Possibility 3: Start with 43 and 84.
*   43 + 84 = 127. Use 86. 127 - 86 = 41 (close, but not 45). 127 + 86 = 213.
*   84 - 43 = 41. Use 86. 41 + 86 = 127. 86 - 41 = 45. This is another potential solution!
    Equation: 86 - (84 - 43) = 45.
    Numbers used: 86, 84, 43 (all used once).
    Operations used: -, - (basic operations).
    Result: 86 - 41 = 45.
    This is also a valid solution.

*   43 * 84 (too big).
*   84 / 43 (not a whole number).

Let's consider multiplication and division more directly.
We know 86 = 2 * 43.
What if we try to get 45 by dividing a larger number?
For example, if we could make 90, then 90 / 2 = 45. But we don't have a 2.

Let's revisit the 86 = 2 * 43 observation.
Can we use this?
Maybe something like (86 / 43) * something?
86 / 43 = 2.
Now we have 2 and 84. We need to get 45.
2 + 84 = 86.
84 - 2 = 82.
2 * 84 = 168.
84 / 2 = 42.
None of these lead to 45.

What about (84 / 43)? Not a whole number.

Let's go back to the simpler additive/subtractive combinations.
We found:
1.  86 + 43 - 84 = 45
2.  86 - 84 + 43 = 45
3.  86 - (84 - 43) = 45

All three are valid. I will present one of them. The first one is straightforward.

Let's double-check the rules:
-   Equation equals 45. (Yes)
-   Numbers: [86, 43, 84]. (Yes, all used once)
-   Operations: +, -, *, /. (Yes, only + and - used)
-   Every number from the set must be incorporated exactly once. (Yes)

Let's try combining the numbers.
I can see 97 is close to 92. Maybe I can subtract something from 97.
97 - ? = 92. So, ? = 5.
Can I make 5 from 60, 47, and 82?
60 - 47 = 13. Not 5.
82 - 60 = 22. Not 5.
82 - 47 = 35. Not 5.
60 / ?

82 / ?

Let's try combining other numbers first.
Maybe I can add two numbers and subtract the others.
60 + 47 = 107.
107 - 97 = 10. Then I have 82 left. 10 + 82 = 92. This works!
The equation would be (60 + 47) - 97 + 82.
Let's check:
60 + 47 = 107
107 - 97 = 10
10 + 82 = 92.
This uses all numbers [60, 47, 97, 82] exactly once and results in 92.

Let's try another approach to be sure.
Maybe multiplication or division is involved.
82 is close to 92.
82 + 10 = 92. Can I make 10 from 60, 47, 97?
97 - 60 - 47 = 37 - 47 = -10. Not 10.
97 - (60 + 47) = 97 - 107 = -10. Not 10.
(97 - 60) - 47 = 37 - 47 = -10. Not 10.

Let's try starting with 60.
60 + ? = 92. So, ? = 32.
Can I make 32 from 47, 97, 82?
97 - 47 = 50. Not 32.
82 - 47 = 35. Close.
82 - 47 + ?
82 - 47 = 35. I have 97 left. 35 + 97 is too big. 35 - 97 is negative.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: (60 + 47) - 97 + 82.
This seems correct and uses all numbers.
The order of operations matters. Parentheses can clarify.
(60 + 47) - 97 + 82 = 107 - 97 + 82 = 10 + 82 = 92.

Let's consider if there are other ways.
Maybe 82 + (something).
82 + (97 - 60 - 47) = 82 + (37 - 47) = 82 + (-10) = 72. Incorrect.
82 + (97 - (60 + 47)) = 82 + (97 - 107) = 82 + (-10) = 72. Incorrect.

What about 97 - (something)?
97 - (82 - 60 + 47) = 97 - (22 + 47) = 97 - 69 = 28. Incorrect.
97 - (82 + 47 - 60) = 97 - (129 - 60) = 97 - 69 = 28. Incorrect.

Let's re-verify the first solution: (60 + 47) - 97 + 82.
Numbers used: 60, 47, 97, 82. All used once.
Operations: +, -, +. Allowed.
Result: 92. Correct.

Another possibility: 82 + 97 - 60 - 47
82 + 97 = 179
179 - 60 = 119
119 - 47 = 72. Incorrect.

Another possibility: 97 + 82 - 60 - 47
97 + 82 = 179
179 - 60 = 119
119 - 47 = 72. Incorrect.

Another possibility: 60 + 82 - 97 + 47
60 + 82 = 142
142 - 97 = 45
45 + 47 = 92. This also works!
Numbers used: 60, 82, 97, 47. All used once.
Operations: +, -, +. Allowed.
Result: 92. Correct.

So, I have two valid solutions:
1. (60 + 47) - 97 + 82
2. 60 + 82 - 97 + 47

The problem asks for ""an equation"". I will present one. The second one is slightly simpler without explicit parentheses.

Let's check the second one again: 60 + 82 - 97 + 47
60 + 82 = 142
142 - 97 = 45
45 + 47 = 92.

This is a valid solution.

The user wants a single arithmetic equation that equals 61 using the numbers [25, 66, 23, 6] exactly once, and only the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: 25, 66, 23, 6.
Target: 61.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. I should try different groupings and orders of operations.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to 61 and then use the remaining numbers to adjust.
3. Consider division first, as it can significantly change the magnitude of numbers.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(66 - 25) * ?
66 - 25 = 41.
Remaining numbers: 23, 6.
Can I get 61 from 41 and 23, 6?
41 + 23 = 64. Need to subtract 3. Can't get 3 from 6.
41 + 6 = 47. Need to add 14. Can't get 14 from 23.
41 * 23 is too large.
41 / 23 is not an integer.
41 * 6 is too large.
41 / 6 is not an integer.

Attempt 2:
(66 + 25) - ?
66 + 25 = 91.
Remaining numbers: 23, 6.
Can I get 61 from 91 and 23, 6?
91 - 23 = 68. Need to subtract 7. Can't get 7 from 6.
91 - 6 = 85. Need to subtract 24. Can't get 24 from 23.
91 - (23 + 6) = 91 - 29 = 62. Close, but not 61.
91 - (23 - 6) = 91 - 17 = 74.
91 - (6 - 23) = 91 - (-17) = 108.
91 - (23 * 6) = 91 - 138 = -47.
91 - (23 / 6) - not integer.
91 - (6 / 23) - not integer.

Attempt 3:
(66 / 6) * ?
66 / 6 = 11.
Remaining numbers: 25, 23.
Can I get 61 from 11 and 25, 23?
11 * 25 = 275. Too large.
11 + 25 = 36. Need to add 25. Can't get 25 from 23.
11 + 23 = 34. Need to add 27. Can't get 27 from 25.
11 * 23 = 253. Too large.
11 + 25 + 23 = 59. Close.
11 + 25 - 23 = 13.
11 - 25 + 23 = 9.
11 - 25 - 23 = -37.
11 + (25 * 23) = 11 + 575 = 586.
11 * (25 + 23) = 11 * 48 = 528.
11 * (25 - 23) = 11 * 2 = 22.
11 * (23 - 25) = 11 * (-2) = -22.

Attempt 4:
Let's try to make a number close to 61 using multiplication.
25 * 6 = 150. Too large.
25 * 23 = 575. Too large.
66 * 6 = 396. Too large.
66 * 23 = 1518. Too large.

Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 61 and subtract.
Or slightly smaller and add.

Consider 25.
25 + ? = 61. Need 36.
Can I get 36 from 66, 23, 6?
66 - 23 - 6 = 43 - 6 = 37. Close.
66 - (23 + 6) = 66 - 29 = 37.
66 - (23 - 6) = 66 - 17 = 49.
66 - (6 - 23) = 66 - (-17) = 83.
66 / 6 = 11. 11 + 23 = 34. Close.
66 / 23 - not integer.
23 * 6 = 138. Too large.
23 + 6 = 29. 66 - 29 = 37.

Consider 66.
66 - ? = 61. Need 5.
Can I get 5 from 25, 23, 6?
25 - 23 = 2. Need 3 more. Can't get 3 from 6.
25 - 6 = 19.
23 - 6 = 17.
25 / 6 - not integer.
23 / 6 - not integer.
25 / 23 - not integer.
(25 - 23) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8.
(25 + 6) - 23 = 31 - 23 = 8.
(23 + 6) - 25 = 29 - 25 = 4. Close.
(25 - 6) - 23 = 19 - 23 = -4.
(6 - 25) + 23 = -19 + 23 = 4.
(6 - 23) + 25 = -17 + 25 = 8.

Let's try to make 61 directly.
Maybe a large number divided by something, then add/subtract.
(25 * 6) = 150.
(66 * 6) = 396.
(25 * 23) = 575.
(66 * 23) = 1518.

Let's try division first.
66 / 6 = 11. Numbers left: 25, 23. Target from 11: 61. Need 50.
Can I get 50 from 25, 23?
25 + 23 = 48. Close.
25 * 23 = 575.
25 - 23 = 2.
23 - 25 = -2.
So, 11 + 25 + 23 = 59. Not 61.

What if I use multiplication to get close to 61?
25 * 2 = 50. Can I make 2 from 66, 23, 6?
66 / (23 + 6) = 66 / 29 - not integer.
(66 - 23) / 6 = 43 / 6 - not integer.
(66 - 6) / 23 = 60 / 23 - not integer.
(23 - 6) = 17.
(66 - 23) = 43.
(66 - 6) = 60.

Let's try to construct 61 from scratch.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D or (A + B) * C / D.

Consider the numbers again: 25, 66, 23, 6. Target: 61.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 61 and subtract.
Example: 66. Need to subtract 5. Can I make 5 from 25, 23, 6?
(25 - 23) = 2. Need 3. Can't get 3 from 6.
(23 - 6) = 17.
(25 - 6) = 19.
(25 + 6) - 23 = 31 - 23 = 8.

3269,476,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 1, 37, and 16 exactly once, along with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to form an equation that evaluates to 52.

I need to explore different combinations of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 1, 37, 16.
Target value: 52.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then incorporating the third.

Attempt 1: Start with multiplication.
37 * 1 = 37. Then I need to get 52 from 37 and 16. 52 - 37 = 15. I can't get 15 from 16 using +, -, *, /.
37 * 16 = 592. This is too large.
1 * 16 = 16. Then I need to get 52 from 16 and 37. 52 - 16 = 36. I can't get 36 from 37 using +, -, *, /.

Attempt 2: Start with addition.
37 + 1 = 38. Then I need to get 52 from 38 and 16. 52 - 38 = 14. I can't get 14 from 16.
37 + 16 = 53. Then I need to get 52 from 53 and 1. 53 - 1 = 52. This works! The numbers used are 37, 16, and 1. The operations are + and -.
The equation would be (37 + 16) - 1 = 53 - 1 = 52.
This uses all numbers (1, 37, 16) exactly once and only allowed operations.

Let's verify this.
Numbers: 1, 37, 16.
Operations: +, -.
Equation: (37 + 16) - 1.
Step 1: 37 + 16 = 53.
Step 2: 53 - 1 = 52.
The result is 52. All numbers are used exactly once.

Let's try other combinations to be thorough, though I've found a valid solution.

Attempt 3: Start with subtraction.
37 - 1 = 36. Then I need to get 52 from 36 and 16. 52 - 36 = 16. I can get 16 from 16 by adding 0, but I can't use 0. Or 36 + 16 = 52. This uses 37, 1, and 16. The equation would be (37 - 1) + 16 = 36 + 16 = 52. This also works.
Numbers: 1, 37, 16.
Operations: -, +.
Equation: (37 - 1) + 16.
Step 1: 37 - 1 = 36.
Step 2: 36 + 16 = 52.
The result is 52. All numbers are used exactly once.

Let's try another subtraction order.
16 - 1 = 15. Then I need to get 52 from 15 and 37. 52 - 15 = 37. So, 15 + 37 = 52. The equation would be (16 - 1) + 37 = 15 + 37 = 52. This also works.
Numbers: 1, 37, 16.
Operations: -, +.
Equation: (16 - 1) + 37.
Step 1: 16 - 1 = 15.
Step 2: 15 + 37 = 52.
The result is 52. All numbers are used exactly once.

Let's try division. Division might be tricky as it needs to result in whole numbers or be part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.
37 / 1 = 37. Then need 52 from 37 and 16. 52 - 37 = 15. Can't get 15 from 16.
16 / 1 = 16. Then need 52 from 16 and 37. 52 - 16 = 36. Can't get 36 from 37.
37 / 16 is not an integer.
16 / 37 is not an integer.
1 / 37 is not an integer.
1 / 16 is not an integer.

Let's consider expressions like a * b + c or a + b * c.
1 * 37 + 16 = 37 + 16 = 53. Close, but not 52.
1 * 16 + 37 = 16 + 37 = 53. Close, but not 52.
37 * 1 + 16 = 37 + 16 = 53.
37 * 16 + 1 = 592 + 1 = 593.
16 * 1 + 37 = 16 + 37 = 53.
16 * 37 + 1 = 592 + 1 = 593.

Let's consider a * b - c or a - b * c.
37 * 1 - 16 = 37 - 16 = 21.
37 * 16 - 1 = 592 - 1 = 591.
1 * 37 - 16 = 37 - 16 = 21.
1 * 16 - 37 = 16 - 37 = -21.
16 * 1 - 37 = 16 - 37 = -21.
16 * 37 - 1 = 592 - 1 = 591.

Let's consider a + b - c.
37 + 1 - 16 = 38 - 16 = 22.
37 + 16 - 1 = 53 - 1 = 52. (Found this one already)
1 + 37 - 16 = 38 - 16 = 22.
1 + 16 - 37 = 17 - 37 = -20.
16 + 1 - 37 = 17 - 37 = -20.
16 + 37 - 1 = 53 - 1 = 52. (Found this one already)

Let's consider a - b + c.
37 - 1 + 16 = 36 + 16 = 52. (Found this one already)
37 - 16 + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22.
1 - 37 + 16 = -36 + 16 = -20.
1 - 16 + 37 = -15 + 37 = 22.
16 - 1 + 37 = 15 + 37 = 52. (Found this one already)
16 - 37 + 1 = -21 + 1 = -20.

Let's consider expressions involving division that might work.
For example, (a / b) * c or a * (b / c).
If we use 16 / 1 = 16, then 16 * 37 is too big. 16 + 37 = 53. 16 - 37 = -21.
If we use 37 / 1 = 37, then 37 * 16 is too big. 37 + 16 = 53. 37 - 16 = 21.

What about something like (a + b) / c?
(37 + 1) / 16 = 38 / 16 (not integer)
(37 + 16) / 1 = 53 / 1 = 53.
(1 + 16) / 37 = 17 / 37 (not integer)

What about something like a / (b + c)?
37 / (1 + 16) = 37 / 17 (not integer)
16 / (1 + 37) = 16 / 38 (not integer)

The user wants me to find a single mathematical equation that uses the numbers [14, 60, 38, 49] exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target number 73.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 14, 60, 38, 49
Target: 73

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations to get 73. I can try different combinations and orders.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust.
2. Try to create numbers close to 73 and then use the remaining numbers to adjust.
3. Consider the properties of the numbers (even/odd, divisibility).

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(60 + 49) - 38 - 14 = 109 - 38 - 14 = 71 - 14 = 57 (Too low)
(60 + 49) - (38 - 14) = 109 - 24 = 85 (Too high)
(60 + 49) - (38 + 14) = 109 - 52 = 57 (Too low)

Attempt 2:
(60 - 14) + 38 - 49 = 46 + 38 - 49 = 84 - 49 = 35 (Too low)
(60 - 14) + (49 - 38) = 46 + 11 = 57 (Too low)

Attempt 3:
(60 * 14) ... this will be too large.
(60 / 14) ... not an integer.
(60 / 38) ... not an integer.
(60 / 49) ... not an integer.

Attempt 4:
Let's try to get close to 73.
Maybe combine two numbers to get something near 73, then use the others.
49 + 38 = 87.
87 - 14 = 73.
Now I need to use 60. How can I incorporate 60 without changing the result of 73?
I can add 60 and then subtract 60.
So, (49 + 38 - 14) + 60 - 60 = 73.
This uses all numbers: 49, 38, 14, 60, 60. But 60 is used twice. This is not allowed.

Let's rethink. All numbers must be used *exactly once*.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with another, gets close to 73.
Maybe multiplication is involved to reduce the numbers or create intermediate values.

60 + 38 - 49 = 98 - 49 = 49 (No)

Let's try subtraction from a larger number.
? - 14 = 73 => ? = 87. Can I make 87 from 60, 38, 49?
60 + 38 - 49 = 98 - 49 = 49 (No)
60 + 49 - 38 = 109 - 38 = 71 (No)

? - 38 = 73 => ? = 111. Can I make 111 from 14, 60, 49?
60 + 49 + 14 = 123 (No)
(60 * ?) ... too large.

? - 49 = 73 => ? = 122. Can I make 122 from 14, 60, 38?
60 + 38 + 14 = 112 (No)

? - 60 = 73 => ? = 133. Can I make 133 from 14, 38, 49?
49 + 38 + 14 = 101 (No)

Let's try division.
Maybe one of the numbers can be divided by another to get a useful integer.
60 / 14 (no)
60 / 38 (no)
60 / 49 (no)
14 / ? (no)
38 / ? (no)
49 / ? (no)

What if we use multiplication to create a larger number and then subtract?

(14 * 49) = 686

3542,1,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 63, 95, and 96 to reach the target number 64. Each number must be used exactly once, and only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are allowed.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  **Start with the largest number (96):**
    *   96 - ? = 64. This means ? = 32. Can we get 32 from 63 and 95?
        *   95 - 63 = 32. Yes!
        *   So, 96 - (95 - 63) = 96 - 32 = 64.
        *   This uses 96, 95, and 63 exactly once.
        *   The operations are subtraction.
        *   The result is 64.

Let's double-check this equation:
96 - (95 - 63)
= 96 - 32
= 64

This looks correct and meets all the criteria.

Let's try another approach just to be sure or to see if there are other solutions.

2.  **Try multiplication/division first:**
    *   Can we get close to 64 by multiplying or dividing?
    *   63 * 95 is too large.
    *   63 / 95 is a fraction.
    *   95 / 63 is a fraction.
    *   96 / 63 is a fraction.
    *   96 / 95 is close to 1.
    *   63 * 96 is too large.
    *   63 * 95 is too large.

3.  **Try adding first:**
    *   63 + 95 = 158. 158 - 96 = 62. Not 64.
    *   63 + 96 = 159. 159 - 95 = 64. Yes!
    *   So, (63 + 96) - 95 = 159 - 95 = 64.
    *   This uses 63, 96, and 95 exactly once.
    *   The operations are addition and subtraction.
    *   The result is 64.

Let's double-check this second equation:
(63 + 96) - 95
= 159 - 95
= 64

The first solution found, 96 - (95 - 63), is valid.
The second solution found, (63 + 96) - 95, is also valid.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 63, 75, and 2, each exactly once, to equal 87. I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: 63, 75, 2.
The target is 87.

I need to combine these three numbers.
Possible combinations of operations:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try some combinations:

Try starting with the largest number, 75.
How can I get from 75 to 87 using 63 and 2?
87 - 75 = 12. Can I make 12 from 63 and 2?
63 / 2 is not an integer.
63 - 2 = 61 (too large)
63 + 2 = 65 (too large)
63 * 2 = 126 (too large)

What if 75 is not the first number?
Let's try combining 63 and 2 first.
63 + 2 = 65. Then 65 op 75 = 87?
65 + 75 = 140 (too large)
75 - 65 = 10 (too small)
65 - 75 = -10 (too small)
65 * 75 (too large)
75 / 65 (not integer)

63 - 2 = 61. Then 61 op 75 = 87?
61 + 75 = 136 (too large)
75 - 61 = 14 (too small)
61 - 75 = -14 (too small)

63 * 2 = 126. Then 126 op 75 = 87?
126 - 75 = 51 (too small)
75 - 126 = -51 (too small)
126 + 75 (too large)

63 / 2 (not integer)

Let's try combining 75 and 2 first.
75 + 2 = 77. Then 77 op 63 = 87?
77 + 63 = 140 (too large)
63 - 77 = -14 (too small)
77 - 63 = 14 (too small)

75 - 2 = 73. Then 73 op 63 = 87?
73 + 63 = 136 (too large)
63 - 73 = -10 (too small)
73 - 63 = 10 (too small)

75 * 2 = 150. Then 150 op 63 = 87?
150 - 63 = 87. This works!
The numbers are 75, 2, and 63.
The operations are * and -.
The equation is (75 * 2) - 63 = 150 - 63 = 87.
This uses each number once and only standard operations.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities.
What if 63 is involved in a division?
If 63 is the dividend, the divisor must be a factor of 63 (1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 63).
The available numbers are 75 and 2. Neither is a factor of 63. So 63 cannot be the dividend in a division with 75 or 2 as the divisor.

What if 75 is involved in a division?
If 75 is the dividend, the divisor must be a factor of 75 (1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75).
The available numbers are 63 and 2. Neither is a factor of 75. So 75 cannot be the dividend in a division with 63 or 2 as the divisor.

What if 2 is involved in a division?
If 2 is the dividend, the divisor must be a factor of 2 (1, 2).
The available numbers are 63 and 75. Neither is 1 or 2. So 2 cannot be the dividend.

This implies that division is unlikely to be the primary operation leading to the result, or it's part of a larger expression where the intermediate result is divisible.

Let's re-examine the successful one: (75 * 2) - 63 = 87.
This is a valid solution.

Could there be another?
Let's try starting with 63.
63 + ? = 87. Need 24. Can I make 24 from 75 and 2?
75 - 2 = 73 (no)
75 / 2 (no)
75 * 2 = 150 (no)
2 - 75 = -73 (no)

63 - ? = 87. Need -24. Can I make -24 from 75 and 2?
2 - 75 = -73 (no)
75 - 2 = 73 (no)

? - 63 = 87. Need 150. Can I make 150 from 75 and 2?
75 * 2 = 150. Yes.
So, (75 * 2) - 63 = 87. This is the same solution.

Let's try starting with 2.
2 + ? = 87. Need 85. Can I make 85 from 63 and 75?
75 + 63 = 138 (no)
75 - 63 = 12 (no)
63 - 75 = -12 (no)
63 * 75 (too large)

2 - ? = 87. Need -85. Can I make -85 from 63 and 75?
63 - 75 = -12 (no)
75 - 63 = 12 (no)

? - 2 = 87. Need 89. Can I make 89 from 63 and 75?
63 + 75 = 138 (no)
75 - 63 = 12 (no)

It seems (75 * 2) - 63 = 87 is the most straightforward and likely solution.
I should present it in the requested format.

<answer>(75 * 2) - 63 = 87</answer>",1.0,
5743,363,"<think>The given numbers are [72, 55, 15, 30] and the target is 82.
I need to use each number exactly once with basic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possible combinations and operations:
- Start with the largest number, 72.
  - 72 + something = 82. The difference is 10. Can I make 10 from [55, 15, 30]?
    - 55 - 15 - 30 = 40 - 30 = 10. This works!
    - So, 72 + (55 - 15 - 30) = 72 + 10 = 82.
    - This uses all numbers [72, 55, 15, 30] exactly once.
    - The operations are +, -, -.

Let's verify this.
72 + (55 - 15 - 30)
= 72 + (40 - 30)
= 72 + 10
= 82

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure or to explore alternatives.
- What if I try multiplication?
  - 72 * ... unlikely to get 82.
  - 55 * ... unlikely.
  - 15 * ... unlikely.
  - 30 * ... unlikely.

- What about division?
  - 72 / 15? Not an integer.
  - 72 / 30? Not an integer.
  - 55 / 15? Not an integer.
  - 55 / 30? Not an integer.
  - 15 / 30? 0.5.

Let's go back to addition and subtraction.
- Try starting with 55.
  - 55 + 30 = 85. Need to subtract 3. Can I make 3 from [72, 15]?
    - 72 / 15 is not integer.
    - 72 - 15 = 57.
    - 15 - 72 = -57.
    - 72 + 15 = 87.
    - No, cannot make 3.

  - 55 + 15 = 70. Need to add 12. Can I make 12 from [72, 30]?
    - 72 - 30 = 42.
    - 30 - 72 = -42.
    - 72 / 30 is not integer.
    - 30 / 72 is not integer.
    - No, cannot make 12.

  - 55 + 72 = 127. Need to subtract 45. Can I make 45 from [15, 30]?
    - 15 + 30 = 45. This works!
    - So, 55 + 72 - (15 + 30) = 127 - 45 = 82.
    - This uses all numbers [55, 72, 15, 30] exactly once.
    - The operations are +, -, +.

Let's verify this second solution.
55 + 72 - (15 + 30)
= 127 - 45
= 82

This is also a valid solution. The problem asks for *an* arithmetic equation. The first one found is simpler in terms of parenthesis.

Let's check the first solution again: 72 + (55 - 15 - 30).
Numbers used: 72, 55, 15, 30. All used once.
Operations: +, -, -. Basic operations.
Result: 82.

Let's check the second solution: 55 + 72 - (15 + 30).
Numbers used: 55, 72, 15, 30. All used once.
Operations: +, -, +. Basic operations.
Result: 82.

Both are valid. I will present the first one as it's slightly more direct.
72 + (55 - 15 - 30)
The order of operations is important. Parentheses ensure 55 - 15 - 30 is calculated first.
55 - 15 = 40
40 - 30 = 10
72 + 10 = 82.

Another way to write the first solution without explicit parentheses if order of operations is followed:
72 + 55 - 15 - 30
= 127 - 15 - 30
= 112 - 30
= 82
This also works and uses all numbers and basic operations.

Let's consider the second solution without explicit parentheses:
55 + 72 - 15 - 30
= 127 - 15 - 30
= 112 - 30
= 82
This is the same as the previous one.

What about 72 - 15 + 55 - 30?
= 57 + 55 - 30
= 112 - 30
= 82
This also works.

What about 72 - 30 + 55 - 15?
= 42 + 55 - 15
= 97 - 15
= 82
This also works.

The simplest form without unnecessary parentheses would be preferred.
72 + 55 - 15 - 30 = 82
This uses all numbers and basic operations.

Let's try to use multiplication or division.
Can I get 82 by multiplying two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others?
72 * ... no.
55 * ... no.
15 * ... no.
30 * ... no.

Can I get 82 by dividing two numbers and then adding/subtracting the others?
72 / 15 (not integer)
72 / 30 (not integer)
55 / 15 (not integer)
55 / 30 (not integer)
15 / 30 = 0.5.
If I use 15/30 = 0.5, then I have [72, 55, 0.5] and need to get 82.
72 + 55 + 0.5 = 127.5 (too high)
72 + 55 - 0.5 = 126.5 (too high)
72 - 55 + 0.5 = 17.5 (too low)
55 - 72 + 0.5 = -16.5 (too low)

Let's try another structure.
(72 / x) + y + z = 82
(72 / 15) ... not integer.
(72 / 30) ... not integer.

(55 / x) + y + z = 82
(55 / 15) ... not integer.
(55 / 30) ... not integer.

(15 / x) + y + z = 82
(15 / 30) = 0.5. Then 72 + 55 + 0.5 = 127.5.

(30 / x) + y + z = 82
(30 / 15) = 2.
So we have [72, 55, 2]. Need to get 82.
72 + 55 + 2 = 129.
72 + 55 - 2 = 125.
72 - 55 + 2 = 19.
55 - 72 + 2 = -15.
This doesn't work.

Let's try multiplication with one number.
(72 * x) + y + z = 82
(72 * 15) ... too big.
(72 * 30) ... too big.

(55 * x) + y + z = 82
(55 * 15) ... too big.
(55 * 30) ... too big.

(15 * x) + y + z = 82
(15 * 72) ... too big.
(15 * 55) ... too big.
(15 * 30) = 450. Too big.

3463,1388,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 52, 4, 38, and 95 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to form an equation that equals 20.

Let's list the numbers: {52, 4, 38, 95}.
The target value is 20.

We need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. The order of operations matters, so we can use parentheses.

Let's try some combinations.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
Maybe 95 and 52 are involved in subtraction or division.
95 - 52 = 43. We need to get from 43 to 20 using 4 and 38.
43 + 4 + 38 = 85 (too large)
43 - 4 - 38 = 1 (close, but not 20)
43 + 4 - 38 = 9 (not 20)
43 - 4 + 38 = 77 (too large)
43 * 4 = 172 (too large)
43 / 4 (not an integer)
43 + 38 = 77. Need to get from 77 to 20 using 4. 77 - 4 = 73. 77 / 4 (not integer).
43 - 38 = 5. Need to get from 5 to 20 using 4. 5 * 4 = 20. This looks promising!
So, (95 - 52) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20.
We have used 95, 52, and 4. We still need to use 38.
The current equation is (95 - 52) * 4 = 20.
We need to incorporate 38 without changing the result of 20.
This means 38 must be added or subtracted in a way that it cancels out, or multiplied/divided by zero, or added/subtracted to zero.
If we add 38 and then subtract 38, it cancels out.
So, ((95 - 52) * 4) + 38 - 38 = 20.
This uses all numbers: 95, 52, 4, 38.
Let's check:
(95 - 52) = 43
43 * 4 = 172
172 + 38 = 210
210 - 38 = 172. This is not 20.

My mistake was in assuming the 38 could be added/subtracted at the end. The equation must evaluate to 20 *using all numbers*.

Let's re-evaluate the (95 - 52) * 4 = 20 idea.
We used 95, 52, 4. We need to use 38.
The equation is (95 - 52) * 4. The result is 20.
We need to insert 38 into this expression.
If we do (95 - 52) * 4 + 38, it's 20 + 38 = 58.
If we do (95 - 52) * 4 - 38, it's 20 - 38 = -18.
If we do (95 - 52) * (4 + 38), it's 5 * 42 = 210.
If we do (95 - 52) * (4 - 38), it's 5 * (-34) = -170.
If we do (95 - 52) * (4 * 38), it's 5 * 152 = 760.
If we do (95 - 52) * (4 / 38), it's 5 * (2/19) = 10/19.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe division is involved early on.
52 / 4 = 13.
We have {13, 38, 95}. Target 20.
13 + 38 = 51. Need to get from 51 to 20 using 95. 51 - 95 = -44. 95 - 51 = 44.
13 - 38 = -25. Need to get from -25 to 20 using 95. -25 + 95 = 70. 95 - (-25) = 120.
13 * 38 = 494. Too large.
13 + 95 = 108. Need to get from 108 to 20 using 38. 108 - 38 = 70.
13 - 95 = -82. Need to get from -82 to 20 using 38. -82 + 38 = -44.
13 * 95 = 1235. Too large.

Let's try 38 / 4 (not integer).
Let's try 95 / 5 (not available).
Let's try 95 / 4 (not integer).
Let's try 52 / 38 (not integer).
Let's try 38 / 52 (not integer).
Let's try 4 / 52 (not integer).
Let's try 4 / 38 (not integer).
Let's try 4 / 95 (not integer).

What if we use multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract?
95 * 4 = 380.
We have {380, 52, 38}. Target 20.
380 - 52 = 328. Need to get from 328 to 20 using 38. 328 - 38 = 290.
380 - 38 = 342. Need to get from 342 to 20 using 52. 342 - 52 = 290.
380 + 52 = 432. Need to get from 432 to 20 using 38. 432 - 38 = 394.
380 + 38 = 418. Need to get from 418 to 20 using 52. 418 - 52 = 366.

Let's try 52 * 4 = 208.
We have {208, 38, 95}. Target 20.
208 - 95 = 113. Need to get from 113 to 20 using 38. 113 - 38 = 75.
208 - 38 = 170. Need to get from 170 to 20 using 95. 170 - 95 = 75.

Let's try 38 * 4 = 152.
We have {152, 52, 95}. Target 20.
152 - 95 = 57. Need to get from 57 to 20 using 52. 57 - 52 = 5.
152 - 52 = 100. Need to get from 100 to 20 using 95. 100 - 95 = 5.

Let's try 95 - 38 = 57.
We have {57, 52, 4}. Target 20.
57 - 52 = 5. Need to get from 5 to 20 using 4. 5 * 4 = 20.
This looks like a solution!
The expression is (95 - 38) - 52. This gives 5.
Then we need to use 4 to get 20.
So, ((95 - 38) - 52) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20.
Let's check the numbers used: 95, 38, 52, 4. All used exactly once.

The problem asks me to find an equation using the numbers [74, 4, 75, 38] exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target value of 35.

Let's list the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 74, 4, 75, 38
Target: 35
Allowed operations: +, -, *, /

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations to get 35. I can use parentheses to control the order of operations.

Let's try some combinations. The numbers are relatively large, so division might be useful to reduce them, or multiplication might be used to get closer to the target.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest numbers.
(75 - 74) = 1. Then I have 1, 4, 38. Target 35.
1 * 4 = 4. Then I have 4, 38. Target 35. 38 - 4 = 34. Close, but not 35.
1 + 4 = 5. Then I have 5, 38. Target 35. 38 - 5 = 33. Close.
1 / 4 is a fraction, probably not helpful unless it cancels out later.

Let's try another grouping with 75 and 74.
75 / ? or 74 / ?
75 / 3 = 25 (but 3 is not available)
74 / 2 = 37 (but 2 is not available)
74 / 4 = 18.5 (fraction)
75 / 4 = 18.75 (fraction)

Let's try combining 75 and 38.
75 - 38 = 37. Numbers left: 74, 4. Target 35.
37 + 74 + 4 = too large.
37 - 74 - 4 = negative.
37 + 74 - 4 = 107.
37 - 74 + 4 = -33.
37 * 4 = 148. Then 148 and 74. 148 - 74 = 74.
37 * 74 = too large.
37 / 4 = fraction.
37 / 74 = 0.5. Then 0.5 and 4. 0.5 * 4 = 2. Not 35.

Let's try combining 74 and 38.
74 - 38 = 36. Numbers left: 75, 4. Target 35.
36 + 75 + 4 = too large.
36 - 75 + 4 = -35. Close! But I need +35.
36 + 75 - 4 = 107.
36 - 75 - 4 = -43.
36 * 4 = 144. Then 144 and 75. 144 - 75 = 69.
36 / 4 = 9. Numbers left: 75, 9. Target 35.
9 + 75 = 84.
9 - 75 = -66.
75 - 9 = 66.
9 * 75 = too large.

Let's try combining 74 and 4.
74 - 4 = 70. Numbers left: 75, 38. Target 35.
70 - 75 + 38 = 33. Close.
70 + 75 - 38 = 107.
70 - 38 = 32. Then 32 and 75. 75 - 32 = 43.
70 + 38 = 108. Then 108 and 75. 108 - 75 = 33. Close.
70 * 38 = too large.
70 / 38 = fraction.

74 + 4 = 78. Numbers left: 75, 38. Target 35.
78 - 75 + 38 = 41.
78 + 75 - 38 = 115.
78 - 38 = 40. Then 40 and 75. 75 - 40 = 35. Found one!
Let's check the numbers used: 74, 4, 38, 75. All used once.
The expression is (74 + 4) - 38 = 40. Then 75 - 40 = 35.
So, the expression is 75 - ((74 + 4) - 38).
Let's verify:
(74 + 4) = 78
78 - 38 = 40
75 - 40 = 35.
This works.

Let's try another path to confirm or find alternatives.
What if we use division to get smaller numbers early?
74 / ?
75 / ?
38 / ?
4 / ?

Let's try dividing 74 by 4.
74 / 4 = 18.5. Numbers left: 75, 38. Target 35.
18.5 + 75 + 38 = too large.
18.5 - 75 + 38 = -18.5.
18.5 + 75 - 38 = 55.5.
18.5 - 38 = -19.5. Then -19.5 and 75. 75 - (-19.5) = 94.5.
18.5 * 38 = 703. Too large.

Let's try dividing 75 by 3 (not available).
Let's try dividing 38 by 4.
38 / 4 = 9.5. Numbers left: 74, 75. Target 35.
9.5 + 74 + 75 = too large.
9.5 - 74 + 75 = 10.5.
9.5 + 74 - 75 = 4.5.
9.5 - 75 = -65.5. Then -65.5 and 74. 74 - (-65.5) = 139.5.
9.5 * 74 = 703. Too large.

Let's try dividing 74 by 38.
74 / 38 = 1.947... (fraction)

Let's try dividing 75 by 38.
75 / 38 = 1.97... (fraction)

Let's try dividing 75 by 4.
75 / 4 = 18.75. Numbers left: 74, 38. Target 35.
18.75 + 74 + 38 = too large.
18.75 - 74 + 38 = -17.25.
18.75 + 74 - 38 = 54.75.
18.75 - 38 = -19.25. Then -19.25 and 74. 74 - (-19.25) = 93.25.

Let's consider multiplication.
4 * 38 = 152. Numbers left: 74, 75. Target 35.
152 - 74 - 75 = 3. Close.
152 - 75 - 74 = 3.
152 + 74 - 75 = 151.
152 - 74 + 75 = 153.

4 * 74 = 296. Numbers left: 75, 38. Target 35.
296 - 75 - 38 = 183.

4 * 75 = 300. Numbers left: 74, 38. Target 35.
300 - 74 - 38 = 188.

38 * 75 = too large.
38 * 74 = too large.

Let's go back to the successful attempt: 75 - ((74 + 4) - 38) = 35.

The problem requires me to use the numbers 18, 61, and 69 exactly once, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to arrive at the target value of 26.

Let's list the numbers: {18, 61, 69}.
Target value: 26.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations. There are 3 numbers, so there will be 2 operations. The order of operations matters, and the grouping of numbers also matters.

Possible structures:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's try different combinations.

**Attempt 1: Start with 69 and 18**
*   69 - 18 = 51. Now I need to use 61 to get 26.
    *   51 + 61 = 112 (Too high)
    *   51 - 61 = -10 (Too low)
    *   51 * 61 (Too high)
    *   51 / 61 (Fraction, unlikely to lead to 26 easily)
*   69 + 18 = 87. Now use 61.
    *   87 + 61 = 148 (Too high)
    *   87 - 61 = 26. This looks promising!
        *   The equation would be (69 + 18) - 61 = 26.
        *   Let's check: 69 + 18 = 87. 87 - 61 = 26.
        *   Numbers used: 69, 18, 61 (all used once).
        *   Operations used: +, - (basic arithmetic).
        *   Result: 26 (correct).
        *   This seems like a valid solution.

Let's continue exploring just to be thorough and ensure there aren't other simple solutions or to confirm this is the most straightforward.

**Attempt 2: Start with 61 and 18**
*   61 - 18 = 43. Use 69.
    *   43 + 69 = 112 (Too high)
    *   43 - 69 = -26 (Close, but negative)
    *   43 * 69 (Too high)
    *   43 / 69 (Fraction)
*   61 + 18 = 79. Use 69.
    *   79 + 69 = 148 (Too high)
    *   79 - 69 = 10 (Too low)
    *   79 * 69 (Too high)
    *   79 / 69 (Fraction)
*   61 * 18 = 1098. Use 69. (Too high)
*   61 / 18 (Fraction)

**Attempt 3: Start with 69 and 61**
*   69 - 61 = 8. Use 18.
    *   8 + 18 = 26. This is another potential solution!
        *   The equation would be (69 - 61) + 18 = 26.
        *   Let's check: 69 - 61 = 8. 8 + 18 = 26.
        *   Numbers used: 69, 61, 18 (all used once).
        *   Operations used: -, + (basic arithmetic).
        *   Result: 26 (correct).
        *   This is also a valid solution.

*   69 + 61 = 130. Use 18.
    *   130 - 18 = 112 (Too high)
    *   130 + 18 = 148 (Too high)
    *   130 / 18 (Fraction)
*   69 * 61 (Too high)
*   69 / 61 (Fraction)

**Attempt 4: Using division**
Let's consider if division could be involved.
If we have a large number divided by a smaller one, it might reduce it.
For example, if we could make a number like 52 and divide by 2. But we don't have a 2.

Let's re-examine the two solutions found:
1. (69 + 18) - 61 = 26
2. (69 - 61) + 18 = 26

Both are valid. The problem asks for ""a precise mathematical equation"". Either one will suffice. I'll pick the first one I found.

**Self-check for (69 + 18) - 61 = 26:**
*   Numbers used: 69, 18, 61. All are from the set [18 61 69] and each is used exactly once. (Check)
*   Operations used: Addition (+) and Subtraction (-). These are basic arithmetic operations. (Check)
*   Evaluation:
    *   69 + 18 = 87
    *   87 - 61 = 26
    *   The final computed value is 26. (Check)

The equation (69 + 18) - 61 = 26 meets all the criteria.

Let's also check the second solution: (69 - 61) + 18 = 26
*   Numbers used: 69, 61, 18. All are from the set [18 61 69] and each is used exactly once. (Check)
*   Operations used: Subtraction (-) and Addition (+). These are basic arithmetic operations. (Check)
*   Evaluation:
    *   69 - 61 = 8
    *   8 + 18 = 26
    *   The final computed value is 26. (Check)

Both are perfectly valid. I will present the first one found.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 72, 20, and 1 to reach the result 51.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: {72, 20, 1}
Target result: 51

I need to combine these three numbers using the four operations. There are a few possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op b) op c = 51
2. a op (b op c) = 51

Let's try different combinations and see if we can get close to 51.

Possibility 1: Using 72 as the largest number.
- If I subtract from 72: 72 - x = 51, then x must be 21. Can I make 21 from 20 and 1? Yes, 20 + 1 = 21.
So, 72 - (20 + 1) = 72 - 21 = 51.
This uses 72, 20, and 1 exactly once. It uses subtraction and addition. This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.

Possibility 2: Using multiplication.
- Can I multiply two numbers to get something near 51?
  - 72 * 20 = 1440 (too big)
  - 72 * 1 = 72
  - 20 * 1 = 20
- If I use 72 * 1 = 72:
  - 72 op 20 = 51.
    - 72 - 20 = 52 (close!)
    - 72 + 20 = 92
    - 72 / 20 (not an integer)
    - 72 * 20 (too big)
  - If 72 - 20 = 52, I need to adjust by 1. Can I incorporate the '1' to change 52 to 51?
    - (72 * 1) - 20 = 52. How to get 51?
    - (72 - 20) * 1 = 52. How to get 51?
    - 72 - (20 * 1) = 72 - 20 = 52. How to get 51?
    - 72 - 20 - 1 = 51. This uses 72, 20, 1 and subtraction twice. This is also a valid solution.

Let's compare the two solutions found:
Solution A: 72 - (20 + 1) = 51
Solution B: 72 - 20 - 1 = 51

Both are valid. The prompt asks to construct *an* equation. I'll present the first one I found as it's slightly more structured with parentheses.

Let's double-check Solution A:
Numbers used: 72, 20, 1. Each used once.
Operations used: -, +. Allowed.
Result: 72 - (20 + 1) = 72 - 21 = 51. Target achieved.

Let's double-check Solution B:
Numbers used: 72, 20, 1. Each used once.
Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
Result: 72 - 20 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51. Target achieved.

I will go with the first one found: 72 - (20 + 1).

Consider other structures:
- (72 / 20) ... not integer
- (72 * 1) + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92
- (72 * 1) - 20 = 72 - 20 = 52 (close, need to adjust by 1)
  - (72 * 1) - 20 + 1 = 53
  - (72 * 1) - (20 + 1) = 72 - 21 = 51. This is the same as Solution A.
  - (72 * 1) - (20 - 1) = 72 - 19 = 53
- (20 * 1) + 72 = 20 + 72 = 92
- (20 * 1) - 72 = 20 - 72 = -52
- (72 + 20) - 1 = 92 - 1 = 91
- (72 + 20) * 1 = 92
- (72 - 20) + 1 = 52 + 1 = 53
- (72 - 20) * 1 = 52
- (72 + 1) - 20 = 73 - 20 = 53
- (72 + 1) * 20 = 73 * 20 = 1460
- (72 - 1) - 20 = 71 - 20 = 51. This is Solution B again (72 - 1 - 20 is the same as 72 - 20 - 1 due to commutativity of subtraction if we consider it as adding negative numbers, but the order matters for the calculation steps). Let's write it as (72 - 1) - 20.
  - Numbers used: 72, 1, 20. Each used once.
  - Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
  - Result: (72 - 1) - 20 = 71 - 20 = 51. Target achieved.

So we have:
1. 72 - (20 + 1) = 51
2. 72 - 20 - 1 = 51
3. (72 - 1) - 20 = 51

All are valid. I'll stick with the first one as it was the most direct path.
The reasoning process involved trying to get close to the target number (51) by using the largest number (72) and seeing what operation would be needed to reach 51. This led to needing 21. Then, checking if the remaining numbers (20 and 1) could form 21 using the allowed operations. They could, via addition.

Final check of 72 - (20 + 1) = 51:
Numbers: 72, 20, 1 (used once each)
Operations: -, + (allowed)
Result: 72 - 21 = 51 (correct)

The problem asks for an equation using the numbers 77, 63, 64, and 99, exactly once each, with the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target value of 23.

Let's list the numbers: [77, 63, 64, 99]
Target: 23

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. The order of operations matters, so I'll need to consider parentheses.

Let's try to combine pairs of numbers first and see if any intermediate results look promising.

Possible pairs and operations:
77 + 63 = 140
77 - 63 = 14
77 * 63 = 4851
77 / 63 = not an integer

77 + 64 = 141
77 - 64 = 13
77 * 64 = 4928
77 / 64 = not an integer

77 + 99 = 176
77 - 99 = -22
77 * 99 = 7623
77 / 99 = not an integer

63 + 64 = 127
63 - 64 = -1
63 * 64 = 4032
63 / 64 = not an integer

63 + 99 = 162
63 - 99 = -36
63 * 99 = 6237
63 / 99 = not an integer

64 + 99 = 163
64 - 99 = -35
64 * 99 = 6336
64 / 99 = not an integer

The divisions don't seem to yield integers easily, which might be a problem unless the division is the last step or part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's look for combinations that might get us close to 23.
The numbers are relatively large. To get a small number like 23, I'll likely need subtraction or division to reduce the magnitude.

Consider the differences:
77 - 63 = 14. Remaining numbers: [64, 99]. Can I combine 14 with 64 and 99 to get 23?
14 + 64 + 99 = 177 (too large)
14 + 64 - 99 = 78 - 99 = -21 (close, but negative)
14 - 64 + 99 = -50 + 99 = 49 (too large)
14 - 64 - 99 = -50 - 99 = -149 (too small)
14 * 64 + 99 = 896 + 99 = 995 (too large)
14 * 64 - 99 = 896 - 99 = 797 (too large)
14 + 99 - 64 = 113 - 64 = 49 (too large)
14 - 99 + 64 = -85 + 64 = -21 (same as above)

77 - 64 = 13. Remaining numbers: [63, 99]. Can I combine 13 with 63 and 99 to get 23?
13 + 63 + 99 = 175 (too large)
13 + 63 - 99 = 76 - 99 = -23 (close, but negative)
13 - 63 + 99 = -50 + 99 = 49 (too large)
13 - 63 - 99 = -50 - 99 = -149 (too small)
13 + 99 - 63 = 112 - 63 = 49 (too large)
13 - 99 + 63 = -86 + 63 = -23 (same as above)

This -23 is interesting. If I can get 23, then -23 is just a sign change away.
Let's re-examine 13 + 63 - 99 = -23. The numbers used are 77, 64 (to get 13), 63, 99.
The expression is (77 - 64) + 63 - 99 = 13 + 63 - 99 = 76 - 99 = -23.
This uses all numbers. How to get 23 instead of -23?
Maybe change the order of subtraction?
(77 - 64) - (99 - 63) = 13 - 36 = -23.
(77 - 64) + (99 - 63) = 13 + 36 = 49.
(99 - 63) - (77 - 64) = 36 - 13 = 23.
This looks like a solution!
Let's check:
Numbers used: 99, 63, 77, 64. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -, -. Allowed.
Result: (99 - 63) - (77 - 64) = 36 - 13 = 23.

Let's verify the order of operations and parentheses.
(99 - 63) calculates 36.
(77 - 64) calculates 13.
Then 36 - 13 calculates 23.
This is a valid equation.

Let's try another path to be sure.
What if I use multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract?
77 * 63 = 4851 (too big)
77 * 64 = 4928 (too big)
77 * 99 = 7623 (too big)
63 * 64 = 4032 (too big)
63 * 99 = 6237 (too big)
64 * 99 = 6336 (too big)

What about smaller multiplications?
Maybe a number divided by another, then multiplied?
77 / ?
63 / ?
64 / ?
99 / ?

Let's consider division that results in an integer.
77 is divisible by 7, 11.
63 is divisible by 3, 7, 9, 21.
64 is divisible by 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.
99 is divisible by 3, 9, 11, 33.

Can I form a divisor from the other numbers?
For example, can I divide 77 by something formed from [63, 64, 99]?
Or divide 63 by something from [77, 64, 99]?

Let's try to get a number close to 23 by division.
If the last operation is division, say X / Y = 23.
X could be 23 * Y.
If Y = 1, X = 23.
If Y = 2, X = 46.
If Y = 3, X = 69.
If Y = 4, X = 92.
If Y = 5, X = 115.

Let's see if we can form 23 or a multiple of 23.
We found (99 - 63) - (77 - 64) = 36 - 13 = 23. This is a good solution.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be thorough.
What if we try to make a number that, when added/subtracted from another, gives 23?
Example: 99 - X = 23 => X = 76. Can we make 76 from [77, 63, 64]?
77 - 63 + 64 = 14 + 64 = 78 (close)
77 + 63 - 64 = 140 - 64 = 76.
So, 99 - (77 + 63 - 64) = 99 - (140 - 64) = 99 - 76 = 23.
Let's check this:
Numbers used: 99, 77, 63, 64. All used exactly once.

756,1265,"<think>The user wants an arithmetic equation using the numbers 23, 73, and 11 exactly once, resulting in 85. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's list the numbers: 23, 73, 11.
Target value: 85.

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations. I'll try different combinations and see if I can get close to 85.

Possible combinations of two numbers first:
1. 23 + 73 = 96. Then use 11. 96 - 11 = 85. This looks promising.
2. 23 - 73 = -50. Then use 11. -50 + 11 = -39. -50 - 11 = -61. -50 * 11 = -550. -50 / 11 (not an integer).
3. 73 - 23 = 50. Then use 11. 50 + 11 = 61. 50 - 11 = 39. 50 * 11 = 550. 50 / 11 (not an integer).
4. 23 * 73 = 1679. Then use 11. 1679 + 11 = 1690. 1679 - 11 = 1668. 1679 / 11 (not an integer).
5. 73 / 23 (not an integer).
6. 23 / 73 (not an integer).

Now let's consider combinations involving 11 first.
1. 23 + 11 = 34. Then use 73. 34 + 73 = 107. 34 - 73 = -39. 73 - 34 = 39. 34 * 73 = 2482.
2. 23 - 11 = 12. Then use 73. 12 + 73 = 85. This is another solution!
3. 11 - 23 = -12. Then use 73. -12 + 73 = 61. 73 - (-12) = 85. This is also a solution!
4. 23 * 11 = 253. Then use 73. 253 + 73 = 326. 253 - 73 = 180. 73 - 253 = -180.
5. 23 / 11 (not an integer).
6. 11 / 23 (not an integer).

7. 73 + 11 = 84. Then use 23. 84 + 23 = 107. 84 - 23 = 61. 23 - 84 = -61. 84 * 23 = 1932.
8. 73 - 11 = 62. Then use 23. 62 + 23 = 85. This is another solution!
9. 11 - 73 = -62. Then use 23. -62 + 23 = -39. 23 - (-62) = 85. This is also a solution!
10. 73 * 11 = 803. Then use 23. 803 + 23 = 826. 803 - 23 = 780. 23 - 803 = -780.
11. 73 / 11 (not an integer).
12. 11 / 73 (not an integer).

Let's re-examine the promising ones:
- (23 + 73) - 11 = 96 - 11 = 85. This uses 23, 73, 11 once.
- (23 - 11) + 73 = 12 + 73 = 85. This uses 23, 11, 73 once.
- 73 - (23 - 11) = 73 - 12 = 61. No.
- 73 + (23 - 11) = 73 + 12 = 85. This uses 73, 23, 11 once.
- 73 - (11 - 23) = 73 - (-12) = 73 + 12 = 85. This uses 73, 11, 23 once.
- (73 - 11) + 23 = 62 + 23 = 85. This uses 73, 11, 23 once.
- 23 + (73 - 11) = 23 + 62 = 85. This uses 23, 73, 11 once.
- 23 - (11 - 73) = 23 - (-62) = 23 + 62 = 85. This uses 23, 11, 73 once.

I have found multiple valid solutions. I will pick one of the simpler ones.
(23 + 73) - 11 = 85.
Intermediate calculation: 23 + 73 = 96.
Final calculation: 96 - 11 = 85.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 64, 53, 64, and 66 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to equal 12.

Let's list the numbers: 64, 53, 64, 66.
The target is 12.

This is a constrained problem. The numbers are relatively large, and the target is small. This suggests division or subtraction will be important to reduce the magnitude.

Let's try to combine the two 64s first.
64 + 64 = 128
64 - 64 = 0
64 * 64 = 4096
64 / 64 = 1

Case 1: 64 / 64 = 1.
We are left with 53, 66, and 1. We need to get 12.
Possible combinations with 1, 53, 66:
1 + 53 + 66 = 120 (too large)

If we have 66 - 53 = 13. We are left with 64, 64, and 13. We need to get 12.
Can we use 64, 64 to get something that, combined with 13, gives 12?
We need to get -1 from 64, 64.
64 - 64 = 0 (not -1)
64 / 64 = 1 (not -1)
So, (66 - 53) combined with 64, 64 doesn't seem to work easily.

Let's reconsider the 64 / 64 = 1.
We had 1, 53, 66. We got 13 and -12 and 14.
If we have 13, we need to subtract 1. We have 1, 53, 66.
We got 13 from 66 * 1 - 53. This used 66, 1, 53. The 1 came from 64/64.
So, (66 * (64/64)) - 53 = 66 * 1 - 53 = 66 - 53 = 13.
We used 66, 64, 64, 53. This is all the numbers. The result is 13. We need 12.

What if we try to get 12 directly from some numbers?
Maybe 66 - 53 = 13. We need to subtract 1.
We have 64, 64 left. Can we make 1 from 64, 64? Yes, 64/64 = 1.
So, (66 - 53) - (64 / 64) = 13 - 1 = 12.
This uses 66, 53, 64, 64 exactly once.

First, the parentheses:

Possibility 4: Start with division.
*   21 / 11 (not a whole number, unlikely to lead to 78 easily with integers).
*   21 / 9 (not a whole number).
*   11 / 9 (not a whole number).
*   9 / 21 (not a whole number).
*   11 / 21 (not a whole number).
*   9 / 11 (not a whole number).

The initial approach of trying multiplication first, as it tends to increase numbers quickly, was effective. The combination (11 * 9) - 21 directly yielded the target number.

I must use the numbers 7, 47, 4, and 34 exactly once.
The allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: {7, 47, 4, 34}.
The target value is 82.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four operations to get 82.
I'll try different combinations and see if they lead to the target.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op (c op d)
2. ((a op b) op c) op d
3. (a op (b op c)) op d
4. a op ((b op c) op d)
5. a op (b op (c op d))

Let's start by looking at the larger numbers and how they might interact.
47 and 34 are the largest.
47 + 34 = 81. This is very close to 82.
If I have 47 + 34, I need to get +1 from the remaining numbers (7 and 4).
Can I get 1 from 7 and 4 using +, -, *, /?
7 + 4 = 11
7 - 4 = 3
4 - 7 = -3
7 * 4 = 28
7 / 4 = 1.75 (not an integer, likely not useful unless it cancels out later)
4 / 7 (fraction)

So, 47 + 34 = 81. I need to add 1.
If I use (7 / 4), it's not an integer.
What if I try to get 1 from 7 and 4 in a way that can be added?
(7 - 4) = 3. Not 1.
(4 - 7) = -3. Not 1.
(7 * 4) = 28. Not 1.
(7 / 4) = 1.75.

Let's reconsider 47 + 34 = 81.
If I have 81, I need to add 1.
Can I get 1 from 7 and 4? No simple way.

What if I try to get 82 directly?
Maybe multiplication is involved to increase the numbers.
47 * 4 = 188. Too big.
47 * 34 = very big.
34 * 4 = 136. Too big.
34 * 7 = 238. Too big.
7 * 4 = 28.

Let's try combining 47 and 34 differently.
47 - 34 = 13.
Remaining numbers are 7 and 4.
Can I get 82 from 13, 7, and 4?
13 + 7 + 4 = 24.
13 * 7 = 91. 91 + 4 = 95. 91 - 4 = 87. Close.
13 * 4 = 52. 52 + 7 = 59. 52 - 7 = 45.
13 + (7 * 4) = 13 + 28 = 41.
13 - (7 * 4) = 13 - 28 = -15.
(13 + 7) * 4 = 20 * 4 = 80. Close!
If I have (47 - 34 + 7) * 4 = (13 + 7) * 4 = 20 * 4 = 80.
I need 82. I got 80. I used 47, 34, 7, 4.
This structure is ((a - b) + c) * d.
((47 - 34) + 7) * 4 = 80.

Let's try another structure with 80.
Maybe I can get 2 from the numbers if I rearrange.
What if I try to get 82 from 80 by adding 2?
The numbers used were 47, 34, 7, 4.
The equation was ((47 - 34) + 7) * 4 = 80.
This used all numbers. So I can't add 2.

Let's go back to 47 + 34 = 81.
I need to get +1 from 7 and 4.
What if I use division to get a small number?

The user wants an equation using the numbers 82, 39, 63, and 93 to equal 73.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combining numbers:
- 82 + 39 = 121
- 82 - 39 = 43
- 82 * 39 = 3198
- 82 / 39 (not an integer)

- 63 + 93 = 156
- 63 - 93 = -30
- 63 * 93 = 5859
- 63 / 93 (not an integer)

Let's try combining pairs and then operating on the results.

Try to get close to 73.
Maybe a large number minus something.
93 - ? = 73 -> ? = 20
Can I make 20 from 82, 39, 63?
82 - 63 = 19. Close.
82 - 63 + 39 = 19 + 39 = 58. No.
82 - 39 = 43.
63 - 39 = 24.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D or (A + B) * C / D.

Consider the target 73.
It's a prime number.

Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 73 and subtract.
Or a number slightly smaller and add.

Try using 82 and 39.
82 - 39 = 43.
Remaining numbers are 63 and 93.
Can I make 73 from 43, 63, 93?
43 + 63 = 106. 106 - 93 = 13. No.
43 + 93 = 136. 136 - 63 = 73. Yes!

So the numbers used are 82, 39, 93, 63.
The operations are -, +, -.
The equation is (82 - 39) + 93 - 63.
Let's check:
(82 - 39) = 43
43 + 93 = 136
136 - 63 = 73.

This works. All numbers [82 39 63 93] are used exactly once. Basic operations are used.

Let's write it out clearly.
Numbers: 82, 39, 63, 93
Target: 73

Step 1: Combine 82 and 39 using subtraction.
82 - 39 = 43

Step 2: Combine the result (43) with 93 using addition.
43 + 93 = 136

Step 3: Combine the result (136) with 63 using subtraction.
136 - 63 = 73

The equation is (82 - 39) + 93 - 63 = 73.
This uses all numbers and allowed operations.

Let's try another combination just to be sure.
What if we start with 93?
93 - ? = 73 -> ? = 20.
Can we make 20 from 82, 39, 63?
82 - 63 = 19. Close.
82 - 63 + 39 = 58.
82 - 39 = 43.
63 - 39 = 24.

What if we use multiplication?
Maybe (93 / 3) * ? No, 93 is not divisible by 39 or 82 or 63.

Let's re-check the first solution: (82 - 39) + 93 - 63 = 73.
Numbers used: 82, 39, 93, 63. All used once.
Operations: -, +, -. All basic.
Result: 73. Correct.

The order of operations matters. Parentheses are allowed implicitly by the order of calculation.
(82 - 39) + 93 - 63
43 + 93 - 63
136 - 63
73

Another way to write it without explicit parentheses if we follow standard order of operations:
82 - 39 + 93 - 63
This would be evaluated left to right:
82 - 39 = 43
43 + 93 = 136
136 - 63 = 73
So, 82 - 39 + 93 - 63 = 73 is a valid equation.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe something like 93 + (something).
93 + (82 - 63 - 39) = 93 + (19 - 39) = 93 + (-20) = 73.
This also works.
Numbers used: 93, 82, 63, 39. All used once.
Operations: +, -, -. All basic.
Result: 73. Correct.
Equation: 93 + (82 - 63 - 39) = 73.

Let's check the order of operations for 93 + 82 - 63 - 39.
93 + 82 = 175
175 - 63 = 112
112 - 39 = 73.
So, 93 + 82 - 63 - 39 = 73 is also a valid equation.

The user asked for ""the final equation"". I should pick one.
The first one I found was (82 - 39) + 93 - 63.
The second one was 93 + 82 - 63 - 39.

Both are valid. I'll present the first one as it was derived more directly.
The prompt asks for ""the final equation"". It doesn't specify if parentheses are required or if standard order of operations is assumed.
If I write 82 - 39 + 93 - 63, it evaluates correctly to 73.
If I write 93 + 82 - 63 - 39, it also evaluates correctly to 73.

Let's try to use multiplication or division.
Can we make 73 using multiplication?
Maybe (A * B) / C + D?
(82 * 39) / 63 + 93? No, 82*39 is large.
(82 * 39) / 93 + 63? No.
(63 * 39) / 82 + 93? No.

Let's try division first.
82 / ?
39 / ?
63 / ?
93 / ?
None of the numbers are easily divisible by others to produce useful integers.

Let's stick to the additive/subtractive solutions.
82 - 39 + 93 - 63 = 73
93 + 82 - 63 - 39 = 73

I will present the first one found.
82 - 39 + 93 - 63 = 73.
This uses all numbers [82 39 63 93] exactly once.
It uses only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
It evaluates to 73.

The prompt asks for the equation within <answer></answer> tags.
The equation is 82 - 39 + 93 - 63 = 73.
I should ensure no extra commentary is included.
The intermediate steps are for my thinking process and should not be in the final output.

86 / 19? No.
86 / 13? No.
68 / 19? No.
68 / 13? No.
19 / 13? No.
13 / 19? No.

What if we use division to get smaller numbers?
Maybe something like (A / B) * C + D?

Let's try to get close to 95 with two numbers and then adjust with the other two.
19 * 6 = 114. Can we make 6 from 13, 86, 68? No.
13 * 7 = 91. Can we make 7 from 19, 86, 68? No.
13 * 8 = 104. Can we make 8 from 19, 86, 68? No.

Let's try to get a number slightly larger than 95 and subtract.
19 * 5 = 95. Can we make 5 from 13, 86, 68? No.
13 * 8 = 104. Can we make 8 from 19, 86, 68? No.

Let's try combining three numbers first.
(19 + 13) * X = 32 * X.
(19 - 13) * X = 6 * X.
(19 * 13) + X = 247 + X.
(19 * 13) - X = 247 - X.

Let's try to get a number around 95 using multiplication.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 17, 52, 38, and 47 exactly once, with only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to equal 16.

Let's list the numbers: [17, 52, 38, 47]
Target: 16

I need to try different combinations and operations.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create intermediate results that are close to 16 or can easily lead to 16.

Let's try some combinations:

Try using division to reduce numbers:
- 52 / 17 is not an integer.
- 52 / 38 is not an integer.
- 52 / 47 is not an integer.
- 38 / 17 is not an integer.
- 38 / 52 is not an integer.
- 47 / 17 is not an integer.
- 47 / 52 is not an integer.
- 47 / 38 is not an integer.

This suggests division might not be the primary operation to get an integer result early on, unless it's part of a larger expression that resolves to an integer.

Let's try multiplication:
- 17 * 52 = 884 (too large)
- 17 * 38 = 646 (too large)
- 17 * 47 = 799 (too large)
- 52 * 38 = 1976 (too large)
- 52 * 47 = 2444 (too large)
- 38 * 47 = 1786 (too large)

Multiplication will likely be used to create a larger number that is then reduced by subtraction or division.

Let's try to get close to 16.
Maybe combine two numbers to get something near 16, then use the other two.

Try combining 52 and 38:
- 52 - 38 = 14. Remaining numbers: [17, 47]. Can we get 2 from 17 and 47? 47 - 17 = 30. 17 - 47 = -30. 17 + 47 = 64. 17 * 47 = 799. 47 / 17 is not integer. 17 / 47 is not integer. No easy way to get 2.
- 52 + 38 = 90. Remaining numbers: [17, 47]. Can we get -74 from 17 and 47? No.
- 52 * 38 = 1976. Remaining numbers: [17, 47]. Need to get 16 - 1976 = -1960. No.
- 52 / 38 is not integer.

Try combining 52 and 47:
- 52 - 47 = 5. Remaining numbers: [17, 38]. Can we get 11 from 17 and 38? 38 - 17 = 21. 17 - 38 = -21. 17 + 38 = 55. 17 * 38 = 646. No easy way to get 11.
- 52 + 47 = 99. Remaining numbers: [17, 38]. Need to get 16 - 99 = -83. No.

Try combining 52 and 17:
- 52 - 17 = 35. Remaining numbers: [38, 47]. Can we get 16 - 35 = -19 from 38 and 47? 38 - 47 = -9. 47 - 38 = 9. 38 + 47 = 85. 38 * 47 = 1786. No.
- 52 + 17 = 69. Remaining numbers: [38, 47]. Need 16 - 69 = -53. No.

Try combining 38 and 47:
- 47 - 38 = 9. Remaining numbers: [17, 52]. Can we get 16 - 9 = 7 from 17 and 52? 52 - 17 = 35. 17 - 52 = -35. 17 + 52 = 69. No.
- 38 + 47 = 85. Remaining numbers: [17, 52]. Need 16 - 85 = -69. No.

Let's try to create a number close to 16 using multiplication and then adjust.
Maybe something like (A * B) / C + D = 16 or (A * B) - C - D = 16.

Consider (52 * 38) / X ... too large.
Consider (52 * 17) / X ... too large.

Let's try to make a number slightly larger than 16 and subtract.
Or a number slightly smaller than 16 and add.

What if we use division at the end?
(X) / Y = 16. So X must be a multiple of 16.
Possible X values: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, ...

Let's try to make 80.
Numbers: [17, 52, 38, 47]
Can we make 80 using three numbers, then divide by the fourth to get 16?
If Y = 5, then X = 80. Can we make 5 using one number? No.
If Y = 10, then X = 160.
If Y = 2, then X = 32.

Let's try to make 32.
Numbers: [17, 52, 38, 47]
Can we make 32 using three numbers, then divide by the fourth to get 16?
If Y = 2, then X = 32. Can we make 2 from one number? No.

Let's try to make 48.
Numbers: [17, 52, 38, 47]
If Y = 3, then X = 48. Can we make 3 from one number? No.

Let's try to make 64.
Numbers: [17, 52, 38, 47]
If Y = 4, then X = 64. Can we make 4 from one number? No.

Let's try to make 96.
Numbers: [17, 52, 38, 47]
If Y = 6, then X = 96. Can we make 6 from one number? No.

What if the division is not the last step?
Example: A + B / C * D = 16

Let's try to get a number close to 16 by adding/subtracting.
52 - 38 = 14. Need +2 from 17 and 47. No.
47 - 38 = 9. Need +7 from 17 and 52. No.
52 - 17 = 35. Need -19 from 38 and 47. No.

Let's try to use multiplication to get a number that, when combined with others, results in 16.
Consider 17 * X.
17 * 1 = 17. Need -1 from [52, 38, 47]. No.
17 * 2 = 34. Need 16 - 34 = -18 from [52, 38, 47]. No.

Consider 38 * X.
38 * 1 = 38. Need 16 - 38 = -22 from [17, 52, 47]. No.

Consider 47 * X.
47 * 1 = 47. Need 16 - 47 = -31 from [17, 52, 38]. No.

The user wants an arithmetic expression using the numbers [46, 80, 11, 62] that evaluates to 53.
I can only use the four basic operations: +, -, *, /.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 46, 80, 11, 62.
Target: 53.

I need to combine these four numbers using the allowed operations. I can try different combinations and see if I get close to 53.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create numbers close to 53 by combining two numbers first.
3. Consider division as it can significantly change the magnitude.

Let's try combining pairs:
- 80 + 62 = 142
- 80 - 62 = 18
- 80 * 62 = 4960
- 80 / 62 (not an integer, unlikely to be useful unless combined with multiplication later)

- 46 + 80 = 126
- 46 - 80 = -34
- 46 * 80 = 3680
- 46 / 80 (not integer)

- 62 + 11 = 73
- 62 - 11 = 51 (This is close to 53!)
- 62 * 11 = 682
- 62 / 11 (not integer)

- 46 + 11 = 57 (Close to 53)
- 46 - 11 = 35
- 46 * 11 = 506
- 46 / 11 (not integer)

Let's focus on the 62 - 11 = 51.
We have used 62 and 11. The remaining numbers are 46 and 80.
We need to combine 51 with 46 and 80 to get 53.
So, we need to get 53 from (51, 46, 80).
This means we need to combine 46 and 80 to get a value that, when combined with 51, results in 53.
Let X be the result of combining 46 and 80.
We need 51 op X = 53.
If op is +, then 51 + X = 53, so X = 2. Can we get 2 from 46 and 80?
  - 80 - 46 = 34 (No)
  - 80 / 46 (No)
  - 46 - 80 = -34 (No)
  - 46 / 80 (No)
  - 80 + 46 = 126 (No)
  - 80 * 46 = 3680 (No)

If op is -, then 51 - X = 53, so X = -2. Can we get -2 from 46 and 80? No.
If op is -, then X - 51 = 53, so X = 104. Can we get 104 from 46 and 80?
  - 80 + 46 = 126 (No)
  - 80 * 46 (No)

If op is *, then 51 * X = 53 (No integer X).
If op is /, then 51 / X = 53 (No integer X).
If op is /, then X / 51 = 53, so X = 53 * 51 (Too large).

So, (62 - 11) as the first step doesn't seem to work easily.

Let's try 46 + 11 = 57.
Remaining numbers: 80, 62.
We need to combine 57 with 80 and 62 to get 53.
Let X be the result of combining 80 and 62.
We need 57 op X = 53.
If op is +, 57 + X = 53, X = -4. Can we get -4 from 80 and 62? No.
If op is -, 57 - X = 53, X = 4. Can we get 4 from 80 and 62?
  - 80 - 62 = 18 (No)
  - 62 - 80 = -18 (No)
  - 80 / 62 (No)
  - 62 / 80 (No)
  - 80 + 62 = 142 (No)
  - 80 * 62 (No)
If op is -, X - 57 = 53, X = 110. Can we get 110 from 80 and 62?
  - 80 + 62 = 142 (No)

Let's try combining three numbers first.
Maybe division is key.
80 / 11? Not integer.
80 / 46? Not integer.
80 / 62? Not integer.
62 / 11? Not integer.
62 / 46? Not integer.
46 / 11? Not integer.

What if we create a number that divides nicely?
For example, can we make 10?
80 / (something) = 10? Need 8. Can we make 8 from 46, 11, 62?
  - 62 - 46 - 11 = 16 - 11 = 5 (No)
  - 46 + 11 = 57. 62 - 57 = 5. (No)
  - 62 - 11 = 51. 51 - 46 = 5. (No)

Let's try to get a number close to 53 by multiplication.
11 * 4 = 44 (Need 9 more. Remaining: 80, 62. Can we get 9 from 80, 62? No)
11 * 5 = 55 (Need 2 less. Remaining: 80, 62. Can we get 2 from 80, 62? No)
11 * 6 = 66 (Need 13 less. Remaining: 80, 62. Can we get 13 from 80, 62? No)

Let's try using 80 and 62 to get a smaller number.
80 - 62 = 18. Remaining: 46, 11.
We need to combine 18 with 46 and 11 to get 53.
Let X be the result of combining 46 and 11.
We need 18 op X = 53.
If op is +, 18 + X = 53, X = 35. Can we get 35 from 46 and 11?
  - 46 - 11 = 35. Yes!
So, the expression could be (80 - 62) + (46 - 11).
Let's check:
(80 - 62) = 18
(46 - 11) = 35
18 + 35 = 53.

This looks like a valid solution.
Numbers used: 80, 62, 46, 11. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +, -. All basic operations.
Result: 53.

Let's write it out clearly:
Step 1: Calculate the difference between 80 and 62.
   80 - 62 = 18
Step 2: Calculate the difference between 46 and 11.
   46 - 11 = 35
Step 3: Add the results from Step 1 and Step 2.
   18 + 35 = 53

The expression is (80 - 62) + (46 - 11).

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there's a simpler one.
What about division?
Can we make a number that divides 80 or 62 or 46?
If we can make 2, then 80/2 = 40.
Can we make 2 from 46, 11, 62?

Let's try different combinations:

2.  (55 - 29) + 58 = 26 + 58 = 84 (Not 32)

17. (58 / 29) - 55 = 2 - 55 = -53 (Not 32)

Let's check other combinations involving division that might result in integers or useful fractions.
58 / 29 = 2.
So, we have 55 and 2. We need to get 32.
55 - 2 = 53 (Not 32)
55 + 2 = 57 (Not 32)
2 - 55 = -53 (Not 32)

Let's re-evaluate the successful one: (29 + 58) - 55 = 87 - 55 = 32.
This uses 29, 58, and 55 exactly once with + and -.

Let's try other structures.
What if 55 is involved in division?
55 / ?
55 / 29 is not an integer.
55 / 58 is not an integer.

What if 29 is involved in division?
29 / 55 is not an integer.
29 / 58 is not an integer.

What if 58 is involved in division?
58 / 29 = 2.
We have 55 and 2. We need 32.
55 - 2 = 53
55 + 2 = 57
2 - 55 = -53

Let's try multiplication.
55 * 29 = 1595
55 * 58 = 3190
29 * 58 = 1682

Let's go back to the successful one: (29 + 58) - 55 = 32.
This is a valid solution.

Are there any others?
Consider 55 - (something).
55 - (29 - 58) = 55 - (-29) = 55 + 29 = 84 (No)
55 - (58 - 29) = 55 - 29 = 26 (No)

55 - (58 + 29) = 55 - 87 = -32 (No)
55 - (29 * 58) = 55 - 1682 (No)
55 - (58 / 29) = 55 - 2 = 53 (No)
55 - (29 / 58) (No)

Consider 29 - (something).
29 - (55 - 58) = 29 - (-3) = 29 + 3 = 32.
This uses 29, 55, 58.
29 - (55 - 58) = 29 - (-3) = 32.
This is another valid solution.

Consider 58 - (something).
58 - (55 - 29) = 58 - 26 = 32.
This uses 58, 55, 29.
58 - (55 - 29) = 58 - 26 = 32.

2. 29 - (55 - 58) = 32

Let's list the numbers: 25, 77, 7, 40.
Target: 84.

I need to combine these numbers using the allowed operations. I'll try various combinations and see if I can get close to 84.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with larger numbers and try to adjust.
2. Look for combinations that might produce numbers close to multiples of 84 or factors of 84.
3. Consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

Let's try some initial combinations:

Attempt 1:
(77 + 25) - 7 - 40 = 102 - 7 - 40 = 95 - 40 = 55 (Too low)
(77 - 25) + 7 + 40 = 52 + 7 + 40 = 59 + 40 = 99 (Close, but not 84)
(77 * 7) ... this will be a large number, likely too large. 77 * 7 = 539.
(77 / 7) = 11. Now I have 11, 25, 40. Target 84.
11 + 25 + 40 = 76 (Too low)
11 * 25 = 275 (Too high)
11 * 40 = 440 (Too high)
(25 * 7) = 175. Now I have 175, 77, 40. Target 84. This seems unlikely to work.
(40 * 7) = 280. Now I have 280, 25, 77. Target 84. Unlikely.
(40 / 25) is not an integer.
(77 / 25) is not an integer.
(40 / 7) is not an integer.
(25 / 7) is not an integer.

Let's try combining numbers to get something that, when operated with the remaining numbers, yields 84.

Consider the target 84.
Factors of 84: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84.

Maybe I can create a number that, when multiplied by one of the given numbers, gets close.
For example, if I could make 12, then 12 * 7 = 84.
Can I make 12 from 25, 77, 40?
(40 - 25) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 (No)
(40 + 25) - 77 = 65 - 77 = -12 (No)
(77 - 40) - 25 = 37 - 25 = 12.
So, (77 - 40 - 25) = 12.
Now I have 12 and the number 7.
12 * 7 = 84.
This uses all numbers: 77, 40, 25, 7.
The operations used are subtraction and multiplication.
The equation would be (77 - 40 - 25) * 7.
Let's check:
77 - 40 = 37
37 - 25 = 12
12 * 7 = 84.
This works!

Let's double check the constraints:
- Numbers used: 25, 77, 7, 40 (all used exactly once).
- Operations used: -, -, * (basic operations).
- Result: 84.

This seems to be a valid solution.

Let's consider if there are other possibilities just to be thorough.

What if I try to make 42? Then 42 * 2 = 84. I don't have a 2.
What if I try to make 28? Then 28 * 3 = 84. I don't have a 3.
What if I try to make 21? Then 21 * 4 = 84. I don't have a 4.
What if I try to make 14? Then 14 * 6 = 84. I don't have a 6.

Let's try division.
If I can make a large number and divide.
(77 * 40) / ? ... too large.

Let's revisit the (77 / 7) = 11 idea.
Numbers left: 11, 25, 40. Target 84.
11 + 25 + 40 = 76 (close)
(25 + 40) + 11 = 65 + 11 = 76
(40 - 25) + 11 = 15 + 11 = 26

(40 * 11) - 25 = 440 - 25 = 415
(25 * 40) / 11 ... not integer.

Let's try another approach.
Maybe combine two numbers, then operate with the other two.
(25 + 77) = 102. Remaining: 7, 40. Target 84.
102 - 7 - 40 = 55
102 - (40 - 7) = 102 - 33 = 69
102 - (40 + 7) = 102 - 47 = 55
102 + 7 - 40 = 109 - 40 = 69
102 + 40 - 7 = 142 - 7 = 135

(77 - 25) = 52. Remaining: 7, 40. Target 84.
52 + 7 + 40 = 99
52 + 40 - 7 = 92 - 7 = 85 (Very close!)
52 + 7 - 40 = 59 - 40 = 19
52 - 7 + 40 = 45 + 40 = 85 (Same result)
52 - 40 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19

(25 * 7) = 175. Remaining: 77, 40. Target 84.
175 - 77 - 40 = 98 - 40 = 58
175 - (77 + 40) = 175 - 117 = 58
175 - 77 + 40 = 98 + 40 = 138
175 + 40 - 77 = 215 - 77 = 138

(40 * 7) = 280. Remaining: 25, 77. Target 84.
280 - 77 - 25 = 203 - 25 = 178
280 - (77 + 25) = 280 - 102 = 178

(77 * 40) = 3080. Remaining: 7, 25. Target 84. Unlikely.

(77 + 40) = 117. Remaining: 7, 25. Target 84.
117 - 25 - 7 = 92 - 7 = 85 (Close again!)
117 - (25 + 7) = 117 - 32 = 85
117 - 25 + 7 = 92 + 7 = 99

1670,1700,"<think>The problem asks us to use the numbers 25, 75, 42, and 57 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to achieve a result of 85.

Let's list the numbers: [25, 75, 42, 57].
The target is 85.

We need to combine these four numbers. Let's try different combinations and operations.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if we can adjust.
2. Try to get close to 85 with two numbers and then use the remaining two.
3. Consider the properties of the numbers (e.g., divisibility).

Let's try combining 75 and 25.
75 + 25 = 100. We need to get from 100 to 85 using 42 and 57. 100 - (something) = 85, so something = 15. Can we get 15 from 42 and 57?
57 - 42 = 15.
So, (75 + 25) - (57 - 42) = 100 - 15 = 85.
This uses all numbers [25, 75, 42, 57] exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 75, 25, 57, 42. All are used.
Operations used: +, -, -. All are basic.
Result: 85.

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or just to explore.

What if we start with 75 and 42?
75 + 42 = 117. We need to get from 117 to 85 using 25 and 57. 117 - (something) = 85, so something = 32. Can we get 32 from 25 and 57?
57 - 25 = 32.
So, (75 + 42) - (57 - 25) = 117 - 32 = 85.
This is another valid solution.

What if we start with 75 and 57?
75 + 57 = 132. We need to get from 132 to 85 using 25 and 42. 132 - (something) = 85, so something = 47. Can we get 47 from 25 and 42?
42 + 25 = 67.
42 - 25 = 17.
25 - 42 = -17.
42 * 25 = 1050.
42 / 25 is not an integer.
25 / 42 is not an integer.
So, this path doesn't seem to work easily.

Let's try multiplication.
Maybe 25 * 4 = 100. We don't have 4.
Maybe 75 / 3 = 25. We don't have 3.

Let's go back to the first solution found: (75 + 25) - (57 - 42) = 85.
This is a good candidate.

Let's check the second solution found: (75 + 42) - (57 - 25) = 85.
This is also a good candidate.

The problem asks for ""the final equation"". It doesn't specify which one if multiple exist. I will provide the first one I found.

Let's write it out clearly.
Numbers: 25, 75, 42, 57
Target: 85
Operation 1: 75 + 25 = 100
Operation 2: 57 - 42 = 15
Operation 3: 100 - 15 = 85

Combining these: (75 + 25) - (57 - 42) = 85.

Let's consider the order of operations. Parentheses are allowed implicitly by the structure of the expression.
The expression (75 + 25) - (57 - 42) uses all numbers once and results in 85.

Let's try another structure.
Maybe something like A * B + C - D = 85.
Or A + B * C - D = 85.

Let's try using 75 and 42 in a different way.
75 - 42 = 33. We need to get from 33 to 85 using 25 and 57. 33 + (something) = 85, so something = 52. Can we get 52 from 25 and 57?
57 - 25 = 32.
57 + 25 = 82.
No.

Let's try using 75 and 57 in a different way.
75 - 57 = 18. We need to get from 18 to 85 using 25 and 42. 18 + (something) = 85, so something = 67. Can we get 67 from 25 and 42?
42 + 25 = 67.
So, (75 - 57) + (42 + 25) = 18 + 67 = 85.
This is another valid solution.

Let's try using 42 and 25.
42 + 25 = 67. We need to get from 67 to 85 using 75 and 57. 67 + (something) = 85, so something = 18. Can we get 18 from 75 and 57?
75 - 57 = 18.
So, (42 + 25) + (75 - 57) = 67 + 18 = 85.
This is the same as the previous one, just reordered.

42 - 25 = 17. We need to get from 17 to 85 using 75 and 57. 17 + (something) = 85, so something = 68. Can we get 68 from 75 and 57?
75 - 57 = 18.
75 + 57 = 132.
No.

Let's try multiplication again.
What if we try to get a number close to 85 by multiplying two numbers?
25 * 42 = 1050 (too big)
25 * 57 = 1425 (too big)
25 * 75 = 1875 (too big)
42 * 57 (too big)
42 * 75 (too big)
57 * 75 (too big)

What about division?
75 / 25 = 3. We need to get from 3 to 85 using 42 and 57. 3 + (something) = 85, so something = 82. Can we get 82 from 42 and 57?
57 + 42 = 99.
57 - 42 = 15.
No.

Let's consider the structure A * (B + C) - D = 85 or similar.
Let's try to get a number that, when multiplied by one of the numbers, gets us close.
For example, if we multiply by 25, we need something around 85/25 = 3.4.
Can we get 3.4 from 75, 42, 57? Unlikely with integers.

Let's revisit the additive/subtractive solutions.
We found:
1. (75 + 25) - (57 - 42) = 85
2. (75 + 42) - (57 - 25) = 85
3. (75 - 57) + (42 + 25) = 85

All are valid. The problem asks for ""the final equation"". I will pick the first one found.
(75 + 25) - (57 - 42) = 85

Let's double check the constraints:
- Use all numbers from [25 75 42 57] exactly once. (Yes: 75, 25, 57, 42)
- Resulting in 85. (Yes: 100 - 15 =",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.
788,397,"<think>The user wants me to find an arithmetic expression using the numbers [70, 52, 13, 63] and the operators [+,-,*,/] to reach the target sum of 11. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 70, 52, 13, 63.
Target: 11.

I need to try different combinations of operators and parentheses.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can reduce them.
2. Try to create small numbers first.
3. Look for divisions that result in integers.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(70 / ?) ... 70 is not easily divisible by 52, 13, or 63 to get a useful integer.
(52 / ?) ... 52 / 13 = 4. This looks promising.
So, we have 4, and the remaining numbers are 70 and 63.
Can we combine 4, 70, and 63 to get 11?
4 + 70 + 63 = 137 (too big)
4 + 70 - 63 = 11. This works!
Let's check if all numbers are used: 52, 13, 70, 63. Yes.
Let's check the operators: /, +, -. Yes.

The expression is (52 / 13) + 70 - 63.
Let's verify:
(52 / 13) = 4
4 + 70 = 74
74 - 63 = 11.

This is a valid solution.

Let's try another path just to be sure or to see if there are other solutions.

Attempt 2:
Try multiplication.
70 * ? ... unlikely to get 11.
52 * ? ... unlikely.
13 * ? ... unlikely.
63 * ? ... unlikely.

Attempt 3:
Try subtraction first.
70 - 63 = 7. Remaining numbers: 52, 13. Target from 7: 11. Need to get 4 from 52 and 13.
52 / 13 = 4.
So, (70 - 63) + (52 / 13) = 7 + 4 = 11.
This is another valid solution.

Attempt 4:
70 - 52 = 18. Remaining numbers: 13, 63. Target from 18: 11. Need to get -7 from 13 and 63.
13 - 63 = -50 (no)
63 - 13 = 50 (no)
13 / 63 (no)
63 / 13 (no)
13 * 63 (no)

Attempt 5:
63 - 52 = 11. Remaining numbers: 70, 13. Target from 11: 11. Need to get 0 from 70 and 13.
70 - 13 = 57 (no)
13 - 70 = -57 (no)
70 / 13 (no)
13 / 70 (no)
70 * 13 (no)

Attempt 6:
Let's go back to the first successful one: (52 / 13) + 70 - 63.
This uses all numbers and operators correctly.

Let's consider the second successful one: (70 - 63) + (52 / 13).
This also uses all numbers and operators correctly.

The prompt asks for ""the equation"". I will provide one of them. The first one I found seems straightforward.

(52 / 13) + 70 - 63 = 11

Let's double check the order of operations if parentheses were not explicit.
52 / 13 + 70 - 63
Division first: 4 + 70 - 63
Addition next: 74 - 63
Subtraction last: 11.
So, parentheses around 52/13 are not strictly necessary for this specific calculation, but they make the intention clearer. The prompt implies forming an equation, so including parentheses for clarity is good.

Let's consider the second solution again: (70 - 63) + (52 / 13)
70 - 63 + 52 / 13
Subtraction first (left to right): 7 + 52 / 13
Division next: 7 + 4
Addition last: 11.
Again, parentheses are helpful for clarity but not strictly required by standard order of operations for this specific arrangement.

I will present the first one I found.

The user wants me to find an arithmetic equation using the numbers [29, 94, 32, 76] that evaluates to 21.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the numbers: 29, 94, 32, 76.
Target: 21.

I need to try different combinations and see if I can reach 21.

Possible approaches:
1. Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.
2. Try to create smaller intermediate numbers that can then be combined.
3. Consider division first, as it can significantly reduce numbers.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(94 - 76) = 18
Now I have 18, 29, 32. Target is 21.
18 + 29 = 47. 47 - 32 = 15. Not 21.
18 - 29 = -11. -11 + 32 = 21. This works!
Let's check the numbers used: 94, 76, 29, 32. All used once.
The equation is (94 - 76) - 29 + 32.
Let's verify:
(94 - 76) = 18
18 - 29 = -11
-11 + 32 = 21.
This looks correct.

Let's try another path to be sure or to see if there are other solutions.

Attempt 2:
(76 / 2) = 38 (but 2 is not a given number, so this is invalid)
I must use the given numbers.

Attempt 3:
Let's try combining 32 and 76.
76 - 32 = 44. Numbers left: 29, 94. Target: 21.
44 + 29 = 73. 73 - 94 = -21. Close, but not 21.
44 - 29 = 15. 15 + 94 = 109. Not 21.
44 + 94 = 138. 138 - 29 = 109. Not 21.
44 - 94 = -50. -50 + 29 = -21. Close.

Attempt 4:
Let's try combining 29 and 94.
94 - 29 = 65. Numbers left: 32, 76. Target: 21.
65 - 32 = 33. 33 - 76 = -43.
65 + 32 = 97. 97 - 76 = 21. This works!
Let's check the numbers used: 94, 29, 32, 76. All used once.
The equation is (94 - 29) + 32 - 76.
Let's verify:
(94 - 29) = 65
65 + 32 = 97
97 - 76 = 21.
This is also a valid solution.

Attempt 5:
Let's try division.
Can any number be divided by another to get a useful integer?
94 / 29 = not integer
94 / 32 = not integer
94 / 76 = not integer
76 / 29 = not integer
76 / 32 = not integer
32 / 29 = not integer

What about using division to create a smaller number that can then be used?
Maybe something like (A - B) / C + D?

Let's re-examine Attempt 1: (94 - 76) - 29 + 32 = 21.
This is (18) - 29 + 32 = -11 + 32 = 21.

Let's re-examine Attempt 4: (94 - 29) + 32 - 76 = 21.
This is (65) + 32 - 76 = 97 - 76 = 21.

Both are valid. I will present one of them. The first one I found seems straightforward.

Let's double check the first solution: (94 - 76) - 29 + 32
Numbers used: 94, 76, 29, 32. All used once.
Operations: -, -, +. Standard arithmetic operations.
Result: 18 - 29 + 32 = -11 + 32 = 21. Target met.

Let's double check the second solution: (94 - 29) + 32 - 76
Numbers used: 94, 29, 32, 76. All used once.
Operations: -, +, -. Standard arithmetic operations.
Result: 65 + 32 - 76 = 97 - 76 = 21. Target met.

I will present the first one.
(94 - 76) - 29 + 32 = 21.
The order of operations matters. Parentheses are good for clarity.
If I write 94 - 76 - 29 + 32, it's evaluated left to right:
94 - 76 = 18
18 - 29 = -11
-11 + 32 = 21.
So parentheses are not strictly necessary for this specific order, but they make it clearer.

Let's consider if there's any ambiguity. The prompt says ""construct an arithmetic equation"".
The equation should be presented as a whole.

Let's try to see if multiplication or division could be involved in a different way.
Suppose we want to get a number close to 21 using multiplication.
29 * X, 94 * X, 32 * X, 76 * X. None of these will work with the remaining numbers to get 21.

What about division as the last step?
(Something) / (Something else) = 21.
This would require one part to be a multiple of 21.
Let's try to make 42 or 63 or 84 etc.

Can we make 42?
Using 29, 94, 32, 76.
Maybe (94 + 32) - (76 - 29) = 126 - 47 = 79. No.
Maybe (76 + 29) - (94 - 32) = 105 - 62 = 43. No.

Let's stick with the additive/subtractive solutions found.
(94 - 76) - 29 + 32 = 21.
This is a valid equation.

Let's consider the second solution again: (94 - 29) + 32 - 76 = 21.
This is also valid.

I will present the first one found.
The equation is (94 - 76) - 29 + 32.
It uses 94, 76, 29, 32 exactly once.
It uses -, -, +.
It evaluates to 21.

Final check:
Numbers: [29, 94, 32, 76]
Target: 21
Equation: (94 - 76) - 29 + 32
Step 1: 94 - 76 = 18 (Uses 94, 76)
Step 2: 18 - 29 = -11 (Uses 29)
Step 3: -11 + 32 = 21 (Uses 32)
All numbers used. Result is 21. Operations are valid.

Consider the second solution: (94 - 29) + 32 - 76
Step 1: 94 - 29 = 65 (Uses 94, 29)
Step 2: 65 + 32 = 97 (Uses 32)
Step 3: 97 - 76 = 21 (Uses 76)

Both are good. I'll pick one.

3966,704,"<think>The problem asks for an equation that evaluates to 70 using the numbers 89, 74, and 85 exactly once, with only the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

Let's list the numbers: N1 = 89, N2 = 74, N3 = 85.
We need to combine these three numbers using +, -, *, / to get 70.

There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers.
For each permutation, there are 3 positions for the operations, and each position can be one of the 4 operations. This gives 4^3 = 64 combinations of operations for each permutation.
However, the order of operations matters (parentheses). We can consider different groupings.

Let's try to combine two numbers first and then combine the result with the third number.

Possible pairings and operations:

The problem asks me to find an equation using the numbers [65, 15, 85, 23] and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target number 12. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: 65, 15, 85, 23.
Target: 12.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic operations. I should consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Parentheses can be used to control the order.

Let's try some combinations.

First, I'll look for ways to get numbers close to 12 or numbers that can easily combine to 12.
The numbers are quite spread out. 65, 15, 85, 23.

Possible operations:
Addition: 65+15 = 80, 65+85 = 150, 65+23 = 88, 15+85 = 100, 15+23 = 38, 85+23 = 108.
Subtraction: 65-15 = 50, 65-85 = -20, 65-23 = 42, 15-65 = -50, 15-85 = -70, 15-23 = -8, 85-65 = 20, 85-15 = 70, 85-23 = 62, 23-65 = -42, 23-15 = 8, 23-85 = -62.
Multiplication: 65*15 = 975, 65*85 = 5525, 65*23 = 1495, 15*85 = 1275, 15*23 = 345, 85*23 = 1955. These are all very large.
Division: 65/15 (not integer), 65/85 (not integer), 65/23 (not integer), 15/65 (not integer), 15/85 (not integer), 15/23 (not integer), 85/65 (not integer), 85/15 (not integer), 85/23 (not integer), 23/65 (not integer), 23/15 (not integer), 23/85 (not integer).
It seems direct division of these numbers won't yield integers easily. However, intermediate results might be divisible.

Let's try to combine two numbers first and then use the other two.

Try combining 65 and 15:
65 + 15 = 80. Remaining: 85, 23. Target: 12. Can we get 12 from 80, 85, 23?
80 + 85 + 23 = 188
80 + 85 - 23 = 142
80 - 85 + 23 = 18
80 - 85 - 23 = -28
80 + 23 - 85 = 18
80 - 23 + 85 = 142
80 * 85 ... too big.
80 / 85 ... not integer.

65 - 15 = 50. Remaining: 85, 23. Target: 12.
50 + 85 + 23 = 158
50 + 85 - 23 = 112
50 - 85 + 23 = -12
50 - 85 - 23 = -58
50 + 23 - 85 = -12
50 - 23 + 85 = 112

This is interesting: 50 - 85 + 23 = -12. We need +12.
What about (65 - 15) - (85 - 23)?
(65 - 15) = 50
(85 - 23) = 62
50 - 62 = -12. Still -12.

What about (65 - 15) + (23 - 85)?
50 + (-62) = -12.

What about (85 - 23) - (65 - 15)?
62 - 50 = 12. This works!
Let's check:
Numbers used: 85, 23, 65, 15. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, -. Allowed.
Equation: (85 - 23) - (65 - 15)
Evaluation:
85 - 23 = 62
65 - 15 = 50
62 - 50 = 12.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try other combinations just to be sure or to see if there are simpler ones.

Try combining 65 and 85:
85 - 65 = 20. Remaining: 15, 23. Target: 12.
20 + 15 + 23 = 58
20 + 15 - 23 = 12. This works!
Let's check:
Numbers used: 85, 65, 15, 23. All used exactly once.
Operations used: -, +, -. Allowed.
Equation: (85 - 65) + 15 - 23
Evaluation:
85 - 65 = 20
20 + 15 = 35
35 - 23 = 12.
This is also a valid solution.

Let's try combining 85 and 15:
85 - 15 = 70. Remaining: 65, 23. Target: 12.
70 + 65 + 23 = 158
70 + 65 - 23 = 112
70 - 65 + 23 = 28
70 - 65 - 23 = -18
70 + 23 - 65 = 28
70 - 23 + 65 = 112

Let's try combining 23 and 15:
23 - 15 = 8. Remaining: 65, 85. Target: 12.
8 + 65 + 85 = 158
8 + 65 - 85 = -12
8 - 65 + 85 = 28
8 - 65 - 85 = -142
8 + 85 - 65 = 28
8 - 85 + 65 = -12

Let's try division.
Maybe we can get a small number by division.
None of the numbers divide each other nicely.
What if we create a number that divides another?
For example, can we make 5 from 15 and 23? No.
Can we make 3 from 15 and 65? No.

Let's revisit the first solution: (85 - 23) - (65 - 15) = 12.
This is clean and uses parentheses.

Let's revisit the second solution: (85 - 65) + 15 - 23 = 12.
This is also clean and doesn't strictly need parentheses if we follow order of operations, but they help clarity. (85 - 65) + 15 - 23 = 20 + 15 - 23 = 35 - 23 = 12.

Let's try to use multiplication.
If we multiply two numbers, the result is large.
65 * 15 = 975
65 * 85 = 5525
65 * 23 = 1495
15 * 85 = 1275
15 * 23 = 345
85 * 23 = 1955

If we have a large number, we need to subtract a lot.
Let's try 15 * 23 = 345. Remaining: 65, 85. Target: 12.

The combination 50 / 5 + 23 = 33 seems to be the correct one.
Let's verify:

We need to combine these three numbers using the operations to get 12. There are a few possible ways to arrange the numbers and operations.

This uses 54, 31, 11 exactly once and the operations - and +.

The problem statement implies a single expression. If parentheses are allowed, more combinations open up. However, the phrasing ""single mathematical equation"" and the simplicity of the operations suggest a linear expression without explicit parentheses, or where standard order of operations applies. The solutions found so far (15 + 73 - 51, 15 - 51 + 73, 73 - 51 + 15) do not require explicit parentheses as addition and subtraction have the same precedence and are evaluated left-to-right.

5592,1293,"<think>The target value is 50. The given numbers are 43, 91, and 98. I need to use each number exactly once with basic arithmetic operations.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 98.
If I subtract something from 98, I need to get 50. So, 98 - x = 50, which means x = 48.
Can I get 48 from 43 and 91?
91 - 43 = 48. This works!
So, the equation would be 98 - (91 - 43).
Let's check: 98 - (91 - 43) = 98 - 48 = 50.
This uses all numbers (43, 91, 98) exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's explore other possibilities to be sure, though the first one seems valid.

Possibility 2: Start with 91.
If I add something to 91, it will be greater than 50.
If I subtract something from 91, I need 91 - x = 50, so x = 41.
Can I get 41 from 43 and 98?
98 - 43 = 55 (not 41)
43 - 98 = -55 (not 41)
98 / 43 (not an integer)
43 / 98 (not an integer)
43 * 98 (too large)

Possibility 3: Start with 43.
If I add something to 43, I need 43 + x = 50, so x = 7.
Can I get 7 from 91 and 98?
98 - 91 = 7. This works!
So, the equation would be 43 + (98 - 91).
Let's check: 43 + (98 - 91) = 43 + 7 = 50.
This also uses all numbers (43, 91, 98) exactly once and only basic operations.

Both 98 - (91 - 43) and 43 + (98 - 91) are valid solutions. I will present one of them. The first one found is 98 - (91 - 43).

2.  (77 + 40) - 63 = 54
3.  77 - (63 - 40) = 54
4.  77 + (40 - 63) = 54

The problem asks for *an* equation. I will present the first one I found as it's straightforward.

Let's double-check the constraints:
- Numbers: [77, 63, 40] - used exactly once. Yes.
- Operations: +, -, *, / - used only basic arithmetic. Yes.
- Target: 54 - achieved. Yes.

The equation (77 - 63) + 40 = 54 satisfies all conditions.
I will present this one.

1979,859,"<think>The target number is 58. The available numbers are 24, 10, 13, and 73. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try to combine the numbers in different ways.

First, look at the largest number, 73.
If we subtract something from 73, we need to get a number close to 58.
73 - X = 58 => X = 73 - 58 = 15.
Can we make 15 using 24, 10, and 13?
10 + 13 = 23. Not 15.
24 - 10 = 14. Close.

13 - 10 = 3.
24 / 10 is not an integer.
24 / 13 is not an integer.
10 / 13 is not an integer.
10 * 13 = 130.
24 * 10 = 240.
24 * 13 = 312.

Let's try adding to 73.
73 + X = 58. This would mean X is negative, which is unlikely with only positive numbers and basic operations.

Let's try using multiplication.
If we multiply two numbers, the result will be quite large.
24 * 10 = 240.
24 * 13 = 312.
24 * 73 = 1752.
10 * 13 = 130.
10 * 73 = 730.
13 * 73 = 949.

Let's try dividing.
73 / 24, 73 / 10, 73 / 13, 24 / 10, 24 / 13, 10 / 13. None of these give simple integers.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

Possibility 1: Start with the largest number, 95.
How can I get from 95 to 32 using 17 and 46?
95 - ? = 32  => ? = 95 - 32 = 63. Can I make 63 from 17 and 46?

This uses all numbers (17, 95, 46) exactly once and only uses allowed operations.

Let's explore other possibilities just to be sure or to see if there are simpler forms.

Possibility 2: Start with 46.
46 - ? = 32 => ? = 46 - 32 = 14. Can I make 14 from 17 and 95?
95 / 17 is not an integer.
95 - 17 = 78.
17 - 95 is negative.
95 * 17 is too large.

So, this path doesn't seem easy.

Let's try multiplication or division first.

Possibility 4: Using multiplication.
Can I multiply two numbers and then adjust with the third?
17 * 46 = 782. Too large.
17 * 95 = 1615. Too large.
46 * 95 = 4370. Too large.

95 / 46 is not an integer.
46 / 17 is not an integer.
17 / 95 is a fraction.
17 / 46 is a fraction.
46 / 95 is a fraction.

Let's reconsider the subtraction approach.
We found 95 - (17 + 46) = 32. This is a valid solution.

Are there other ways to arrange 17, 46, and 95 to get 32?
What if we subtract 95 from something?
? - 95 = 32 => ? = 127. Can I make 127 from 17 and 46?
17 + 46 = 63. No.
17 * 46 = 782. No.

What if we subtract 46 from something?
? - 46 = 32 => ? = 78. Can I make 78 from 17 and 95?
95 - 17 = 78. Yes!
So, the equation could be (95 - 17) - 46.
Let's check: (95 - 17) - 46 = 78 - 46 = 32.
This also uses all numbers (17, 95, 46) exactly once and only uses allowed operations.

Both 95 - (17 + 46) and (95 - 17) - 46 are valid. The user asked for *a* single equation. I will present one of them. The second one might be slightly more direct in terms of operations.

The user wants me to find a single mathematical expression that uses the numbers 43, 68, and 45 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to achieve a target value of 20.

Let's list the numbers: [43, 68, 45]
Target: 20

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations. Since there are only three numbers, the structure of the expression will be relatively simple, likely involving two operations.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try different pairings and operations.

Numbers: 43, 68, 45

**Attempt 1: Start with multiplication/division**

*   Try combining 68 and 45 first.
    *   68 * 45 = 3060 (Too large)
    *   68 / 45 = 1.511... (Not a clean number, unlikely to lead to 20 easily)
    *   45 / 68 = 0.66... (Not clean)
    *   68 + 45 = 113
    *   68 - 45 = 23
    *   45 - 68 = -23

*   Try combining 43 and 68 first.
    *   43 * 68 = 2924 (Too large)
    *   43 / 68 = 0.63... (Not clean)
    *   68 / 43 = 1.58... (Not clean)
    *   43 + 68 = 111
    *   43 - 68 = -25
    *   68 - 43 = 25

*   Try combining 43 and 45 first.
    *   43 * 45 = 1935 (Too large)
    *   43 / 45 = 0.95... (Not clean)
    *   45 / 43 = 1.04... (Not clean)
    *   43 + 45 = 88
    *   43 - 45 = -2
    *   45 - 43 = 2

Let's focus on intermediate results that are close to 20 or could lead to 20.
The result '2' from (45 - 43) looks promising.

**Scenario 1: (45 - 43) = 2**
Now I have the number 2 and the remaining number is 68.
I need to combine 2 and 68 using one operation to get 20.
*   2 + 68 = 70 (No)
*   2 - 68 = -66 (No)
*   68 - 2 = 66 (No)
*   2 * 68 = 136 (No)
*   2 / 68 = 0.029... (No)
*   68 / 2 = 34 (No)

This path (45 - 43) doesn't seem to work directly.

**Scenario 2: (68 - 43) = 25**
Now I have 25 and the remaining number is 45.
I need to combine 25 and 45 using one operation to get 20.
*   25 + 45 = 70 (No)
*   25 - 45 = -20 (Close, but wrong sign)
*   45 - 25 = 20 (YES!)

So, the expression could be (68 - 43) and then use 45.
The structure is (a op b) op c.
Let a = 68, b = 43, c = 45.
(68 - 43) = 25.
Then, 45 - 25 = 20.
This means the expression is 45 - (68 - 43).
Let's check: 45 - (68 - 43) = 45 - 25 = 20.
This uses 43, 68, and 45 exactly once. It uses subtraction twice. The target is 20. This looks like a valid solution.

Let's explore other possibilities to be thorough.

**Scenario 3: (43 - 45) = -2**
Now I have -2 and the remaining number is 68.
I need to combine -2 and 68 using one operation to get 20.
*   -2 + 68 = 66 (No)
*   -2 - 68 = -70 (No)
*   68 - (-2) = 68 + 2 = 70 (No)
*   -2 * 68 = -136 (No)
*   -2 / 68 = -0.029... (No)
*   68 / -2 = -34 (No)

**Scenario 4: Using division to get smaller numbers**

What if we try to get a number that, when multiplied by one of the other numbers, gets close to 20?
Or a number that, when added/subtracted from another, gets close to 20.

Let's try to get 20 directly from two numbers first.
*   43 + ? = 20 (Need -23)
*   43 - ? = 20 (Need 23)
*   ? - 43 = 20 (Need 63)
*   43 * ? = 20 (Need 20/43)
*   43 / ? = 20 (Need 43/20)
*   ? / 43 = 20 (Need 860)

*   68 + ? = 20 (Need -48)
*   68 - ? = 20 (Need 48)
*   ? - 68 = 20 (Need 88)
*   68 * ? = 20 (Need 20/68)
*   68 / ? = 20 (Need 68/20 = 3.4)
*   ? / 68 = 20 (Need 1360)

*   45 + ? = 20 (Need -25)
*   45 - ? = 20 (Need 25)
*   ? - 45 = 20 (Need 65)
*   45 * ? = 20 (Need 20/45)
*   45 / ? = 20 (Need 45/20 = 2.25)
*   ? / 45 = 20 (Need 900)

The intermediate result '25' from (68 - 43) was useful.
Let's see if we can get 25 from other combinations.
*   43 + 68 = 111
*   43 - 68 = -25
*   43 * 68 = 2924
*   43 / 68
*   68 / 43

*   43 + 45 = 88
*   43 - 45 = -2
*   43 * 45 = 1935
*   43 / 45
*   45 / 43

*   68 + 45 = 113
*   68 - 45 = 23
*   68 * 45 = 3060
*   68 / 45
*   45 / 68

The only way to get 25 or -25 from two numbers is (68 - 43) or (43 - 68).

If we have (68 - 43) = 25, we need to use 45 to get 20.
45 - 25 = 20. This gives 45 - (68 - 43).

If we have (43 - 68) = -25, we need to use 45 to get 20.
45 + (-25) = 20. This gives 45 + (43 - 68).
Let's check: 45 + (43 - 68) = 45 + (-25) = 20.
This is also a valid solution.

2722,437,"<think>The problem requires me to use the numbers 44, 77, and 38 exactly once, along with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to form an equation that evaluates to 83.

Let's list the numbers: [44, 77, 38].
The target value is 83.

I need to combine these three numbers using the allowed operations. Since there are three numbers, there will be two operations. The order of operations matters, so I should consider parentheses as well, although the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention them. However, to achieve a specific result, parentheses are often necessary to control the order of operations. Let's assume parentheses are implicitly allowed to group operations.

Let's try different combinations and see if any result in 83.

4904,1601,"<think>The numbers are 5, 3, and 93. The target is 78.
I need to combine 5, 3, and 93 using +, -, *, / to get 78.

Let's try combinations:
1.  Start with 93.
    *   93 - 5 = 88. Then use 3. 88 - 3 = 85 (no). 88 + 3 = 91 (no). 88 * 3 = 264 (no). 88 / 3 (not an integer).
    *   93 - 3 = 90. Then use 5. 90 - 5 = 85 (no). 90 + 5 = 95 (no). 90 * 5 = 450 (no). 90 / 5 = 18 (no).
    *   93 + 5 = 98. Then use 3. 98 - 3 = 95 (no). 98 + 3 = 101 (no). 98 * 3 = 294 (no). 98 / 3 (not an integer).
    *   93 + 3 = 96. Then use 5. 96 - 5 = 91 (no). 96 + 5 = 101 (no). 96 * 5 = 480 (no). 96 / 5 (not an integer).
    *   93 * 5 = 465. Then use 3. 465 - 3 = 462 (no). 465 + 3 = 468 (no). 465 / 3 = 155 (no).
    *   93 * 3 = 279. Then use 5. 279 - 5 = 274 (no). 279 + 5 = 284 (no). 279 / 5 (not an integer).
    *   93 / 3 = 31. Then use 5. 31 - 5 = 26 (no). 31 + 5 = 36 (no). 31 * 5 = 155 (no).

2.  Combine 5 and 3 first.
    *   5 + 3 = 8. Then use 93. 93 - 8 = 85 (no). 93 + 8 = 101 (no). 93 * 8 = 744 (no). 93 / 8 (not an integer).
    *   5 - 3 = 2. Then use 93. 93 - 2 = 91 (no). 93 + 2 = 95 (no). 93 * 2 = 186 (no). 93 / 2 (not an integer).
    *   3 - 5 = -2. Then use 93. 93 - (-2) = 95 (no). 93 + (-2) = 91 (no). 93 * (-2) = -186 (no).

    *   3 / 5 (not an integer).

The combination (5 * 3) and then subtracting from 93 works.
Equation: 93 - (5 * 3)

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 93, 5, 3. All used once.
Operations used: -, *. Basic operations.
Evaluation: 93 - (5 * 3) = 93 - 15 = 78. Correct.

Another possibility:
What if we multiply 5 by something related to 93 and 3?
Target is 78.
78 / 5 is not an integer.
78 / 3 = 26. Can we get 26 from 93 and 5?
93 - 5 = 88 (no)
93 + 5 = 98 (no)
93 * 5 = 465 (no)
93 / 5 (not integer)

What if we multiply 3 by something related to 93 and 5?
Target is 78.
78 / 3 = 26. Can we get 26 from 93 and 5?
We already checked this.

What if we multiply 93 by something?
93 * 5 = 465 (too big)
93 * 3 = 279 (too big)

Let's re-examine 93 - (5 * 3). This seems to be the most straightforward.

Could there be another way?
Maybe division is involved in a different way.
(93 + 3) / 5 = 96 / 5 (not integer)
(93 - 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 (no)
(93 + 5) / 3 = 98 / 3 (not integer)
(93 - 5) / 3 = 88 / 3 (not integer)

Let's consider the order of operations carefully.
We found 93 - (5 * 3) = 78.

What about (3 * 5) - 93? That would be 15 - 93 = -78 (no).
What about 5 * (93 / 3)? 5 * 31 = 155 (no).
What about 3 * (93 / 5)? Not integer.
What about 5 * (3 - 93)? 5 * (-90) = -450 (no).
What about 3 * (5 - 93)? 3 * (-88) = -264 (no).

The solution 93 - (5 * 3) is valid.
Let's check if there's any other.
Consider 5 * X + Y or 5 * X - Y etc.
If 5 * X = 78, X = 15.6 (not possible with 3 and 93).
If 5 * X = 78 + Y or 78 - Y.
If 5 * X = 78 + 3 = 81 (not divisible by 5).
If 5 * X = 78 - 3 = 75. X = 15. Can we get 15 from 93? No.
If 5 * X = 78 + 93 = 171 (not divisible by 5).
If 5 * X = 78 - 93 = -15. X = -3. Can we get -3 from 3? No.

If 3 * X = 78, X = 26. Can we get 26 from 93 and 5?
93 - 5 = 88 (no)
93 + 5 = 98 (no)
93 / 5 (not integer)
5 - 93 = -88 (no)
5 + 93 = 98 (no)
5 * 93 = 465 (no)

If 3 * X = 78 + 5 = 83 (not divisible by 3).
If 3 * X = 78 - 5 = 73 (not divisible by 3).
If 3 * X = 78 + 93 = 171. X = 57. Can we get 57 from 5? No.
If 3 * X = 78 - 93 = -15. X = -5. Can we get -5 from 5? No.

If 93 * X = 78, X = 78/93 (not integer).

Let's consider subtractions from 93.
93 - (something) = 78.
Something = 93 - 78 = 15.
Can we get 15 from 5 and 3? Yes, 5 * 3 = 15.
So, 93 - (5 * 3) = 78.

Let's consider additions to 93.
93 + (something) = 78.
Something = 78 - 93 = -15.
Can we get -15 from 5 and 3?
3 - 5 = -2 (no)
5 - 3 = 2 (no)

The user wants an equation using the numbers 79, 26, 7, and 9 to reach the target 69.
Each number must be used exactly once.
Allowed operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's try combinations:

1.  Try using the largest number first: 79
    *   79 - ? = 69. This means ? = 10. Can we make 10 from 26, 7, 9?
        *   26 / ? = 10 (No)
        *   26 - ? = 10. ? = 16. Can we make 16 from 7, 9? 7 + 9 = 16. Yes!
        *   So, 79 - (26 - (7 + 9)) = 79 - (26 - 16) = 79 - 10 = 69. This works.
        *   Let's check the numbers used: 79, 26, 7, 9. All used exactly once.
        *   Let's check the operations: -, -, +. All basic.

Let's verify the order of operations:
79 - (26 - (7 + 9))
= 79 - (26 - 16)
= 79 - 10
= 69

This is a valid solution.

Let's try another approach just to be sure or to find a simpler one.

2.  Try multiplication:
    *   Maybe something like (A * B) + C - D = 69?
    *   (7 * 9) + 26 - 79 = 63 + 26 - 79 = 89 - 79 = 10 (Not 69)
    *   (7 * 26) ... too large.
    *   (9 * 26) ... too large.

3.  Try division:
    *   Maybe something like (79 / ?) ... 79 is prime, so division is unlikely to yield a whole number easily.

Let's go back to the first solution found: 79 - (26 - (7 + 9)) = 69.
This is a good solution.

Can we rearrange it?
79 - (26 - 16) = 69
79 - 26 + 16 = 69
79 - 26 + (7 + 9) = 69. This is also valid.
Numbers: 79, 26, 7, 9. Used once.
Operations: -, +, +. Basic.

Let's check this one:
79 - 26 + (7 + 9)
= 79 - 26 + 16
= 53 + 16
= 69

This is also a valid solution and perhaps slightly simpler in terms of parenthesis nesting.

Let's try one more.
What if we try to make 69 directly?
*   79 - 10 = 69. We made 10 from 26, 7, 9 as 26 - (7+9).
*   What if we try to make 69 from other numbers?
    *   26 * 3 = 78. Need -9. Can we make 3 from 79, 7, 9? No.
    *   7 * 10 = 70. Need -1. Can we make 10 from 79, 26, 9? No.
    *   9 * 8 = 72. Need -3. Can we make 8 from 79, 26, 7? No.

The solution 79 - 26 + (7 + 9) = 69 seems robust.
Another variation: 79 - (26 - 7 - 9) = 79 - (19 - 9) = 79 - 10 = 69.
Numbers: 79, 26, 7, 9. Used once.
Operations: -, -, -. Basic.

Let's check:
79 - (26 - 7 - 9)
= 79 - (19 - 9)
= 79 - 10
= 69

This is also a valid solution.

The simplest one in terms of operations might be 79 - 26 + 7 + 9 = 69.
Let's check:
79 - 26 + 7 + 9
= 53 + 7 + 9
= 60 + 9
= 69
Numbers: 79, 26, 7, 9. Used once.
Operations: -, +, +. Basic.

   - 47 - 0.5 = 46.5
   - 0.5 * 47 = 23.5
   - 0.5 / 47 = not integer
   - 47 / 0.5 = 94

The solution (48 - 47) * 24 = 24 seems to be the most straightforward and correct one.
Let's double check the requirements:

The problem requires me to form an arithmetic equation using the numbers 3, 56, and 27 exactly once. The allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The target result is 87.

Let the set of numbers be S = {3, 56, 27}.
The target value is T = 87.

I need to arrange these three numbers with two operations to get 87.
The possible arrangements of the numbers are permutations of (3, 56, 27).
The possible operations are +, -, *, /.

Let's list the possible structures of the equation:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c = 87
2. a op1 (b op2 c) = 87

Where a, b, c are the numbers from the set {3, 56, 27} in some order, and op1, op2 are operations from {+, -, *, /}.

Let's consider the numbers and the target value. 87 is relatively close to 56.
87 - 56 = 31. Can I get 31 from 3 and 27?
3 + 27 = 30 (close)
27 - 3 = 24
3 * 27 = 81
27 / 3 = 9

Let's try starting with 56.
If 56 is involved in addition:
56 + x = 87 => x = 31. Can I get 31 from 3 and 27? No, as seen above.
If 56 is involved in subtraction:
x - 56 = 87 => x = 143. Can I get 143 from 3 and 27? No.
56 - x = 87 => x = -31. Can I get -31 from 3 and 27? No.
If 56 is involved in multiplication:
56 * x = 87. x = 87/56 (not an integer, unlikely to work with integers 3 and 27).
If 56 is involved in division:
x / 56 = 87 => x = 87 * 56 (too large).
56 / x = 87 => x = 56/87 (not an integer).

This suggests that 56 might not be the first number in a simple addition or subtraction leading directly to 87.

Let's try combining 3 and 27 first.
Possible results from (3 op1 27):
3 + 27 = 30
3 - 27 = -24
27 - 3 = 24
3 * 27 = 81
27 / 3 = 9

Now, let's combine these results with 56 using the remaining operation.

Case 1: Result from (3 op1 27) is 30.
We have 30 and 56. Target is 87.
30 + 56 = 86 (close)
56 + 30 = 86 (same)
56 - 30 = 26
30 - 56 = -26
30 * 56 = 1680
56 * 30 = 1680
56 / 30 (not integer)
30 / 56 (not integer)
So, (3 + 27) + 56 = 86. Not 87.

Case 2: Result from (3 op1 27) is -24.
We have -24 and 56. Target is 87.
-24 + 56 = 32
56 + (-24) = 32
56 - (-24) = 56 + 24 = 80 (close)
-24 - 56 = -80
-24 * 56 (large negative)
56 * -24 (large negative)
56 / -24 (not integer)
-24 / 56 (not integer)
So, 56 - (3 - 27) = 80. Not 87.

Case 3: Result from (3 op1 27) is 24.
We have 24 and 56. Target is 87.
24 + 56 = 80 (close)
56 + 24 = 80 (same)
56 - 24 = 32
24 - 56 = -32
24 * 56 (large)
56 * 24 (large)
56 / 24 (not integer)
24 / 56 (not integer)
So, (27 - 3) + 56 = 80. Not 87.

Case 4: Result from (3 op1 27) is 81.
We have 81 and 56. Target is 87.
81 + 56 = 137
56 + 81 = 137
81 - 56 = 25
56 - 81 = -25
81 * 56 (large)
56 * 81 (large)
56 / 81 (not integer)
81 / 56 (not integer)
So, (3 * 27) + 56 = 137. Not 87.

Case 5: Result from (3 op1 27) is 9.
We have 9 and 56. Target is 87.
9 + 56 = 65
56 + 9 = 65
56 - 9 = 47
9 - 56 = -47
9 * 56 = 504
56 * 9 = 504
56 / 9 (not integer)
9 / 56 (not integer)
So, (27 / 3) + 56 = 65. Not 87.

This approach of combining 3 and 27 first doesn't seem to yield 87 directly.

Let's try combining 56 and 3 first.
Possible results from (56 op1 3):
56 + 3 = 59
56 - 3 = 53
3 - 56 = -53
56 * 3 = 168
56 / 3 (not integer)
3 / 56 (not integer)

Now, let's combine these results with 27 using the remaining operation.

Case 1: Result from (56 op1 3) is 59.
We have 59 and 27. Target is 87.
59 + 27 = 86 (close)
27 + 59 = 86 (same)
59 - 27 = 32
27 - 59 = -32
59 * 27 (large)
27 * 59 (large)
59 / 27 (not integer)
27 / 59 (not integer)
So, (56 + 3) + 27 = 86. Not 87.

Case 2: Result from (56 op1 3) is 53.
We have 53 and 27. Target is 87.
53 + 27 = 80 (close)
27 + 53 = 80 (same)
53 - 27 = 26
27 - 53 = -26
53 * 27 (large)
27 * 53 (large)
53 / 27 (not integer)
27 / 53 (not integer)
So, (56 - 3) + 27 = 80. Not 87.

Case 3: Result from (56 op1 3) is -53.
We have -53 and 27. Target is 87.
-53 + 27 = -26
27 + (-53) = -26
27 - (-53) = 27 + 53 = 80 (close)
-53 - 27 = -80
-53 * 27 (large negative)
27 * -53 (large negative)
27 / -53 (not integer)
-53 / 27 (not integer)
So, 27 - (3 - 56) = 80. Not 87.

Case 4: Result from (56 op1 3) is ",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 81, 42, and 86 that evaluates to 47.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try combinations:
1. (81 + 42) - 86 = 123 - 86 = 37 (Too low)
2. (81 - 42) + 86 = 39 + 86 = 125 (Too high)
3. (81 * 42) - 86 = 3402 - 86 = 3316 (Too high)
4. (81 / 42) - 86 = (approx 1.9) - 86 (Not an integer, unlikely to work out nicely)
5. 81 + (42 - 86) = 81 + (-44) = 37 (Too low)
6. 81 - (42 + 86) = 81 - 128 = -47 (Close, but negative)
7. 81 - (86 - 42) = 81 - 44 = 37 (Too low)
8. 42 + (81 - 86) = 42 + (-5) = 37 (Too low)
9. 42 - (81 + 86) = 42 - 167 = -125 (Too low)
10. 42 - (86 - 81) = 42 - 5 = 37 (Too low)
11. 86 + (42 - 81) = 86 + (-39) = 47 (This works!)
12. 86 - (81 - 42) = 86 - 39 = 47 (This also works!)
13. 86 - (42 - 81) = 86 - (-39) = 86 + 39 = 125 (Too high)

Let's verify the two working solutions:
Solution 1: 86 + (42 - 81)
Numbers used: 86, 42, 81 (all used once)
Operations: +, - (basic arithmetic)
Evaluation: 86 + (-39) = 47. Correct.

Solution 2: 86 - (81 - 42)
Numbers used: 86, 81, 42 (all used once)
Operations: -, - (basic arithmetic)
Evaluation: 86 - (39) = 47. Correct.

I will choose one of them. The second one seems slightly more straightforward.

The problem asks me to use the numbers 2, 16, and 58 exactly once each, along with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), to reach the target value of 45.

Let's list the numbers: {2, 16, 58}
Target: 45

I need to explore different combinations and permutations of these numbers and operations.

Possible structures for the equation:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try different pairings of numbers first.

Pairing 1: 2 and 16
- 2 + 16 = 18. Then use 58.
    - 18 + 58 = 76 (Too high)
    - 18 - 58 = -40 (Too low)
    - 58 - 18 = 40 (Close, but not 45)
    - 18 * 58 = 1044 (Too high)
    - 58 / 18 = Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 45 easily.
- 2 - 16 = -14. Then use 58.
    - -14 + 58 = 44 (Very close! Just need +1)
    - 58 - (-14) = 58 + 14 = 72 (Too high)
    - -14 - 58 = -72 (Too low)
    - -14 * 58 = Negative, too low.
    - 58 / -14 = Not an integer.
- 16 - 2 = 14. Then use 58.
    - 14 + 58 = 72 (Too high)
    - 58 - 14 = 44 (Very close! Just need +1)
    - 14 - 58 = -44 (Too low)
    - 14 * 58 = Too high.
    - 58 / 14 = Not an integer.
- 2 * 16 = 32. Then use 58.
    - 32 + 58 = 90 (Too high)
    - 58 - 32 = 26 (Too low)
    - 32 - 58 = -26 (Too low)
    - 32 * 58 = Too high.
    - 58 / 32 = Not an integer.
- 16 / 2 = 8. Then use 58.
    - 8 + 58 = 66 (Too high)
    - 58 - 8 = 50 (Close, but not 45)
    - 8 - 58 = -50 (Too low)
    - 8 * 58 = Too high.
    - 58 / 8 = Not an integer.
- 2 / 16 = Not an integer.

Pairing 2: 2 and 58
- 2 + 58 = 60. Then use 16.
    - 60 + 16 = 76 (Too high)
    - 60 - 16 = 44 (Very close! Just need +1)
    - 16 - 60 = -44 (Too low)
    - 60 * 16 = Too high.
    - 60 / 16 = Not an integer.
- 58 - 2 = 56. Then use 16.
    - 56 + 16 = 72 (Too high)
    - 56 - 16 = 40 (Close, but not 45)
    - 16 - 56 = -40 (Too low)
    - 56 * 16 = Too high.
    - 56 / 16 = Not an integer.
- 2 - 58 = -56. Then use 16.
    - -56 + 16 = -40 (Too low)
    - 16 - (-56) = 16 + 56 = 72 (Too high)
    - -56 - 16 = -72 (Too low)
    - -56 * 16 = Negative, too low.
    - -56 / 16 = Not an integer.
- 2 * 58 = 116. Then use 16.
    - 116 + 16 = 132 (Too high)
    - 116 - 16 = 100 (Too high)
    - 16 - 116 = -100 (Too low)
    - 116 * 16 = Too high.
    - 116 / 16 = Not an integer.
- 58 / 2 = 29. Then use 16.
    - 29 + 16 = 45 (Exactly the target! This looks promising.)
    - 29 - 16 = 13 (Too low)
    - 16 - 29 = -13 (Too low)
    - 29 * 16 = Too high.
    - 29 / 16 = Not an integer.

Let's verify the combination (58 / 2) + 16.
Numbers used: 58, 2, 16. All used exactly once.
Operations used: division, addition. Basic arithmetic operations.
Calculation: 58 / 2 = 29. Then 29 + 16 = 45.
This matches the target.

Let's check the other close ones we found:
- (2 - 16) + 58 = -14 + 58 = 44. Need +1.
- (16 - 2) + 58 = 14 + 58 = 72.
- (2 + 58) - 16 = 60 - 16 = 44. Need +1.
- (58 - 2) - 16 = 56 - 16 = 40. Need +5.

The combination (58 / 2) + 16 = 45 seems to be the correct solution.

Let's consider the structure a op (b op c) as well, just to be thorough.
Using the successful pairing (58/2) and 16.
This implies the structure (58 / 2) + 16. This is of the form (a op b) op c.

What if we tried 16 + (58 / 2)? This is a op (b op c).
16 + (58 / 2) = 16 + 29 = 45. This is also a valid solution.

The problem asks for ""your equation"". Both (58 / 2) + 16 and 16 + (58 / 2) are valid. I will present one of them.

Let's try pairing 16 and 58 first.
- 16 + 58 = 74. Then use 2.
    - 74 + 2 = 76
    - 74 - 2 = 72
    - 2 - 74 = -72
    - 74 * 2 = 148
    - 74 / 2 = 37 (Close, but not 45)
- 58 - 16 = 42. Then use 2.
    - 42 + 2 = 44 (Very close!)
    - 42 - 2 = 40
    - 2 - 42 = -40
    - 42 * 2 = 84
    - 42 / 2 = 21
- 16 - 58 = -42. Then use 2.
    - -42 + 2 = -40
    - 2 - (-42) = 44 (Very close!)
    - -42 - 2 = -44
    - -42 * 2 = -84
    - -42 / 2 = -21
- 16 * 58 = Too high.
- 58 / 16 = Not integer.
- 16 / 58 = Not integer.

From the (58 - 16) + 2 = 44 and 2 - (16 - 58) = 2 - (-42) = 44, we are consistently getting 44. We need 45. This suggests we need",0.0,Answer tags not found or malformed.

The user wants a mathematical expression using the numbers 81, 7, and 63 exactly once, along with the operators +, -, *, /. The target value is 11.

Let's list the numbers: [81, 7, 63]
Target: 11
Allowed operators: +, -, *, /

I need to try different combinations of these numbers and operators. Since there are only three numbers, the structure of the expression will be relatively simple, likely involving two operations. The possible structures are:
1. (a op1 b) op2 c
2. a op1 (b op2 c)

Let's systematically explore combinations.

Let's continue exploring just to be thorough and ensure there aren't other simpler or more elegant solutions, or to confirm this is a good one.

*   **81 - 7 * 63:** 81 - 441 = -360 (Too low)
*   **81 - 7 / 63:** 81 - 1/9 (Not an integer)
*   **81 * 7 + 63:** 567 + 63 = 630 (Too high)
*   **81 * 7 - 63:** 567 - 63 = 504 (Too high)

*   **7 / 81 + 63:** (Not integer)

*   **63 + 81 - 7:** 144 - 7 = 137 (Too high)

*   **63 * 7 - 81:** 441 - 81 = 360 (Too high)
*   **63 / 81 + 7:** (Not integer)
*   **63 / 7 + 81:** 9 + 81 = 90 (Not 11)
*   **63 / 7 - 81:** 9 - 81 = -72 (Too low)
*   **63 / 7 * 81:** 9 * 81 = 729 (Too high)

Let's re-examine the division possibilities more carefully.
We have 81, 7, 63.
Divisions that result in integers:
*   81 / ? (No integer divisor among 7, 63)
*   63 / 7 = 9
*   63 / ? (No other integer divisor among 81, 7)
*   7 / ? (No integer divisor)

So, the only useful integer division is 63 / 7 = 9.

Let's use this result (9) and the remaining number (81) to get 11.
We have 9 and 81.
*   9 + 81 = 90 (Not 11)
*   9 - 81 = -72 (Not 11)
*   81 + 9 = 90 (Not 11)
*   81 - 9 = 72 (Not 11)
*   9 * 81 = 729 (Not 11)
*   81 / 9 = 9 (Not 11)

This means the structure must be (a op1 b) op2 c, where the division is not the last operation.

Let's revisit the 63 / 7 = 9.
The expression could be:
*   (63 / 7) + 81 = 9 + 81 = 90 (No)
*   (63 / 7) - 81 = 9 - 81 = -72 (No)
*   81 + (63 / 7) = 81 + 9 = 90 (No)
*   81 - (63 / 7) = 81 - 9 = 72 (No)

What if 81 is divided by something?
81 / 7 (not integer)
81 / 63 (not integer)

What if 7 is divided by something?
7 / 81 (not integer)
7 / 63 (not integer)

This confirms that the only integer division possible is 63 / 7.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: 81 - 7 - 63.
This uses 81, 7, 63 exactly once.
It uses subtraction twice, which is allowed.
The calculation is 81 - 7 = 74, then 74 - 63 = 11.
This is a valid solution.

Let's consider the structure a op1 (b op2 c).
*   81 - (7 + 63) = 81 - 70 = 11.

4193,1263,"<think>The problem asks me to use the numbers 76, 15, and 92 exactly once, along with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to reach the target value of 31.

Let's list the numbers: [76, 15, 92]
Target: 31

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /

Let's start by trying to combine two numbers and then use the third.

Attempt 1: Start with 76 and 15.
76 + 15 = 91. Then use 92. 91 + 92 = 183 (too high). 91 - 92 = -1 (too low). 92 - 91 = 1 (too low). 91 * 92 (way too high). 91 / 92 (fraction).
76 - 15 = 61. Then use 92. 61 + 92 = 153 (too high). 92 - 61 = 31. This looks promising!
Let's check the order: (76 - 15) = 61. Then 92 - 61 = 31.
This uses 76, 15, and 92 exactly once. The operations are subtraction and subtraction.
The equation would be 92 - (76 - 15) = 31.

Let's verify this:
76 - 15 = 61
92 - 61 = 31
This works.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or to see if there are alternatives.

Attempt 2: Start with 76 and 92.
76 + 92 = 168. Use 15. 168 - 15 = 153. 168 + 15 = 183.
76 - 92 = -16. Use 15. -16 + 15 = -1. 15 - (-16) = 31. This is another possibility!
Let's check the order: (76 - 92) = -16. Then 15 - (-16) = 15 + 16 = 31.
The equation would be 15 - (76 - 92) = 31.

Let's verify this:
76 - 92 = -16
15 - (-16) = 15 + 16 = 31
This also works.

Attempt 3: Start with 15 and 92.
15 + 92 = 107. Use 76. 107 - 76 = 31. This is another possibility!
Let's check the order: (15 + 92) = 107. Then 107 - 76 = 31.
The equation would be (15 + 92) - 76 = 31.

Let's verify this:
15 + 92 = 107
107 - 76 = 31
This also works.

15 - 92 = -77. Use 76. -77 + 76 = -1. 76 - (-77) = 153.
92 - 15 = 77. Use 76. 77 - 76 = 1. 76 - 77 = -1.
15 * 92 (too high).
92 / 15 (fraction).

Let's consider multiplication and division.
Can we get a number close to 31 by multiplying or dividing?
76 / 15 (fraction)
76 / 92 (fraction)
15 / 76 (fraction)
15 / 92 (fraction)
92 / 76 (fraction)
92 / 15 (fraction)

What if we multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the third?
76 * 15 = 1140 (too high)
76 * 92 (too high)
15 * 92 (too high)

What if we divide first?
Let's try to get a smaller number first.
Maybe division is not the primary operation here.

Let's re-examine the successful attempts:
1. 92 - (76 - 15) = 31
2. 15 - (76 - 92) = 31
3. (15 + 92) - 76 = 31

All three are valid solutions. The problem asks for ""the final equation"". I can present any one of them. The first one I found was 92 - (76 - 15) = 31. The third one, (15 + 92) - 76 = 31, seems simpler as it only uses addition and subtraction in a straightforward way.

Let's double check the constraints:
- Use numbers [76, 15, 92] exactly once. (Checked)
- Use only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. (Checked)
- Arrive at target value of 31. (Checked)
- Show reasoning and intermediate steps within <think></think> tags. (Done)
- Final equation strictly within <answer></answer> tags. (Will do)

I will choose the third solution as it's quite direct.
(15 + 92) - 76 = 31
15 + 92 = 107
107 - 76 = 31.

Another option is 76 - (92 - 15) = 76 - 77 = -1 (doesn't work)
How about 76 - 15 + 92 = 61 + 92 = 153 (doesn't work)
How about 76 + 15 - 92 = 91 - 92 = -1 (doesn't work)
How about 92 + 15 - 76 = 107 - 76 = 31 (This is the same as (15+92)-76)
How about 92 - 15 + 76 = 77 + 76 = 153 (doesn't work)
How about 92 - 76 + 15 = 16 + 15 = 31. This is another one!
Let's verify: 92 - 76 = 16. 16 + 15 = 31.
Equation: 92 - 76 + 15 = 31.

So, I have found:
1. 92 - (76 - 15) = 31
2. 15 - (76 - 92) = 31
3. (15 + 92) - 76 = 31
4. 92 - 76 + 15 = 31

All are valid. I will pick one to present. The last one, 92 - 76 + 15 = 31, is also very straightforward.

Let's consider if multiplication or division could be involved in a less obvious way.
For example, could we get 31 by multiplying something by 1?
Or dividing something to get 31?
If we divide 92 by something, it's unlikely to be an integer that helps.
If we divide 76 by something, also unlikely.
If we divide 15 by something, also unlikely.

What if we create 1?
(76 - 15) / ? = 61 / ?
(92 - 76) / ? = 16 / ?
(92 - 15) / ? = 77 / ?

What if we create a number that, when multiplied by one of the given numbers, gets us closer?
For example, if we could make 1/2, and multiply by 76, we get 38. Then use 15 and 92.
(15 / ?) * 76 ...

Let's stick to the simpler solutions found. The problem doesn't require finding all solutions, just one.
I will present 92 - 76 + 15 = 31.
It uses 92, 76, 15 exactly once.
It uses subtraction and addition.
It results in 31.
The order of operations is standard (left to right for subtraction and addition).
92 - 76 = 16
16 + 15 = 31.
This is a valid and clear solution.

766,1476,"<think>The user wants an equation using the numbers 26, 56, and 24 exactly once, resulting in 58. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try combining the numbers in different ways.

1.  **Start with the largest number (56) and see if I can adjust it.**
    *   56 + 26 = 82. Need to subtract 24. 82 - 24 = 58. This works!

Let's verify:
Numbers used: 56, 26, 24. All used exactly once.
Operations used: +, -. Basic operations.
Result: 58. Correct.

So the equation is 56 + 26 - 24 = 58.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be thorough, though the first one is simple and correct.

2.  **Try multiplication first.**
    *   26 * 24 is too large.
    *   26 * 56 is too large.
    *   56 * 24 is too large.

3.  **Try division.**
    *   56 / 26 is not a whole number.
    *   56 / 24 is not a whole number.
    *   26 / 56 is not a whole number.
    *   24 / 56 is not a whole number.
    *   26 / 24 is not a whole number.
    *   24 / 26 is not a whole number.

4.  **Combine multiplication and addition/subtraction.**
    *   (26 * 2) + 6? No, I need to use the numbers 26, 56, 24.
    *   Let's try grouping:
        *   (56 - 24) + 26 = 32 + 26 = 58. This also works!
        *   Numbers used: 56, 24, 26. All used exactly once.
        *   Operations used: -, +. Basic operations.
        *   Result: 58. Correct.

        *   (56 + 24) - 26 = 80 - 26 = 54. Not 58.
        *   (26 + 24) + 56 = 50 + 56 = 106. Not 58.
        *   (26 + 24) - 56 = 50 - 56 = -6. Not 58.
        *   (56 * 2) + 6? No, need to use the given numbers.

The first solution found, 56 + 26 - 24 = 58, is the most straightforward. The second solution, (56 - 24) + 26 = 58, is also valid. I will provide the first one as it's simpler.

The user wants me to find a mathematical expression using the numbers 63, 84, and 6, and the operations +, -, *, /, to reach the target value of 15. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [63, 84, 6]
Target: 15

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c
2. a op (b op c)

Let's try combining 63 and 84 first.
- 63 + 84 = 147. Then 147 op 6.
    - 147 + 6 = 153 (too high)
    - 147 - 6 = 141 (too high)
    - 147 * 6 = 882 (too high)
    - 147 / 6 = 24.5 (not an integer, unlikely to reach 15)
- 63 - 84 = -21. Then -21 op 6.
    - -21 + 6 = -15 (close, but negative)
    - -21 - 6 = -27 (too low)
    - -21 * 6 = -126 (too low)
    - -21 / 6 = -3.5 (not an integer)
- 84 - 63 = 21. Then 21 op 6.
    - 21 + 6 = 27 (too high)
    - 21 - 6 = 15 (Exactly the target! This looks promising.)
    - 21 * 6 = 126 (too high)
    - 21 / 6 = 3.5 (not an integer)

So, (84 - 63) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15.
This uses 84, 63, and 6 exactly once, and only uses subtraction. This is a valid solution.

Let's double check other combinations just to be thorough.

Try combining 63 and 6 first.
- 63 + 6 = 69. Then 69 op 84.
    - 69 + 84 = 153
    - 69 - 84 = -15
    - 84 - 69 = 15 (This is another potential solution: 84 - (63 + 6) = 84 - 69 = 15)
    - 69 * 84 = large
    - 69 / 84 = fraction
- 63 - 6 = 57. Then 57 op 84.
    - 57 + 84 = 141
    - 57 - 84 = -27
    - 84 - 57 = 27
    - 57 * 84 = large
    - 57 / 84 = fraction
- 63 * 6 = 378. Then 378 op 84.
    - 378 + 84 = large
    - 378 - 84 = 294
    - 84 - 378 = negative
    - 378 / 84 = fraction
- 63 / 6 = 10.5 (not integer)

Try combining 84 and 6 first.
- 84 + 6 = 90. Then 90 op 63.
    - 90 + 63 = 153
    - 90 - 63 = 27
    - 63 - 90 = -27
    - 90 * 63 = large
    - 90 / 63 = fraction
- 84 - 6 = 78. Then 78 op 63.
    - 78 + 63 = 141
    - 78 - 63 = 15 (This is another potential solution: (84 - 6) - 63 = 78 - 63 = 15)
    - 63 - 78 = -15
    - 78 * 63 = large
    - 78 / 63 = fraction
- 84 * 6 = 504. Then 504 op 63.
    - 504 + 63 = large
    - 504 - 63 = 441
    - 63 - 504 = negative
    - 504 / 63 = 8 (not 15)
- 84 / 6 = 14. Then 14 op 63.
    - 14 + 63 = 77
    - 14 - 63 = -49
    - 63 - 14 = 49
    - 14 * 63 = large
    - 14 / 63 = fraction

So far, I have found three potential solutions:
1. (84 - 63) - 6 = 15
2. 84 - (63 + 6) = 15
3. (84 - 6) - 63 = 15

All three are valid. I will present the first one I found as it's the simplest structure.
(84 - 63) - 6
Step 1: 84 - 63 = 21
Step 2: 21 - 6 = 15
This uses 84, 63, and 6 exactly once. It uses only subtraction. The result is 15.

Let's verify the second one:
84 - (63 + 6)
Step 1: 63 + 6 = 69
Step 2: 84 - 69 = 15
This uses 84, 63, and 6 exactly once. It uses addition and subtraction. The result is 15.

Let's verify the third one:
(84 - 6) - 63
Step 1: 84 - 6 = 78
Step 2: 78 - 63 = 15
This uses 84, 6, and 63 exactly once. It uses only subtraction. The result is 15.

I will choose the first one as it's the most straightforward.
(84 - 63) - 6 = 15

The user wants an equation using the numbers 3, 19, and 44, with the result being 21.
I can only use +, -, *, /.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [3, 19, 44]
Target result: 21

I need to try different combinations of operations and number order.

Possible structures:
1. (a op b) op c = 21
2. a op (b op c) = 21

Let's try combinations with 44 first, as it's the largest number.

Possibility 1: Start with 44.
- 44 + 19 + 3 = 66 (Too high)
- 44 + 19 - 3 = 60 (Too high)
- 44 - 19 + 3 = 25 + 3 = 28 (Close, but not 21)
- 44 - 19 - 3 = 25 - 3 = 22 (Very close!)
- 44 * 19 ... (Too high)
- 44 / 19 ... (Not an integer, unlikely to lead to 21 easily)
- 44 + 3 - 19 = 47 - 19 = 28 (Same as 44 - 19 + 3)
- 44 - 3 + 19 = 41 + 19 = 60 (Same as 44 + 19 - 3)
- 44 - 3 - 19 = 41 - 19 = 22 (Same as 44 - 19 - 3)

Let's re-examine 44 - 19 - 3 = 22. This is very close to 21.
Can I rearrange or change operations slightly?

What if 19 is involved in a multiplication or division that reduces its value or the overall value?

Let's try combinations where 19 is not the first number.

Possibility 2: Start with 19.
- 19 + 44 + 3 = 66
- 19 + 44 - 3 = 60
- 19 - 44 ... (Negative, unlikely)
- 19 * 3 = 57. Then use 44.
    - 57 + 44 = 101
    - 57 - 44 = 13 (Not 21)
    - 44 - 57 = -13
    - 57 / 44 (Not integer)
- 19 * 44 ... (Too high)
- 19 / 3 ... (Not integer)
- 19 + 3 = 22. Then use 44.
    - 22 + 44 = 66
    - 22 - 44 = -22
    - 44 - 22 = 22 (Close!)
    - 22 * 44 (Too high)
    - 22 / 44 (Fraction)
- 19 - 3 = 16. Then use 44.
    - 16 + 44 = 60
    - 16 - 44 = -28
    - 44 - 16 = 28 (Close!)
    - 16 * 44 (Too high)
    - 16 / 44 (Fraction)

Possibility 3: Start with 3.
- 3 + 19 + 44 = 66
- 3 + 19 - 44 = 22 - 44 = -22
- 3 - 19 + 44 = -16 + 44 = 28 (Close!)
- 3 - 19 - 44 = -16 - 44 = -60
- 3 * 19 = 57. Then use 44.
    - 57 + 44 = 101
    - 57 - 44 = 13
    - 44 - 57 = -13
- 3 * 44 = 132. Then use 19.
    - 132 + 19 = 151
    - 132 - 19 = 113
    - 19 - 132 = -113
- 3 / 19 (Fraction)
- 3 / 44 (Fraction)

Let's go back to the close results:
- 44 - 19 - 3 = 22
- 44 - 3 - 19 = 22
- 3 - 19 + 44 = 28
- 44 - 16 = 28 (where 16 = 19-3) -> 44 - (19-3) = 44 - 16 = 28. This is 44 - 19 + 3.
- 44 - 22 = 22 (where 22 = 19+3) -> 44 - (19+3) = 44 - 22 = 22. This is 44 - 19 - 3.

We need 21.
The result 22 is very close. How can we get 1 less?

Consider the expression (44 - 19 - 3). This gives 22.
If we could somehow subtract 1 from this, we'd get 21. But we've used all numbers.

Let's try division.
What if we divide one number by another to get a small number to add or subtract?
- 44 / ?
- 19 / ?
- 3 / ?

Consider the structure (a op b) / c or a / (b op c).
- (44 - 3) / 19 = 41 / 19 (Not integer)
- (44 + 3) / 19 = 47 / 19 (Not integer)
- (19 - 3) / 44 = 16 / 44 (Fraction)
- (19 + 3) / 44 = 22 / 44 = 0.5 (Not integer)
- (44 - 19) / 3 = 25 / 3 (Not integer)
- (44 + 19) / 3 = 63 / 3 = 21.
This looks promising!
The numbers used are 44, 19, and 3.
The operations are +, -, /.
The equation is (44 + 19) / 3.
Let's check:
44 + 19 = 63
63 / 3 = 21.

This uses all numbers [3, 19, 44] exactly once.
It uses only allowed operations (+, /).
The result is 21.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough.
What about multiplication leading to a number that can be divided?
- 3 * 19 = 57. Then use 44.
    - (57 - 44) / ? No other number.
    - (44 - 57) / ? No other number.
- 3 * 44 = 132. Then use 19.
    - (132 - 19) / ? No other number.
    - (19 - 132) / ? No other number.
- 19 * 44 ... too big.

What about division first?
- 44 / ?
- 19 / ?
- 3 / ?

Let's consider the structure a * b + c or a * b - c.
- 3 * 19 + 44 = 57 + 44 = 101

- 19 * 3 + 44 = 57 + 44 = 101
- 19 * 3 - 44 = 57 - 44 = 13
- 19 * 44 ... too big.

(93 + 10) = 103. Remaining: 31, 72. Can I get 3 from 31 and 72?
72 / 31 is not integer.
31 / 72 is not integer.
72 - 31 = 41.
31 - 72 = -41.

What if I try to make 100 directly?
Maybe 72 + 31 - 3 = 100. How to get 3 from 93 and 10?
93 / 10 is not integer.
10 / 93 is not integer.
93 - 10 = 83.
10 - 93 = -83.

Let's try another combination.
(72 + 10) = 82. Remaining: 93, 31. Need 18.
93 - 31 = 62. No.

How about (93 - 31) = 62. Remaining: 10, 72. Need 38.
72 - 10 = 62. No.

Let's try multiplication with one of the numbers.
If I multiply 10 by something, I get a number ending in 0.
If I multiply 31 by something, it's harder to predict.
If I multiply 72 by something, it's harder to predict.
If I multiply 93 by something, it's harder to predict.

Let's try to get a number that, when added to 93, gives 100. That number is 7.
Can I get 7 from 31, 10, 72?
72 / 10 is not integer.
31 - 10 = 21. 72 / 21 is not integer.
72 - 31 = 41.
31 + 10 = 41.

Let's try to get a number that, when subtracted from 93, gives 100. That number is -7.
Can I get -7 from 31, 10, 72?
10 - 31 = -21.

10 - 72 = -62.

Let's try to get a number that, when added to 72, gives 100. That number is 28.
Can I get 28 from 93, 31, 10?
93 - (31 + 10) = 93 - 41 = 52. No.
93 - 31 - 10 = 52. No.
93 - 10 - 31 = 52. No.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 88, 17, and 94 to reach the target number 23.
I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [88, 17, 94]
Target: 23

I need to combine these three numbers using the four basic operations.
There are 3! = 6 possible permutations of the numbers.
For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each operation has 4 choices. So, 4^3 = 64 combinations of operations for each permutation.
This is a manageable number to explore systematically.

Let's try different combinations.

Permutation 1: 88, 17, 94
- (88 + 17) + 94 = 105 + 94 = 199 (Too high)
- (88 + 17) - 94 = 105 - 94 = 11 (Too low)
- (88 + 17) * 94 = 105 * 94 (Too high)
- (88 + 17) / 94 = 105 / 94 (Not an integer, unlikely to reach 23)

- (88 - 17) + 94 = 71 + 94 = 165 (Too high)
- (88 - 17) - 94 = 71 - 94 = -23 (Close, but negative)
- (88 - 17) * 94 = 71 * 94 (Too high)
- (88 - 17) / 94 = 71 / 94 (Not an integer)

- (88 * 17) + 94 = 1496 + 94 = 1590 (Too high)
- (88 * 17) - 94 = 1496 - 94 = 1402 (Too high)
- (88 * 17) / 94 = 1496 / 94 = 15.91... (Not an integer)

- (88 / 17) + 94 = 5.17... + 94 (Not an integer)
- (88 / 17) - 94 = 5.17... - 94 (Not an integer)
- (88 / 17) * 94 = 5.17... * 94 (Not an integer)

Let's try operations in a different order or with parentheses.

Consider 88 and 94 first.
- 94 - 88 = 6. Then combine with 17.
  - 6 + 17 = 23. This works!
  - The equation is (94 - 88) + 17 = 6 + 17 = 23.
  - Numbers used: 94, 88, 17. All used once.
  - Operations used: -, +. Basic operations.
  - Result: 23.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities just to be thorough.

Permutation 2: 88, 94, 17
- (88 + 94) + 17 = 182 + 17 = 199
- (88 + 94) - 17 = 182 - 17 = 165
- (88 - 94) + 17 = -6 + 17 = 11
- (88 - 94) - 17 = -6 - 17 = -23
- (94 - 88) + 17 = 6 + 17 = 23. Found it again.

Permutation 3: 17, 88, 94
- (17 + 88) + 94 = 105 + 94 = 199
- (17 + 88) - 94 = 105 - 94 = 11
- (88 - 17) + 94 = 71 + 94 = 165
- (94 - 17) + 88 = 77 + 88 = 165
- (94 - 88) + 17 = 6 + 17 = 23. Found it again.

Permutation 4: 17, 94, 88
- (94 - 17) + 88 = 77 + 88 = 165
- (94 - 17) - 88 = 77 - 88 = -11
- (88 - 17) + 94 = 71 + 94 = 165
- (88 - 94) + 17 = -6 + 17 = 11

Permutation 5: 94, 17, 88
- (94 - 17) + 88 = 77 + 88 = 165
- (94 - 17) - 88 = 77 - 88 = -11
- (94 + 17) - 88 = 111 - 88 = 23. This is another solution!
  - The equation is (94 + 17) - 88 = 111 - 88 = 23.
  - Numbers used: 94, 17, 88. All used once.
  - Operations used: +, -. Basic operations.
  - Result: 23.

Permutation 6: 94, 88, 17
- (94 - 88) + 17 = 6 + 17 = 23. Found it again.
- (94 + 88) - 17 = 182 - 17 = 165

So I have found two valid equations:
1. (94 - 88) + 17 = 23
2. (94 + 17) - 88 = 23

The prompt asks for ""an equation"". I will present one of them. The first one seems slightly simpler.

Let's verify the first one: (94 - 88) + 17
Numbers: 94, 88, 17 (all used once)
Operations: -, + (basic operations)
Calculation: 94 - 88 = 6. Then 6 + 17 = 23.
Result: 23 (target achieved)

Let's verify the second one: (94 + 17) - 88
Numbers: 94, 17, 88 (all used once)
Operations: +, - (basic operations)
Calculation: 94 + 17 = 111. Then 111 - 88 = 23.
Result: 23 (target achieved)

Both are valid. I will choose the first one.
(94 - 88) + 17 = 23.
The order of operations is clear with parentheses.
The numbers 88, 17, 94 are all used exactly once.
The operations are subtraction and addition.
The result is 23.
This fits all criteria.

5407,1375,"<think>The target is 72. The numbers are 13, 17, 72, and 54.
I need to use each number exactly once with +, -, *, /.

Let's look at the numbers. We have 72 itself. This is a strong hint.
If 72 is part of the equation, it could be:
1. The result of an operation involving the other numbers, and then combined with 72.
2. 72 itself is the final result, meaning the other numbers must combine to 0, or be used in a way that doesn't change the 72.

Let's explore option 2 first, as it seems simpler.
If 72 is the final number, then the other numbers (13, 17, 54) must somehow result in 0 when combined with 72, or be part of an expression that evaluates to 72.

Possibility 2a: The other numbers combine to 0.
Can 13, 17, 54 combine to 0?
13 + 17 + 54 = 84 (No)
13 + 17 - 54 = -24 (No)
13 - 17 + 54 = 50 (No)
13 - 17 - 54 = -58 (No)
17 - 13 + 54 = 58 (No)
17 - 13 - 54 = -50 (No)
54 - 13 - 17 = 24 (No)
54 - 17 - 13 = 24 (No)
Multiplication and division are unlikely to result in 0 unless one of the numbers is 0, which is not the case.
So, combining 13, 17, 54 to 0 is not straightforward.

Possibility 2b: The expression results in 72.
Let's try to incorporate 72 directly.
If we have `... + 72`, then the rest must equal 0. We already explored this.
If we have `... - 72`, then the rest must equal 144. (13, 17, 54) -> 144?
13 * 17 = 221 (too big)
54 * 13 = 702 (too big)
54 * 17 = 918 (too big)
54 + 13 + 17 = 84 (No)
54 * (17 - 13) = 54 * 4 = 216 (No)
(54 + 13) * 17 = 67 * 17 = 1139 (No)
(54 + 17) * 13 = 71 * 13 = 923 (No)
(54 - 13) * 17 = 41 * 17 = 697 (No)
(54 - 17) * 13 = 37 * 13 = 481 (No)
This path seems difficult.

If we have `... * 72`, then the rest must equal 1.
Can 13, 17, 54 combine to 1?
13 / 13 = 1. But we have 17 and 54 left.
(17 - 13) / 4 = 1. But we have 54 left.
(54 / 54) = 1. But we have 13 and 17 left.
This is also unlikely.

If we have `... / 72`, then the rest must equal 72 * 72 = 5184.
Can 13, 17, 54 combine to 5184? Highly unlikely with only 3 numbers and basic operations.

Let's reconsider option 1: The result of an operation involving the other numbers, and then combined with 72.
This means 72 is not the final number in the expression, but one of the operands.

Let's try to make a number close to 72 using some of the numbers, and then adjust with the remaining ones.
Numbers: 13, 17, 72, 54. Target: 72.

What if we use 54 and 17?
54 + 17 = 71. Close to 72. We have 13 and 72 left.
(54 + 17) + 13 = 84. Then we have 72 left. 84 + 72 = 156. 84 - 72 = 12. 84 * 72 (too big). 84 / 72 (fraction).
(54 + 17) - 13 = 58. Then we have 72 left. 58 + 72 = 130. 58 - 72 = -14.
(54 + 17) * 13 = 71 * 13 = 923. Then we have 72 left.

What if we use 54 and 13?
54 + 13 = 67. We have 17 and 72 left.
67 + 17 = 84. Then 72. 84 + 72 = 156. 84 - 72 = 12.
67 - 17 = 50. Then 72. 50 + 72 = 122. 50 - 72 = -22.
67 * 17 = 1139. Then 72.

What if we use 17 and 13?
17 + 13 = 30. We have 72 and 54 left.
30 + 72 = 102. Then 54. 102 + 54 = 156. 102 - 54 = 48.
30 * 72 = 2160. Then 54.

Let's try to create 72 using multiplication.
We have 72. Can we make 1 using the other numbers?
13, 17, 54. No easy way to make 1.

Let's try to make a number that, when combined with one of the given numbers, results in 72.
Example: `X + Y = 72`.
If Y = 54, X must be 18. Can 13, 17, 72 make 18?
17 - 13 = 4. Then 72. 72 / 4 = 18.
So, we have (72 / (17 - 13)) = 18.
We used 72, 17, 13. We have 54 left.
The equation would be (72 / (17 - 13)) + 54 = 18 + 54 = 72.
This uses all numbers: 72, 17, 13, 54.
It uses +, -, /.
The result is 72.

Let's double check the operations and numbers used.
Numbers: 13, 17, 72, 54.
Equation: (72 / (17 - 13)) + 54
Numbers used: 72, 17, 13, 54. All used exactly once.
Operations used: /, -, +. All allowed.
Calculation:
17 - 13 = 4
72 / 4 = 18
18 + 54 = 72.
The result is 72.

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.
What if we try to make 72 using 54 and 18?
We need to make 18 from 13, 17, 72.
We found 72 / (17 - 13) = 18. This led to the solution above.

What if we try to make 72 using 13 and X?
X = 72 - 13 = 59. Can 17, 72, 54 make 59?
54 + 17 = 71. Close. 71 - 72 = -1.
72 - 17 = 55. Close. 55 + 54 = 109. 55 - 54 = 1.

Let's try combinations with 48 first, as it's the largest number and likely involved in getting close to 42.

Possibility 1: Using 48 and 2.

The numbers used are 48, 2, and 4. The operations are - and -.
The equation would be (48 - 2) - 4 = 46 - 4 = 42.
This uses all numbers (48, 2, 4) exactly once and only subtraction.

The numbers used are 48, 4, and 2. The operations are - and -.
The equation would be (48 - 4) - 2 = 44 - 2 = 42.
This also uses all numbers (48, 4, 2) exactly once and only subtraction.

Possibility 3: Using multiplication.
- 48 * 2 = 96. Need to get from 96 to 42 using 4. 96 / 4 = 24. Not 42. 96 - 4 = 92. Not 42.

- Result: 42. Yes.

The reasoning is to systematically try combinations of the given numbers with the allowed operations, aiming to reach the target number. Starting with the largest number (48) and combining it with others often helps narrow down possibilities. In this case, subtraction proved to be the most direct path.

Step 1: Identify the numbers [4, 2, 48] and the target value 42.
Step 2: Consider combinations involving the largest number, 48.
Step 3: Try subtracting the other numbers from 48.
Step 4: Calculate 48 - 4 = 44.
Step 5: Use the remaining number, 2, with the result from Step 4. 44 - 2 = 42.
Step 6: This yields the equation (48 - 4) - 2 = 42.
Step 7: Verify that all numbers (48, 4, 2) are used exactly once and only allowed operations are used. This is satisfied.

Alternatively:
Step 4: Calculate 48 - 2 = 46.
Step 5: Use the remaining number, 4, with the result from Step 4. 46 - 4 = 42.
Step 6: This yields the equation (48 - 2) - 4 = 42.
Step 7: Verify that all numbers (48, 2, 4) are used exactly once and only allowed operations are used. This is satisfied.

I will present the first one I found: (48 - 2) - 4.

I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's try some combinations:

1.  (67 + 37) - 89 = 104 - 89 = 15 (Too low)
2.  (67 - 37) + 89 = 30 + 89 = 119 (Too high)
3.  (67 * 37) - 89 = 2479 - 89 = 2390 (Too high)
4.  (67 / 37) ... this will result in a fraction, unlikely to reach 59 with integers.
5.  (37 + 89) - 67 = 126 - 67 = 59 (This works!)
6.  (37 - 89) + 67 = -52 + 67 = 15 (Too low)
7.  (89 - 37) + 67 = 52 + 67 = 119 (Too high)
8.  (89 + 67) - 37 = 156 - 37 = 119 (Too high)
9.  89 - (67 - 37) = 89 - 30 = 59 (This also works!)
10. 89 - (37 - 67) = 89 - (-30) = 89 + 30 = 119 (Too high)
11. 67 + (89 - 37) = 67 + 52 = 119 (Too high)
12. 67 - (89 - 37) = 67 - 52 = 15 (Too low)
13. 37 + (89 - 67) = 37 + 22 = 59 (This also works!)
14. 37 - (89 - 67) = 37 - 22 = 15 (Too low)

I have found three valid equations:
*   (37 + 89) - 67 = 59
*   89 - (67 - 37) = 59
*   37 + (89 - 67) = 59

I will choose one of them. The first one is straightforward.

331,512,"<think>The problem requires me to find an equation that uses the numbers 1, 85, and 98 exactly once, along with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to produce a result of 12.

Let the three numbers be $n_1 = 1$, $n_2 = 85$, and $n_3 = 98$.
The target result is $R = 12$.
The allowed operations are $+$, $-$, $*$, $/$.

I need to arrange these numbers and operations in a valid mathematical expression. Since there are only three numbers, the structure of the expression will be relatively simple. The possible structures are:
1. $(n_a \text{ op1 } n_b) \text{ op2 } n_c$
2. $n_a \text{ op1 } (n_b \text{ op2 } n_c)$

Let's consider the numbers and the target. We have a large number (98) and a moderately large number (85), and a small number (1). The target (12) is relatively small. This suggests that division or subtraction will likely be involved to reduce the magnitude of the numbers.

Let's list the possible permutations of the numbers (1, 85, 98) and the possible operations.

**Permutations of numbers:**
* (1, 85, 98)
* (1, 98, 85)
* (85, 1, 98)
* (85, 98, 1)
* (98, 1, 85)
* (98, 85, 1)

**Possible operations combinations:**
For each permutation, we can have 4 choices for op1 and 4 choices for op2, leading to $4 \times 4 = 16$ combinations of operations for each structure.

Let's try to combine the numbers strategically.

**Strategy 1: Start with the largest numbers and try to reduce them.**

Consider the pair (98, 85).
* $98 + 85 = 183$ (Too large)
* $98 - 85 = 13$ (Close to 12!)
* $85 - 98 = -13$
* $98 \times 85$ (Very large)
* $98 / 85$ (Not an integer, likely not useful unless combined with multiplication later)
* $85 / 98$ (Not an integer)

Let's focus on $98 - 85 = 13$. We still have the number 1 to use.
We need to combine 13 with 1 to get 12.
* $13 + 1 = 14$ (Close)
* $13 - 1 = 12$ (Exactly what we need!)
* $13 \times 1 = 13$
* $13 / 1 = 13$

So, if we can form $98 - 85$ first, and then subtract 1, we get 12.
The expression would be $(98 - 85) - 1$.
Let's check if this uses all numbers exactly once: Yes, 98, 85, and 1 are used.
Let's check if this uses only allowed operations: Yes, subtraction is used.
Let's check the result: $(98 - 85) - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12$. This works!

This seems like a valid solution. Let's explore other possibilities to be thorough, but this one is straightforward.

**Strategy 2: Try division.**

If we use division, we need to be careful about getting integer results or setting up a situation where the final result is an integer.

Consider dividing 98 by something.
* $98 / 1 = 98$. Then we have 85. $98 \text{ op } 85$. $98-85=13$, $98+85=183$. Not 12.
* $98 / 85$ (Not integer)

Consider dividing 85 by something.
* $85 / 1 = 85$. Then we have 98. $85 \text{ op } 98$. $85-98=-13$, $85+98=183$. Not 12.

Consider dividing 1 by something. This will result in a fraction unless the divisor is 1.

Let's try to create a number that divides nicely into 98 or 85.
For example, can we make 2, 7, 14, 49 from the other numbers?
* Can we make 2 from (1, 85)? No.
* Can we make 7 from (1, 85)? No.
* Can we make 14 from (1, 85)? No.
* Can we make 49 from (1, 85)? No.

What if we divide a combination?
For example, $(85+1) / ?$ or $(98+1) / ?$ or $(98-1) / ?$ or $(85-1) / ?$

Let's try to make a denominator that works with 98. Divisors of 98 are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.
Can we make 2 from (1, 85)? No.
Can we make 7 from (1, 85)? No.
Can we make 14 from (1, 85)? No.
Can we make 49 from (1, 85)? No.

Let's try to make a denominator that works with 85. Divisors of 85 are 1, 5, 17, 85.
Can we make 5 from (1, 98)? No.
Can we make 17 from (1, 98)? No.

What if we use multiplication to create a larger number and then divide?
For example, $1 \times 85 = 85$. Then we have 98. $85 \text{ op } 98$. Not 12.
$1 \times 98 = 98$. Then we have 85. $98 \text{ op } 85$. Not 12.
$85 \times 98$ (Too large)

Let's consider the structure $n_a \text{ op1 } (n_b \text{ op2 } n_c)$.

Try permutations:
1. (1, 85, 98)
   * $1 + (85 + 98) = 184$
   * $1 + (85 - 98) = 1 + (-13) = -12$
   * $1 + (98 - 85) = 1 + 13 = 14$
   * $1 - (85 + 98) = 1 - 183 = -182$
   * $1 - (85 - 98) = 1 - (-13) = 14$
   * $1 - (98 - 85) = 1 - 13 = -12$
   * $1 \times (85 + 98) = 183$
   * $1 \times (98 - 85) = 13$
   * $1 / (85 + 98)$ (fraction)
   * $1 / (98 - 85) = 1/13$ (fraction)
   * $(85+98)/1 = 183$
   * $(98-85)/1 = 13$

2. (85, 1, 98)
   * $85 + (1 + 98) = 184$
   * $85 + (1 - 98) = 85 - 97 = -12$
   * $85 + (98 - 1) = 85 + 97 = 182$
   * $85 - (1 + 98) = 85 - 99 = -14$
   * $85 - (98 - 1) = 85 - 97 = -12$
   * $85 \times (98 - 1) = 85 \times 97$ (large)
   * $(98-1)/85 = 97/85$ (fraction)

17. 29 / (83 - 76) = 29 / 7 (Fraction)

Let's check the ones that worked:
*   (83 - 76) + 29 = 7 + 29 = 36. Uses 83, 76, 29 exactly once. Uses +, -. Reaches 36.
*   83 - (76 - 29) = 83 - 47 = 36. Uses 83, 76, 29 exactly once. Uses -. Reaches 36.
*   29 + (83 - 76) = 29 + 7 = 36. Uses 29, 83, 76 exactly once. Uses +, -. Reaches 36.

All three are valid. I'll pick one. (83 - 76) + 29 seems straightforward.

Let's double check the rules:
- Use [83 76 29]: Yes, all used.
- Exactly once: Yes.

- Reach 36: Yes.

I need to combine these four numbers using the four basic arithmetic operations. I'll try different groupings and orders of operations.

Possible strategies:
1. Start with the largest numbers and see if I can adjust them.
2. Try to create numbers close to 81 and then use the remaining numbers to adjust.
3. Consider the properties of the numbers (e.g., divisibility).

Let's try combining 80 and 2 first.
80 + 2 = 82. I need to get to 81 using 30 and 30.

Possible first operations:

The expression was (77 - (76 - 62)) - 11.
This uses 77, 76, 62, 11.

3929,364,"<think>The user wants me to use the numbers 45, 3, and 21 exactly once with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target number 18.

I need to explore different combinations and operations.

Let's list the numbers: 45, 3, 21.
Target: 18.

Possible operations: +, -, *, /.

Let's try combining two numbers first and then incorporating the third.

1.  **Combine 45 and 3:**
    *   45 + 3 = 48. Now I need to use 21 to get 18. 48 - 21 = 27 (not 18). 48 / 21 (not an integer). 48 * 21 (too large).
    *   45 - 3 = 42. Now I need to use 21 to get 18. 42 - 21 = 21 (not 18). 42 / 21 = 2 (not 18). 42 + 21 = 63 (not 18). 42 * 21 (too large).
    *   45 * 3 = 135. Now I need to use 21 to get 18. 135 - 21 = 114 (not 18). 135 / 21 (not an integer). 135 + 21 (too large).
    *   45 / 3 = 15. Now I need to use 21 to get 18. 15 + 21 = 36 (not 18). 15 - 21 = -6 (not 18). 21 - 15 = 6 (not 18). 15 * 21 (too large).

2.  **Combine 45 and 21:**
    *   45 + 21 = 66. Now I need to use 3 to get 18. 66 - 3 = 63 (not 18). 66 / 3 = 22 (not 18). 66 * 3 (too large).
    *   45 - 21 = 24. Now I need to use 3 to get 18. 24 - 3 = 21 (not 18). 24 / 3 = 8 (not 18). 24 + 3 = 27 (not 18). 24 * 3 (too large).
    *   21 - 45 = -24. Now I need to use 3 to get 18. -24 + 3 = -21 (not 18). -24 - 3 = -27 (not 18). -24 * 3 (too large). -24 / 3 = -8 (not 18).
    *   45 * 21 (too large).
    *   45 / 21 (not an integer).
    *   21 / 45 (not an integer).

3.  **Combine 3 and 21:**
    *   3 + 21 = 24. Now I need to use 45 to get 18. 45 - 24 = 21 (not 18). 24 - 45 = -21 (not 18). 45 + 24 (too large). 45 / 24 (not integer). 24 / 45 (not integer).
    *   21 - 3 = 18. Now I need to use 45 to get 18. This looks promising! I have 18, and I need to use 45. How can I use 45 without changing the value 18? I can add 0 or multiply by 1.
        *   Can I make 0 from 45? No, not with just 45.
        *   Can I make 1 from 45? No, not with just 45.
        *   So, the structure (21 - 3) needs to be combined with 45.
        *   Let's try (21 - 3) + 45 = 18 + 45 = 63 (not 18).

        *   Let's try 45 - (21 - 3) = 45 - 18 = 27 (not 18).
        *   Let's try (21 - 3) * 45 = 18 * 45 (too large).
        *   Let's try (21 - 3) / 45 = 18 / 45 (not integer).
        *   Let's try 45 / (21 - 3) = 45 / 18 (not integer).

    *   3 - 21 = -18. Now I need to use 45 to get 18. 45 + (-18) = 27 (not 18). 45 - (-18) = 45 + 18 = 63 (not 18). -18 + 45 = 27 (not 18). -18 - 45 = -63 (not 18). -18 * 45 (too large). -18 / 45 (not integer). 45 / -18 (not integer).

    *   3 * 21 = 63. Now I need to use 45 to get 18. 63 - 45 = 18. This works!
        The numbers are 3, 21, and 45.
        The operations are *, -.
        The equation is (3 * 21) - 45.
        Let's check:
        3 * 21 = 63.
        63 - 45 = 18.
        All numbers (3, 21, 45) are used exactly once.
        The target (18) is reached.
        The operations are basic arithmetic.

Let's double check if there are other possibilities.

The user wants a mathematical equation using the numbers 14, 32, 3, and 23, exactly once each, to equal 84. I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Let's try some combinations.
The target is 84.

Possible operations:
- Multiplication seems like a good way to get closer to 84 quickly.
- 14 * 3 = 42. Then I have 32 and 23 left. 42 + 32 + 23 = 97 (too high). 42 + 32 - 23 = 51 (too low). 42 - 32 + 23 = 33 (too low). 42 - 32 - 23 = -13 (too low).
- 14 * 23 = 322 (too high).
- 14 * 32 = 448 (too high).
- 32 * 3 = 96. Then I have 14 and 23 left. 96 + 14 + 23 = 133. 96 + 14 - 23 = 87. Close! 96 - 14 + 23 = 105. 96 - 14 - 23 = 59.
- 32 * 23 = 736 (too high).
- 3 * 23 = 69. Then I have 14 and 32 left. 69 + 14 + 32 = 115. 69 + 14 - 32 = 51. 69 - 14 + 32 = 87. Close again! 69 - 14 - 32 = 23.

Let's revisit 96 - 14 - 23 = 59. This was from (32 * 3) - 14 - 23.
Let's revisit 69 - 14 + 32 = 87. This was from (3 * 23) - 14 + 32.

Let's try division.
- 32 / 14 (not an integer)
- 32 / 3 (not an integer)
- 32 / 23 (not an integer)
- 14 / 3 (not an integer)

- 3 / 14 (not an integer)
- 3 / 23 (not an integer)
- 23 / 14 (not an integer)
- 23 / 3 (not an integer)

This suggests that division might be used at the end, or in a way that results in an integer.
Or maybe division is not the primary operation.

The target number is 40. The given numbers are 34, 76, 97, and 95.
I need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, /.

Let's try to combine the numbers in different ways.
The numbers are quite large, so division might be involved to reduce the magnitude.
Or, perhaps a large number minus another large number, then adjusted.

Let's try to get close to 40.
95 - 76 = 19. Then I have 34 and 97 left. 19 + 34 + 97 is too big. 19 * 34 is too big.
97 - 95 = 2. Then I have 34 and 76 left. 2 + 34 + 76 is too big. 2 * 34 = 68. 68 + 76 is too big. 68 - 76 is negative.
76 - 34 = 42. Then I have 97 and 95 left. 42 + 97 + 95 is too big. 42 * 97 is too big. 42 - 97 is negative. 42 + 95 = 137. 42 - 95 is negative.

Let's try multiplication first.
34 * 76 is very large.
34 * 97 is very large.
34 * 95 is very large.
76 * 97 is very large.
76 * 95 is very large.
97 * 95 is very large.

Division might be key.
Can I get a number close to 40 by dividing two numbers?
76 / 34 is not an integer.

What if I combine some numbers to make a divisor?
Let's try to make a number that divides into another number to get something around 40.
Or, make a number that, when multiplied by something, gets close to 40.

Let's try to make a number that, when subtracted from a larger number, gives 40.
For example, X - Y = 40.
If X is large, Y must be large too.

Consider the numbers: 34, 76, 97, 95. Target: 40.

Let's try to create a number that, when multiplied by a small number, gets close to 40.
For example, if I can make 20, then 20 * 2 = 40.
Can I make 20 from three numbers?
(97 - 76) * ? = 21 * ?
(95 - 76) * ? = 19 * ?
(97 - 95) * ? = 2 * ?

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by another number, gives 40.
X / Y = 40.
If Y is 1, X must be 40. Can I make 40 from three numbers?
(97 - 34) - ? = 63 - ?
(76 - 34) - ? = 42 - ?
(95 - 34) - ? = 61 - ?

Let's try to make a number that, when added to another number, gives 40.
X + Y = 40.
If X is small, Y must be close to 40.
Can I make a number close to 40 from three numbers?
(97 - 76) + 34 = 21 + 34 = 55.
(95 - 76) + 34 = 19 + 34 = 53.
(76 - 34) + 95 = 42 + 95 = 137.
(97 - 34) + 76 = 63 + 76 = 139.

Let's try to make a number that, when subtracted from another number, gives 40.
X - Y = 40.
If X is large, Y can be large too.
Let's try to make X from two numbers and Y from the other two.
(97 + 34) - (76 - 95) - this is not allowed as 76-95 is negative.
(97 + 34) - (95 - 76) = 131 - 19 = 112.
(97 + 76) - (95 - 34) = 173 - 61 = 112.
(97 + 95) - (76 - 34) = 192 - 42 = 150.

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by another number, results in something that can be adjusted.
For example, (A * B) + C + D = 40.
(A * B) - C - D = 40.
(A * B) + C - D = 40.
(A * B) - C + D = 40.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by another number, results in something that can be adjusted.
(A / B) + C + D = 40.
(A / B) - C - D = 40.
(A / B) + C - D = 40.
(A / B) - C + D = 40.

Let's look at the numbers again: 34, 76, 97, 95. Target: 40.
The numbers 95 and 97 are close. 95 - 97 is negative. 97 - 95 = 2.
The numbers 76 and 34. 76 - 34 = 42.
If I have 42 and 2, how can I get 40?
42 - 2 = 40.
So, (76 - 34) - (97 - 95) = 42 - 2 = 40.
This uses all numbers exactly once and only basic operations.

Let's verify:
(76 - 34) = 42
(97 - 95) = 2
42 - 2 = 40.
This works.

Let's consider other possibilities just to be sure.
What if I try to make a number that divides into something?
For example, can I make 2 from three numbers?
(97 - 95) = 2. Then I have 34 and 76.
Can I make 80 from 34 and 76? 34 + 76 = 110. 76 - 34 = 42. 34 * 76 is too big.
If I had 80, then 80 / 2 = 40.

Let's try to make a number that, when multiplied by something, gets close to 40.
Can I make 10 from three numbers?
(76 - 34) / ? = 42 / ?
(97 - 95) * ? = 2 * ?
(95 - 76) * ? = 19 * ?

Let's go back to the successful one: (76 - 34) - (97 - 95).
This seems like a valid and straightforward solution.

Let's try another structure.
(A + B) - (C + D)
(A - B) + (C - D)
(A * B) / (C * D) - unlikely to be 40.
(A / B) * (C / D) - unlikely.

Let's try to make a number that, when divided by another number, gives 40.
X / Y = 40.
If Y = 1, X = 40. Can I make 1 from three numbers?
(97 - 95) / 2 = 1. But I don't have a 2.
(76 - 34) / 42 = 1.

I found two valid equations:

Let's double check:
Numbers used: 28, 25, 1. All used exactly once.
Operations used: +, -. Basic arithmetic operations.
Result: 52.

Equation: (28 + 25) - 1 = 52
Step 1: 28 + 25 = 53
Step 2: 53 - 1 = 52
This is correct.

Equation: (25 - 1) + 28 = 52
Step 1: 25 - 1 = 24
Step 2: 24 + 28 = 52
This is also correct.

100 - (54 + 6) = 100 - 60 = 40 (no)
100 - 54 + 6 = 46 + 6 = 52 (no)
100 + 54 - 6 = 154 - 6 = 148 (no)
100 / 54 is not integer.
100 / 6 is not integer.

Let's try 54 + 15 = 69. Remaining numbers are 6, 85.
69 + 6 - 85 = 75 - 85 = -10 (close, but negative)
69 - 6 + 85 = 63 + 85 = 148 (no)
69 - 85 + 6 = -16 + 6 = -10 (close, but negative)
69 + 85 - 6 = 154 - 6 = 148 (no)

Let's try 54 - 15 = 39. Remaining numbers are 6, 85.
39 + 6 - 85 = 45 - 85 = -40 (no)
39 - 6 + 85 = 33 + 85 = 118 (no)
39 + 85 - 6 = 124 - 6 = 118 (no)

Let's try 15 - 6 = 9. Remaining numbers are 54, 85.
9 + 54 - 85 = 63 - 85 = -22 (no)
9 - 54 + 85 = -45 + 85 = 40 (no)
9 + 85 - 54 = 94 - 54 = 40 (no)

Let's try 85 - 6 = 79. Remaining numbers are 54, 15.
79 + 15 - 54 = 94 - 54 = 40 (no)
79 - 15 + 54 = 64 + 54 = 118 (no)

Let's try multiplication.
6 * 15 = 90. Remaining numbers are 54, 85.
90 + 54 - 85 = 144 - 85 = 59 (no)
90 - 54 + 85 = 36 + 85 = 121 (no)
90 + 85 - 54 = 175 - 54 = 121 (no)

Let's try 54 / 6 = 9 again. Numbers are 9, 15, 85. Target 10.
What if we use 85 and 15 to get something that helps with 9?
85 - 15 = 70. Then 9 and 70. No obvious way to get 10.
85 + 15 = 100. Then 9 and 100. No obvious way to get 10.

Let's try 85 / 5 = 17. But 5 is not available.

Let's consider the target number 10.
Maybe a large number divided by a combination of others?
Or a combination that results in a multiple of 10.

Let's try to make 10 directly.
Maybe (something) / (something else) = 10.
Or (something) - (something else) = 10.

Consider 85. Can we subtract something from it to get close to 10?
85 - 75 = 10. Can we make 75 from 54, 15, 6?
54 + 15 + 6 = 75.
So, 85 - (54 + 15 + 6) = 85 - 75 = 10.
This uses all numbers exactly once.

Let's verify:
85 - (54 + 15 + 6)
= 85 - (69 + 6)
= 85 - 75
= 10.

This looks correct.

The user wants me to find an arithmetic equation using the numbers 29, 35, 13, and 9 exactly once, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to reach the target value of 42.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations.

Let's list the numbers: [29, 35, 13, 9]
Target: 42

Possible strategies:
1. Start with larger numbers and try to adjust.
2. Try to create intermediate numbers that are factors or multiples of others.
3. Group numbers using parentheses.

Let's try some combinations:

Attempt 1:
(35 + 9) - (29 - 13) = 44 - 16 = 28 (Too low)
(35 - 9) + (29 - 13) = 26 + 16 = 42 (This works!)

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 35, 9, 29, 13. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, -. Allowed.
Result: 42. Target reached.

Let's try another approach to be sure or to see if there are other solutions.

Attempt 2:
(29 + 13) - (35 - 9) = 42 - 26 = 16 (Too low)

Attempt 3:
(35 + 13) - (29 - 9) = 48 - 20 = 28 (Too low)

Attempt 4:
(29 + 9) - (35 - 13) = 38 - 22 = 16 (Too low)

Attempt 5:
(35 * 9) / ? - ?  (35*9 = 315, unlikely to get 42 with 29 and 13)

Attempt 6:
(29 * ?) + ? - ?
(29 * 1) - ?  (Need to make 1 from 35, 13, 9. Not easy)

Attempt 7:
Let's try division.
(35 / ?)
(35 / 13) - not an integer.
(35 / 9) - not an integer.

Attempt 8:
(29 + 35) = 64
64 - 13 = 51
51 - 9 = 42 (This also works!)

Let's verify this:
Numbers used: 29, 35, 13, 9. All used once.
Operations used: +, -, -. Allowed.
Result: 42. Target reached.

So, I have found two valid solutions:
1. (35 - 9) + (29 - 13) = 42
2. 29 + 35 - 13 - 9 = 42

The user asked for ""a valid arithmetic equation"". I will present the second one as it's slightly simpler without parentheses.

Let's double check the second solution:
29 + 35 = 64
64 - 13 = 51
51 - 9 = 42
All numbers [29, 35, 13, 9] are used exactly once.
Only basic operations (+, -) are used.
The target 42 is reached.

Let's consider the first solution again:
(35 - 9) + (29 - 13)
35 - 9 = 26
29 - 13 = 16
26 + 16 = 42
All numbers [29, 35, 13, 9] are used exactly once.
Only basic operations (-, +) are used.
The target 42 is reached.

Both are valid. I will choose one. The second one is more straightforward.

Let's try to see if multiplication or division can be used.
Target 42.
Factors of 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.

Can we make 6 or 7 or 14 or 21 using some numbers and then multiply by others?

Try to make 6:
(29 - ?) / ?
(35 - ?) / ?
(13 - ?) / ?
(9 - ?) / ?

Try to make 7:
(29 - ?) / ?
(35 - ?) / ?
(13 - ?) / ?
(9 - ?) / ?

Try to make 14:
(29 - ?) / ?
(35 - ?) / ?
(13 - ?) / ?
(9 - ?) / ?

Try to make 21:
(29 - ?) / ?
(35 - ?) / ?
(13 - ?) / ?
(9 - ?) / ?

Let's try to make 21 using two numbers:
35 - 13 = 22 (close)
35 - 9 = 26
29 - 9 = 20
29 - 13 = 16
13 + 9 = 22

Let's try to make 21 using three numbers:
(35 + 9) / ? = 44 / ?
(35 - 9) / ? = 26 / ?
(29 + 13) / ? = 42 / ?  -> 42 / 2 = 21. Can we make 2 from 35 and 9? No.
(29 - 13) / ? = 16 / ?

Let's try to make 6 using two numbers:
13 - 9 = 4
9 - ?
13 - ?
35 - 29 = 6.
So, we have 6 from (35 - 29). The remaining numbers are 13 and 9.
Can we multiply 6 by something made from 13 and 9 to get 42?
6 * (13 - 9) = 6 * 4 = 24 (No)
6 * (13 + 9) = 6 * 22 = 132 (No)
6 * (9 / 13) - not integer.
6 * (13 / 9) - not integer.

Let's try to make 7 using two numbers:
13 - 6 (need 6)
9 - 2 (need 2)
29 - 22 (need 22)
35 - 28 (need 28)

Let's try to make 14 using two numbers:
29 - 15 (need 15)
35 - 21 (need 21)
13 + 1 (need 1)
9 + 5 (need 5)

Let's try to make 14 using three numbers:
(29 + 9) - ? = 38 - ?
(35 + 9) - ? = 44 - ?
(29 - 13) + ? = 16 + ?
(35 - 13) + ? = 22 + ?

Let's try to make 3 using two numbers:
13 - 9 = 4
9 - ?
13 - ?
35 - 29 = 6

Let's try to make 3 using three numbers:
(29 + 13) / ? = 42 / ?
(35 + 9) / ? = 44 / ?
(35 - 9) / ? = 26 / ?
(29 - 13) / ? = 16 / ?

Let's try to make 2 using three numbers:
(29 + 13) / ? = 42 / ?
(35 + 9) / ? = 44 / ?
(35 - 9) / ? = 26 / ?
(29 - 13) / ? = 16 / ?

Let's try to make 21 using two numbers:
35 - 14 (need 14)
29 - 8 (need 8)
13 + 8 (need 8)
9 + 12 (need 12)

Let's try to make 21 using three numbers:
(35 + 9) / ? = 44 / ?
(35 - 9) / ? = 26 / ?
(29 + 13) / ? = 42 / ? -> 42 / 2 = 21. Can we make 2 from 35 and 9? No.

The user wants an equation using the numbers 48, 56, 91, and 21 to reach the target number 78.
I can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number must be used exactly once.

Let's list the numbers: [48, 56, 91, 21]
Target: 78

I need to combine these four numbers.
Let's try some combinations.

Maybe start with the larger numbers.
91 and 56.
91 - 56 = 35. Remaining numbers are 48, 21. 35 + 48 + 21 = 104. Too high.
91 + 56 = 147. Remaining numbers are 48, 21. 147 - 48 - 21 = 78. This works!

Let's check the numbers used: 91, 56, 48, 21. All used exactly once.
Let's check the operations: +, -, -. Allowed.
Let's check the result: 91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 147 - 48 - 21 = 99 - 21 = 78.

This looks like a valid solution.

Let's try another approach to confirm or find alternatives.
Maybe division is involved.
91 / 21 is not an integer.
56 / 21 is not an integer.
48 / 21 is not an integer.
91 / 48 is not an integer.
56 / 48 is not an integer.
48 / 56 is not an integer.
21 / 48 is not an integer.
21 / 56 is not an integer.
21 / 91 is not an integer.

So, division might not be the primary operation between the initial numbers unless it results in an integer later.
Let's consider multiplication.
48 * 21 = 1008. Too big.
56 * 21 = 1176. Too big.
91 * 21 = 1911. Too big.
48 * 56 = 2688. Too big.
48 * 91 = 4368. Too big.
56 * 91 = 5100. Too big.

So, multiplication is likely not the first operation unless it's with a small result or followed by significant subtraction.

Let's go back to the first successful attempt: 91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 78.
This is a valid equation.

Let's try to rearrange it to see if other forms exist.
(91 + 56) - (48 + 21) = 147 - 69 = 78. This is also valid.
91 - 48 + 56 - 21 = 43 + 56 - 21 = 99 - 21 = 78. Valid.
91 - 21 + 56 - 48 = 70 + 56 - 48 = 126 - 48 = 78. Valid.

The simplest form is usually preferred.
91 + 56 - 48 - 21 = 78.

Let's try to use multiplication in a different way.
Maybe a number multiplied by a difference?
21 * (something)
If we have 21 * 4 = 84. We need to get 4 from 48, 56, 91.
(56 - 48) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4. This uses 56, 48, 2. But 2 is not available.
(91 - 56) / ?
(48 - 21) = 27.
(56 - 21) = 35.
(91 - 21) = 70.
(91 - 48) = 43.
(56 - 48) = 8.

Let's try multiplication with one of the numbers.
48 * (something)
56 * (something)
91 * (something)
21 * (something)

Consider 21 * 4 = 84. We need to get 4 from 48, 56, 91.
(56 - 48) = 8. Not 4.
(91 - 56) = 35.
(91 - 48) = 43.

What if we multiply two numbers and then add/subtract the others?
48 * 2 = 96. Need 2 from 56, 91, 21. Not possible.
48 * 1 = 48. Need 1 from 56, 91, 21. Not possible.

Let's try to get a number close to 78 using two numbers.
91 - 21 = 70. Remaining: 48, 56. 70 + 48 - 56 = 118 - 56 = 62. No.
70 + 56 - 48 = 126 - 48 = 78. This is 91 - 21 + 56 - 48 = 78. This is the same as one of the earlier ones.

Let's try 56 + 21 = 77. Remaining: 48, 91. 77 + 91 - 48 = 168 - 48 = 120. No.
77 - 91 + 48 = -14 + 48 = 34. No.

Let's try 48 + 21 = 69. Remaining: 56, 91. 69 + 91 - 56 = 160 - 56 = 104. No.
69 - 91 + 56 = -22 + 56 = 34. No.

Let's try 48 + 56 = 104. Remaining: 91, 21. 104 - 91 + 21 = 13 + 21 = 34. No.
104 + 91 - 21 = 195 - 21 = 174. No.
104 - 21 - 91 = 83 - 91 = -8. No.

Let's try 91 - 48 = 43. Remaining: 56, 21. 43 + 56 - 21 = 99 - 21 = 78. This is 91 - 48 + 56 - 21 = 78. Same as before.

Let's try 91 - 56 = 35. Remaining: 48, 21. 35 + 48 - 21 = 83 - 21 = 62. No.
35 - 48 + 21 = -13 + 21 = 8. No.

Let's try multiplication again, but maybe with a smaller number.
What if we multiply 21 by something?
21 * 3 = 63. Need 3 from 48, 56, 91. Not possible.
21 * 4 = 84. Need 4 from 48, 56, 91. Not possible.

What if we multiply 48 by something?
48 * 1 = 48. Need 1 from 56, 91, 21. Not possible.
48 * 2 = 96. Need 2 from 56, 91, 21. Not possible.

What if we use division to create a smaller number to multiply?
(48 / ?)
(56 / ?)
(91 / ?)
(21 / ?)

Let's consider the target 78.
It's an even number.
The numbers are 48 (even), 56 (even), 91 (odd), 21 (odd).
Even + Even = Even
Odd + Odd = Even
Even + Odd = Odd
Even - Even = Even
Odd - Odd = Even

The user wants an equation that uses the numbers [7, 75, 97, 35] exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to equal 50.

Let's list the numbers: 7, 35, 75, 97.
The target is 50.

I need to explore combinations of these numbers and operations.

Strategy 1: Try to get close to 50 with two numbers and then adjust with the others.

*   75 - 35 = 40. Remaining numbers are 7 and 97. Can I get 10 from 7 and 97?
    *   97 + 7 = 104 (too big)
    *   97 - 7 = 90 (too big)
    *   97 * 7 = 679 (too big)
    *   97 / 7 is not an integer.
    *   7 / 97 is not an integer.
    This path doesn't seem promising.

*   75 / 35 is not an integer.
*   75 * 7 = 525 (too big)
*   75 + 7 = 82. Remaining numbers are 35 and 97. Can I get -32 from 35 and 97?
    *   35 - 97 = -62 (not -32)
    *   97 - 35 = 62 (not -32)
    *   35 + 97 = 132
    *   35 * 97 = large
    *   35 / 97
    *   97 / 35
    This path doesn't seem promising.

*   97 - 7 = 90. Remaining numbers are 35 and 75. Can I get -40 from 35 and 75?
    *   35 - 75 = -40. This works!
    So, (97 - 7) + (35 - 75) = 90 + (-40) = 50.
    Let's check if all numbers are used once: 97, 7, 35, 75. Yes.
    Let's check the operations: -, +, -. Yes.
    This looks like a valid solution.

Let's try other combinations to be sure or to see if there are simpler ones.

Strategy 2: Look for divisions that result in integers.
*   75 / ?
    *   75 / 35 (no)
    *   75 / 7 (no)
*   35 / 7 = 5. Remaining numbers are 75 and 97. Can I get 45 from 75 and 97?
    *   75 - 97 = -22 (no)
    *   97 - 75 = 22 (no)
    *   75 + 97 = 172 (no)
    *   75 * 97 (no)
    This path doesn't seem promising.

Strategy 3: Try multiplication to get a larger number and then subtract.
*   7 * 75 = 525. Remaining numbers are 35 and 97. Can I get 525 - 50 = 475 from 35 and 97?
    *   35 + 97 = 132 (no)
    *   97 - 35 = 62 (no)
    *   35 * 97 = 3395 (no)
    This path doesn't seem promising.

*   7 * 35 = 245. Remaining numbers are 75 and 97. Can I get 245 - 50 = 195 from 75 and 97?
    *   75 + 97 = 172 (close, but no)
    *   97 - 75 = 22 (no)
    *   75 * 97 (no)
    This path doesn't seem promising.

*   7 * 97 = 679. Remaining numbers are 35 and 75. Can I get 679 - 50 = 629 from 35 and 75?
    *   35 + 75 = 110 (no)
    *   75 - 35 = 40 (no)
    *   35 * 75 = 2625 (no)
    This path doesn't seem promising.

Let's re-evaluate the first solution found: (97 - 7) + (35 - 75) = 50.
This is (90) + (-40) = 50.
This is a valid solution.

Let's try to rearrange it.
Could it be something like (A op B) op (C op D)?
Or A op (B op (C op D))?

Consider the numbers again: 7, 35, 75, 97. Target: 50.

What if we use division at the end?
(Something) / (Something else) = 50.
This would require one part to be 50 times the other.
Example: (100) / (2) = 50.
Can we make 100 and 2 from the remaining numbers?
Let's try to make 100.
*   75 + 35 - 7 - 97 = 110 - 104 = 6 (no)
*   75 + 97 - 35 - 7 = 172 - 42 = 130 (no)
*   75 + 7 + 35 - 97 = 117 - 97 = 20 (no)

Let's try to make 2.
*   75 / 35 (no)
*   97 / ? (no)
*   35 / 7 = 5. Remaining 75, 97. Can't make 2.

What if we use multiplication at the end?
(Something) * (Something else) = 50.
Possible factors of 50: (1, 50), (2, 25), (5, 10).

Can we make 5 and 10?
*   35 / 7 = 5. Remaining 75, 97. Can we make 10 from 75 and 97? No.
*   Can we make 10? 7 + 3 = 10 (need 3). 75 - 65 = 10 (need 65). 97 - 87 = 10 (need 87).

Can we make 2 and 25?
*   Can we make 2? (See above, difficult).
*   Can we make 25?
    *   75 / 3 = 25 (need 3).
    *   97 - 72 = 25 (need 72).
    *   35 - 10 = 25 (need 10).
    *   7 + 18 = 25 (need 18).

Let's go back to the first solution: (97 - 7) + (35 - 75) = 50.
This is a perfectly valid solution.

Let's try another structure: A + B - C - D or A - B + C - D etc.
*   97 + 35 - 75 - 7 = 132 - 82 = 50.
    Numbers used: 97, 35, 75, 7. All used once.
    Operations: +, -, -. All allowed.
    This is another valid solution. It's simpler than the first one.

Let's check if there are others.
*   97 + 7 - 75 - 35 = 104 - 110 = -6 (no)
*   75 + 35 - 97 - 7 = 110 - 104 = 6 (no)

*   35 + 7 - 97 - 75 = 42 - 172 = -130 (no)

The problem asks me to create an equation using the numbers 66, 2, and 84, exactly once each, with only the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to achieve a target result of 51.

Let's analyze the numbers and the target:
Numbers: 66, 2, 84
Target: 51

The numbers are relatively large, and the target is moderately sized. This suggests that division or subtraction might be important to reduce the magnitude of the numbers, or multiplication might be used strategically.

I need to explore all possible permutations of the numbers and operations. There are 3! = 6 permutations of the numbers:
1. 66, 2, 84
2. 66, 84, 2
3. 2, 66, 84
4. 2, 84, 66
5. 84, 66, 2
6. 84, 2, 66

For each permutation, there are 3 positions for operations, and each position can be one of the 4 operations. This gives 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 possible combinations of operations for each number permutation. However, the order of operations matters (PEMDAS/BODMAS). I need to consider parenthesization as well, but the problem statement implies a linear equation structure. Let's assume standard order of operations unless parentheses are explicitly needed to achieve the result.

Let's start systematically.

Permutation 1: 66, 2, 84
Possible structures:
a) 66 op1 2 op2 84 = 51
b) (66 op1 2) op2 84 = 51
c) 66 op1 (2 op2 84) = 51

Let's try combinations for 66 op1 2 op2 84:

Case 1.1: 66 + 2 + 84 = 152 (Too high)
Case 1.2: 66 + 2 - 84 = -16 (Too low)
Case 1.3: 66 + 2 * 84 = 66 + 168 = 234 (Too high)
Case 1.4: 66 + 2 / 84 = 66 + 0.023... (Not an integer, unlikely to reach 51)
Case 1.5: 66 - 2 + 84 = 64 + 84 = 148 (Too high)
Case 1.6: 66 - 2 - 84 = 64 - 84 = -20 (Too low)
Case 1.7: 66 - 2 * 84 = 66 - 168 = -102 (Too low)
Case 1.8: 66 - 2 / 84 = 66 - 0.023... (Not an integer)
Case 1.9: 66 * 2 + 84 = 132 + 84 = 216 (Too high)
Case 1.10: 66 * 2 - 84 = 132 - 84 = 48 (Close! Need +3)
Case 1.11: 66 * 2 * 84 = 132 * 84 (Very high)
Case 1.12: 66 * 2 / 84 = 132 / 84 = 1.57... (Not an integer)
Case 1.13: 66 / 2 + 84 = 33 + 84 = 117 (Too high)
Case 1.14: 66 / 2 - 84 = 33 - 84 = -51 (Close! Need +102)
Case 1.15: 66 / 2 * 84 = 33 * 84 (Very high)
Case 1.16: 66 / 2 / 84 = 33 / 84 (Not an integer)

Let's consider parentheses for 66 op1 2 op2 84.
Try (66 * 2) - 84 = 132 - 84 = 48. We need 51. We have used 66, 2, 84. This combination is 48. We need to get 51. This means we need to add 3. But we have used all numbers. So this structure doesn't work directly.

Try 66 / 2 - 84 = 33 - 84 = -51. We need 51. This is the negative of our target.

Let's try other permutations.

Permutation 2: 66, 84, 2
a) 66 op1 84 op2 2 = 51

Case 2.1: 66 + 84 + 2 = 152
Case 2.2: 66 + 84 - 2 = 148
Case 2.3: 66 + 84 * 2 = 66 + 168 = 234
Case 2.4: 66 + 84 / 2 = 66 + 42 = 108
Case 2.5: 66 - 84 + 2 = -18 + 2 = -16
Case 2.6: 66 - 84 - 2 = -18 - 2 = -20
Case 2.7: 66 - 84 * 2 = 66 - 168 = -102
Case 2.8: 66 - 84 / 2 = 66 - 42 = 24 (Close! Need +27)
Case 2.9: 66 * 84 + 2 (Very high)
Case 2.10: 66 * 84 - 2 (Very high)
Case 2.11: 66 * 84 * 2 (Very high)
Case 2.12: 66 * 84 / 2 (Very high)
Case 2.13: 66 / 84 + 2 (Not integer)
Case 2.14: 66 / 84 - 2 (Not integer)
Case 2.15: 66 / 84 * 2 (Not integer)
Case 2.16: 66 / 84 / 2 (Not integer)

Let's consider parentheses for 66 op1 84 op2 2.
Try (66 - 84) / 2 = -18 / 2 = -9.
Try 66 - (84 / 2) = 66 - 42 = 24.
