Let's try multiplication first. 9 * 2 = 18 (too high). 9 * 3 = 27 (way too high).
What if I combine 9 and 3? 9 + 3 = 12. Then 12 + 2 = 14 (close).
9 - 3 = 6. Then 6 * 2 = 12 (not 15).
Let's try (9 - 2) * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21 (too high).
How about (9 + 2) - 3 = 11 - 3 = 8 (no).
(9 / 3) = 3. Then 3 * 2 = 6 (no).
What if I try to get to 15?
(9 - 3) * 2 = 6 * 2 = 12.
(9 + 3) + 2 = 14.
(9 + 2) + 3 = 14.

Example 1:
Numbers: [5, 2], Target: 10
<think>I need to use 5 and 2 to get 10.
5 + 2 = 7 (too low)
5 - 2 = 3 (too low)
5 * 2 = 10 (this works!)
</think><answer>5 * 2</answer>

Example 2:
Numbers: [6, 3, 1], Target: 9
<think>I need to use 6, 3, and 1 to get 9.
(6 + 3) * 1 = 9. This is a direct solution.
Alternatively, 6 * 3 = 18 (too high).
(6 - 1) + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 (close)
(6 + 1) + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 (close)
(3 - 1) * 6 = 2 * 6 = 12 (too high)

10 - 2 = 8. Then 8 / 3 (not integer)
Let's reconsider. The target is 4.

Your current task is to take the given set of numbers, <numbers_placeholder>, and combine them using standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to precisely reach the target value, <target_placeholder>. The strict rule is that each number from the provided set must be used exactly one time in your equation.\n\nIf you need to work out the solution step-by-step or explore different combinations, please write these thoughts within <think></think> tags. Once you have derived the final equation, enclose it solely within <answer></answer> tags. Do not include any additional commentary or prose outside of these designated tags.\n\nExample Challenge:\nNumbers: [6, 3, 2], Target: 12\n<think>I need to use 6, 3, 2 to get 12.\n6 * 2 = 12, but I haven't used 3.\n(2 * 3) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 (This works!)\n</think><answer>(2 * 3) + 6</answer>\n\nNow, solve this challenge: <numbers_placeholder>, <target_placeholder>."
